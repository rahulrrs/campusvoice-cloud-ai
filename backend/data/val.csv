"Who TF schedules a conference on the week before finals/during finals. So a very important conference in my field that I need to present at was scheduled for Dec 5-8th. Which is in the final 2 weeks of a semester! Where multiple projects are due, exams are coming up/being taken and everything else going crazy at the end of semester. I'm also a lab TA so I have to take care of my obligations to that. The classes I'm in expect a ton of time out of you for some reason, and a big project is due soon after the conference (plus an exam right before!). My advisors just gave me a laundry list of things that I still gotta do for the presentation, and I'm absolutely slammed to the point where I can barely think about anything else. I would literally not be anywhere near this stressed if the conference were scheduled at a different time of the year, yet here it is. Also I might have Covid and mild symptoms so everything might just be moot to begin with. I'll get tested on Friday, and if I'm negative, I will have to go to the conference. I guess my time management throughout the semester could've been better, but holy shit. I was supposed to practice presenting today but I've been literally too busy trying to do everything else so I have nothing. I might have nothing because I might have Covid, idk.

"Potential bullying of professor by students. Dear all, First of all, this will be a very personal post, because this is about one of my parents. My parents are college professors, and I am also an undergraduate student, so as a family, we are experiencing both aspects of college, but we're all struggling in different ways. Although we are all American citizens, we have moved to the US from our native country several years ago. So, my mother started teaching at a new (public state) university with a very different student body than what she had back in the old country. In 2024, she had a medical emergency that almost got her blind, and now she has limited eyesight, which is just the cherry on top, as we are also financially struggling, and my father's health is not good. I am not in the position to evaluate her teaching skills myself, but some of her very first end-of-the-semester reviews from the students were very critical, which is a switch from when she was well-liked in our native country. Even though only up to 5 students per class filled out the forms, she was really affected by the comments. She partially healed and continued looking forward. The semester when the aforementioned medical emergency happened, the reviews were about the same. The problem was that some made fun of her medical emergency, and some likened my mother to a pirate. This hurt as it's about my mother, but as a student, I have never seen such incivility even in high school. Recently, she has started complaining to me about some of her students who are rarely attending or are always sitting at the back and making weird faces at her as she is giving the lecture. I feel like this situation has gotten similar to bullying, and she has even mentioned resigning just because some of her students don't know how to behave. She doesn't exactly take any input from me and doesn't use Reddit or other types of media for anonymous advice. But I'm concerned for her well-being. I wanted to get your input on how I can help her.

"My Heart Goes Out to Composition Professors. I'm a science instructor and non-traditional pre-medical student who has decided to pursue medicine in my early 40s. As part of the medical school requirements, I had to take all of my pre-requisites over again, including two English composition classes. My final paper in English 102 was on a topic tangentially related to my thesis, which I wrote many years ago. I knew the basics of my chosen topic, but I have also wanted to investigate it thoroughly for years. The requirement was an 8-10 page paper with a minimum of five sources. I included 35 peer-reviewed articles on my works cited page. Today, my instructor asked me to stay after class to discuss my paper. Admittedly, I was nervous since I know how rampant AI usage is among undergraduates, and I was concerned I'd be wrongly accused of using it. He asked me what my strategy was for writing the paper. I told him I started with review articles to learn the essentials and then used the references to dive deeper into the primary literature. He handed me a printed copy of my paper with one small correction, telling me it was extremely well done. What struck me was that I could tell he was getting emotional as he thanked me for my commitment to his class. Apparently, he's been dealing with paper after paper of AI-generated trash for a couple of years, and my effort was a breath of fresh air. We don't deal with AI problems quite as much in science, but it made me think of this subreddit and the struggles of composition instructors.

"I think my PI is crazy. (rant). For the past term (7 weeks), I have suffered under this one crazy PI. Unfortunately, this PI is also the professor I TA for. So for the future generations who are suffering from insane professors, or are wondering about it, let this be some of the warning signs that tells you this *ain't the place that's good for your smile*. Sign 1: public put-downs. Maybe it hasn't happened to you yet, but does your professor pick on someone in front of everyone else? This is actually called office bullying, and it shouldn't be happening. Remember - what might happen to Bob sitting next to you might happen to you tomorrow. Sign 2: the PI micromanages. Most professors want to be left alone. They don't want to read a billion emails. However, I had the misfortune of having a PI who wanted to be cc-ed in on *everything*. And when I say everything, I do mean everything. The PI checked every grading I ever did, asked to be cc-ed in on every email I sent out to a student, proofread announcements before I posted them (including the one where I just said ""here's the answer key""). Micromanaging can be debilitating to an office environment, create toxic relationships, and interfere with relationships. Sign 3: The PI does not allow you to disagree. On anything. Ever. The reason why you are getting your PhD is to start on your career to show that more than anything else, you are capable of independent thought, testing that thought, and proving to someone else that your thoughts merit consideration (at least) and their time. So if your PI does not allow you to disagree, how will you learn to think for yourself, test your ideas, and be you? Einstein was a great scientist, but the truth is, we don't need 30 Einstein's. What we need is one Einstein, one Feynman, one Maxwell. and one you. Everyone has something to contribute, and it is the PI's job to help the student equip themselves with the techniques to get the necessary tools to support and prove one's thought. It is NOT the PI's job to make an army of PI's clones. This is one of the best advice I received from my mentor: ""We don't need thirty Richard Feynman's. We've already had a Feynman. We need people with different thoughts and different angles."" Sign 4: The PI expects you to grovel, or otherwise feed the PI's ego. It is not the student's job to worship the PI. If you do, that's great, but if you don't, you shouldn't have to be forced into apologising every minute and thanking your PI for reading the abstract that your PI demanded of you the previous night. It is not your job to take care of your PI's insecurity, and to be punished because you don't is unfair. Sign 5: The entire lab hates the PI. Believe it or not, not everyone sticks around because they are in love with the PI. They might have invested too much time, or they might not have anywhere else to go. But before you eagerly sign up for the lab and put your name down in blood and carve it into stone, ask the potential labmates about the PI (or, if not that, then ask the other students in the department). They might not outright condemn the person, but if the student pauses before saying anything, that might be a sign to run. Remember your undergrad: a good professor was almost universally loved, an okay professor had enemies and had adorers, and bad professors were pretty much hated across the board. That's the same in grad school. Sign 6: Your PI changes ideas or adds ideas. every minute. Does your PI send you a dozen emails a day? Does your PI change ideas, asks you to do one thing then change minds the next moment? Are you constantly confused on what to do? That's not your fault, and that shows lack of planning and forethought. This might reflect on your dissertation path, and then you might be in trouble. Sign 7: Your PI has mood swings. And you can tell. Everyone has bad days, good days, and mood swings. But some people can control it to an acceptable level. and then some people lash out at everything and everyone. This seriously taxes you emotionally and can create an awful spiral that can leave you feeling isolated and demoralised and unsure of what to do. Sign 8: your PI's lab is curiously small. Is your PI just in the third year on the tenure-track? Then only having three graduate students makes sense. Is your PI in the 20th year at the institution yet only has had a handful of students, including those in the lab right now? Is your PI endowed and ""famous"" yet his/her lab is curiously small? There might be a good reason for that. Now, some PIs just don't like big labs because they want to mentor the students closely, and if this is the case, that's great unless the PI is a micromanager. But if it's not like there are half a dozen students flocking to the PI's door and the PI's refusing every one of them. there might be a reason why the lab is so small. So what to do? 1. If you can, and if it's seriously hampering your happiness, *leave* the lab. This can be a tumultuous decision, but many people actually do it. 2. Discreetly inform someone. By discreet, I mean that you should make sure the person you reported to doesn't take off and yell at the PI. but make sure your voice is heard. 3. If you feel: lethargic, oddly unenthusiastic, just downright hard to get out of bed that does not involve physical fatigue, tearful for no reason, or any other symptoms that is otherwise not like you: seek medical help. You may be on your path to mental illness. Even if you might not be, it cannot hurt to have the fact that you sought help documented. (If there's anything else anyone likes to add, please feel free.

Lesser issues, not being available during office hours, refusing to communicate via email, only in person (my thoughts is its to avoid a paper trail), and not allowing students into the course if late. Late could mean hardly a minute, or more, depending on when he wanted to close the door. A student was publicly berated for ahowing up 5 minutes late to an 80 minute course. Pretty ugly.

"Feeling like dog water. I’m currently a senior in international studies and economics with a GPA of 3.0 and feel like the dog water every day. I used to be passionate and loved learning, but after deciding to double major with Econ I’m so incredibly miserable and feel so inadequate at literally everything. I’m an insecure person but what always brought me pride was that I was smart and capable, but now after 3 semesters in a row with only Cs and Bs and passing only because of curves I don’t even know who I am anymore.

"* Students often use translation tools to bypass learning the vocabulary and structures they should be mastering. For instance, in Fred's Spanish class, students learn to say their name as *me llamo.* A student who skips this lesson might turn to Google for *my name is.*, finding both *mi nombre es.* and *me llamo.* The student, unfamiliar with the essential structure, chooses *mi nombre es.*, which sounds more intuitive to an English speaker, sidestepping the intended lesson. * Google Translate is a poor choice for language students.

"Feeling beat down by Rate My Professors (Grad Student Instructor). Hi folks, I’m a long time lurker and this is my first time posting - I’m a grad student instructor who just finished teaching 500 students in an asynchronous class. Apologies for the saga but I need a space to release these feelings about Rate My Professor (RMP) posts. During the first week, I openly stated that I ask conceptual questions on the exams (40 questions, untimed, open notes). I make it VERY clear that I do not want them to engage in rote memorization, which I think they’re accustomed to in other classes. My discipline is also considered ""soft"" or ""easy"", which may color their expectations. While the vast majority of students are rating the class positively, nearly every comment (there are less than 10) mentions my difficult exams with “confusing” questions. It’s a comment that I take seriously because I want to understand what is confusing. I have dropped a few questions this quarter due to errors. I also decided to award credit for two answers for one question because I was worried that they couldn’t quite parse out the nuances between the two answer choices based on the guest lecture content (another grad student recorded a lecture). My TA mentioned to me that she’s worried that students may be more inclined to demand more when I express this kind of humility - but this feels like such a bleak, pessimistic view of students. I've had almost no students express confusion AND my students are doing well (A- averages on exams). There’s no indication that my questions are generally confusing or highly difficult (and quiz statistics suggest the majority of questions are low difficulty level). There are usually only 3-5 ""highly"" difficult questions on an exam. I don’t want to confuse students but I do want to encourage them to critically think - are folks here finding that conceptual questions are inherently more confusing for students? All this being said, these are all the intrusive thoughts camping inside my head: 1. I feel so…foolish…that I tried to create an assessment structure rooted in critical thought. The students seem so aversive to this - I know I’m now old man who yells at clouds, but I feel dispirited that my students seem upset that an asynchronous class required some work from them. I recognize that students probably have specific expectations for an asynchronous class, which has probably amplified the chorus of students chanting, “Confusing!” 2. In spite of high performance, the reviews paint my class as very difficult. It just feels like an unfair, hyperbolized description when students are not only doing well on my assessments but the VAST majority of my questions are easy. One review claims you can spend hours working through the exams and barely receive a passing score. Another student said no one wants to spend 3 hours taking an exam, which feels like they’re complaining they have unlimited time? I wanted to provide flexibility which is why I opted for the untimed option (the other instructor who teaches the course offers the same thing). I’m now wondering if the untimed exams actually creates an environment where I’ve given them too much of a cushion. 3. One review says that I’m unclear in recorded lectures, which has hurt their exam performance. This is the first time I’ve received this feedback and I feel so frustrated that I don’t know what is unclear in lectures. I hate the alienating, asynchronous structure and worry that it fuels student malaise and disgruntlement. While I am a highly accessible instructor, I know maybe 5 of my students out of 500 who are wonderful, bright, and hard workers! 4. Another instructor who teaches the same class has glorious ratings on Rate My Professor and offers an extremely bare bones asynchronous class. Everything is untimed, open notes, and multiple attempts allowed on all quizzes and exams (same questions) so every student passes with flying colors. No required textbook or readings either whereas I require them to read 2 empirical articles per week. I know the data is clear that easy professors are rewarded but it feels so disheartening. I know how little effort the other instructor puts into their course and how much effort I’ve poured into mine only to feel like I've failed to some degree. 5. I HATE HATE HATE having a public job profile. It gnaws away at my soul that ANYONE can post anything about me on RMP with zero verification. I can’t think of a single other job where people are invited to openly complain about you in a designated, public space. I’m feeling especially vulnerable because I’m entering the job market this fall. I don't think anything on RMP would actively tank my application but the fact that any job search committee could read these comments makes me feel.queasy (even though they're generally positive). 6. I'm very worried I'll be skewered alive by my course evaluation feedback. When I taught this class in the summer, students rated the class very positively. However, I was only managing 170 students in a summer session - teaching 500 students has certainly amplified the chorus of criticism. I know it’s probably a rookie mistake to take this feedback to heart (it’s a tiny sample size, can’t make everyone happy, etc.) but I am so dejected.

"College canceled loan without notification. My big question is if this is legal, as it really doesn't seem like it should be to me. This occurred with CSUB, California State University of Bakersfield. My father is a Navy veteran and so I qualify for VA assistance to cover my tuition costs from CSUB. The VA and CSUB already had all the paperwork sorted out. I know this because I had already received a letter from the VA affirming this, many weeks ago. However, I still need money to cover transportation costs and fee's not related to tuition. Once I had all my classes charged to my student account and had completed all the necessary documents to receive student loans 2 options were awarded. I was able to take a ~3,500 subsidized loan for the year and up to I think $5,000 subsidized. I decided that I would take out the max for my subsidized loan for the first year and I could take out more later if I needed it. So I accepted the loan and the math had come out to around ~1,735 after a loan fee, per semester. In the next few days is where the actual issue comes from. They deducted around $700 to pay for fee's (as is standard) and then two days after that refunded the remaining money to my personal bank account. However, a few days after that I see that not only are the $700 of fee's back on my account there is now a future negative balance for the rest of the loan. I called the financial aid office and they told me that once my VA benefits had kicked in my expected need had dropped and disqualified me from subsidized loans. They didn't back charge my bank account for loan size and to my knowledge they hadn't notified me that my loan had been canceled. So now on top of my initial $700 of fee's I owe them an extra $1,000 from the loan. This is an issue because I ordered books with the money and now don't have the $1,000 total. Had they notified me or canceled the direct deposit I wouldn't have spent it. Shouldn't they have known that the VA benefits would have disqualified me before even allowing me to take out the loan? I've also posted this in r/legaladvice. I'm posting here aswell because I figured you guys might have some insight for this issue as well",Library,Medium,1.0,web:reddit:r/college:search:fee issue,Medium,1,2187,410,13,College canceled loan without notification.,0
"First round of class feedback. Is this common. Only had three of my sixteen students submit feedback. It was generally positive, but the comments themselves were eye catching. One lamented that there weren’t enough assignments, and if they did poorly on one it would tank their “GPA.” I’m sure they meant grade. There were 25 quizzes, mid-term and final exams, and three papers. I suspect they did really poorly on one paper. I allowed corrections on the first two, but for the third I offered feedback if they sent me their draft. Only one student bothered. One, though, submitted a long review accusing me of singling them out and trying to embarrass them in front of their friends, including the apparently INEXCUSABLE crime of telling them they were wrong about something. They said I spoke down to them, cut them off, and gave them harder questions than anyone else. The feedback also included a complaint that instead of a “pat on the back” I asked them to do better work. I’m pretty sure I know which student this was. She failed to write even a passable analysis on the first two attempts, then did a decent but not great job on the last one. She kept telling me she’s a “4.0 student,” but wasn’t capable of even basic analysis. I spent several after-class sessions giving her guidance. As a first time adjunct, it’s a little surprising.

"Should I tell my professor my lab partner was cheating/asking me how to cheat in the class. Taking a science class this semester, and I'm working with a group that I had class with before. Yesterday we had our first quiz, and one of the people in my group had sneakily taken a photo of the quiz to upload onto ChatGPT for the answers while the professor was passing the paper around to other students. Despite this, they were still trying to ask me what the answers were because they knew I studied for the quiz. I attempted to write small and cover my paper with my arm and hair so they wouldn't see my answers. Not only that, this person is always on their phone during lecture and lab, and it's becoming a distraction. I spent more time reexplaining the lab procedure to this person than getting good lab results, because I was getting distracted most of the time. We have an exam coming up, and because I already had this professor before, a lot of people came up to me asking what the professor's exams are like. I'm more than happy to share what I experienced and how I studied. As the exams take place in a computer lab, the same lab partner asked how big the exam room is and which computers are most discreet so the professor can't see them as well. I, of course, said nothing because if you're trying to go into a health field, maybe don't cheat and get others involved. It's only been a week of class, and it has been bothering me so much because I respect this professor, and I don't want to be associated with cheaters and get into trouble for something I want no part of. Not to mention, this science course is a microbiology class, and the professor makes a huge deal about cross-contamination and how phones can create issues in our lab results because of the high levels of bacteria phones carry. This person is always on their phone, and it bothers me as I can directly see it, and we have to share test tubes and bacteria samples.

"I hate the college life. This is a long read, so please bear with me. It's been a year since I've come to campus and I have end sem exams for 2-2 next month. To begin with, my marks on the admission test were so pathetic that I was sure I would never get a seat. Thanks to the unprecedented drop in cutoffs that year, I got in purely by chance (Not a circuital branch or dual, but it's something). Now, the institute shows me that I do not deserve my spot. In 1-1, I did get a decent CG, something above 7.5 but less than 8, however, since my roomie back then scored above 8, I was disappointed with my grades. In 1-2, my grades fell down to a 6 and that set me back. In 2-1, I bounced back and scored something similar to 1-1. Now, in 2-2, I'm getting avg- in evals and mid-sems and I'm sure my grade is going to drop to 6 again. At least in 1-2, there was a saving grace in one subject which saved me from going down to 5; now there's no such course this time. I hate every second on campus. I attend classes regularly, but that's only because I have nothing else to do in the hostel, and I have to get through the day doing something. But the truth is, even though I attend classes, I never understand anything. I'm always distracted. I just learn for a few hours the day before the exam and wing it. Then I forget all about it. I'm in 3 clubs, and by now, I'm getting bored with them too. I don't do much in clubs. I thought I could learn a new tech skill outside of clubs by myself, but I can't even get into that. I have no friends; I'm always alone. My roommate doesn't speak with me, but I can't blame him, since I've never attempted to get along. I have a close bond with my family, but too bad they're nearly 2000 km away, and I can't go home so easily. This entire campus feels like a prison, and I can't wait to get out of here. I thought I'd get 2 months' holiday at the end of 1-2, but since I was a NAC student, the vacation was cut short to 2 weeks. Even now I'm afraid I can't go home, since PS-I is coming up and I may not get a station close to home, or an online station for that matter. Admittedly, I have no meaningful skills. I have no passion for life. I don't know what I want to do. I'm not sure if I will get a job after I finish college, or if I'll even finish college. What's the point of life? I just want to go home, do nothing for a month, and then come back. But one month is a long time, and I would be left in the dust if I leave acads now, so I can't even take that risk. In conclusion, I'm a prisoner: a prisoner of time, a prisoner of society, and a prisoner of the institute And since my grade is low, I don't even think I'd get a PS station(A mandatory internship program by the institute) of my preference (nothing much, just something close to home). I have to put up with a shitty PS Station in some godforsaken village and tolerate it for 2 months. Then, I'd have to come back to this godforsaken campus located in a village and spend the next 8 months here. Then, in 4-1 or 4-2, I'll have to once again put up with another shitty village for PS-II for 4 months. Overall, I don't think I'll ever be going home till college ends. At the end of it all, I don't even think I'll get a job. I have nothing to write on resume. There is no point in my life. Maybe it's best if I end it now. I know for a fact life is going to get so much more difficult after college. And given how I'm suffering in college, I'll never be ready for whatever is beyond. I should just commit suicide when I'm still young. I've had this thought for 4 years now. And day by day, I have no reason to live through this living hell. And before any of you say I should try to socialize or try new hobbies, believe me, I tried all of that. As an introvert, I've never been able to get along with anyone. There was a guy in 1st year, but he was toxic, so I had to push him away. Most of my classmates know that I have some bottled up issues, so I can't get along with them either.

"13 Minute Finals Crisis 2. As I mentioned in my original post titled ""[13 Minute Finals](https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/gft0ne/13_minute_finals/)"" my \*adjunct\* (sorry, I kept saying professor but she's an adjunct lecturer) decided that evaluating 157 students (I found out a few dropped the class so not 160 anymore) on a 13 minute finals worth 40% of our grade with 10 lengthy questions (based on someone who's taken the exam already - it's lengthy, alright) is genius! I followed what over 80 of you guys said and raised the issue up the food chain. I took what someone said specifically and went straight for the president, both deans, and every divisional chair (just 4) - I've been ignored repeatedly by some faculty, staff, offices for months anyways so this ensured I'll get a timely response. There's no time to waste. I asked all 157 classmates and dozens said that they've emailed the adjunct before who quote on quote does not believe the 13 minutes is an issue and will not accommodate them. I saw a variety of issues - internet issues or no internet at all, family issues, anxiety, can't even read, etc. The chair of the department replied (surprisingly, this guy is a butthead based on my previous experiences) and said that the adjunct does \*not\* know of my concerns which is ridiculous. I've seen those emails that peers have emailed to her in which she \*replied.\* The chair told me to try to resolve with her otherwise I can go back to him with my fists of fury. I'm def. going to email the adjunct but what should I say? If she's not accommodating the first time, what about now? I swear I'm wasting my time here, so I'm trying to gather next steps now just in case she's a butthead again. She even lied saying she doesn't know our concern when there is email proof. She herself said she goes through hundreds of emails and b/c she got annoyed, she sent emails to all 157 of us saying something along the lines of: Yes, the exam is 13 minutes. No I am not doing anything about it. The average is a 30-40. The finals will be the same. (In other words, our complaints were real, a lot, and it was annoying her.) I am currently reaching out to a lot of other people I know to get advice, maybe even get their support - they are not students. Us students seem to no have power in deciding our own future in this school. Let me know what I should do.

"Math PhD with No Internships for AI Industry Research: Bad Idea. I received a fully funded PhD scholarship in Mathematics. Originally, I applied for a PhD in Computer Science, but since the PI is affiliated with both departments, the scholarship was formally offered under Mathematics instead. My main motivation for pursuing a PhD has always been industry research, not academia. I’m particularly interested in roles at places like DeepMind, FAIR, or smaller, niche AI research labs. From what I can tell, these positions typically expect a PhD in CS / ML (or very closely related fields), and a PhD in Mathematics does not seem to be the standard, or even explicitly listed, in most cases. I am not interested in becoming a professor. I see the PhD primarily as a means to access research-oriented industry roles, not as an academic career path in itself. That said, there are several red flags that are making me hesitate: 1. The PI is very new. I would be their second PhD student, and the first one is now a postdoc, still in academia. 2. The PI has few publications, mostly in mathematics, and a very low h-index. 3. The scholarship itself has some worrying conditions: * Internships are not allowed. * If I decide to leave the PhD early, they may require full reimbursement of the scholarship. The internship restriction is especially concerning, since I want to move into industry research and not stay in academia. At this point, the only reasons I still see for going forward are: 1. Is it realistically possible to enter big tech / AI research labs without top-tier publications and without internships? 2. Gaining research experience and living abroad. 3. I genuinely find the research topic very interesting (I can share more details via DM; I’d prefer not to be too identifiable here). One more important piece of context: I am already working as a software engineer, although with a very old tech stack and in a sector I don’t enjoy (defense). Because of this, an alternative plan would be to decline this scholarship, keep working for now, and apply again next year, which realistically might be my last chance, since I’m already 28.

"Struggling to focus in class, stuck in a cycle of distraction—need help breaking out of it. I'm in desperate need of help so here it goes. Hey, my name is Miguel. I'm a 19‑year‑old cinema uni student and I desperately need you guys’ help. I have both ADHD and Autism and, because of this, my attention span is really bad (which is ironic because when I was little I used to read a lot) and it's starting to be a problem. This is because I have a 3‑hour class and I can’t concentrate or pay attention to what the teacher is saying for more than 5 minutes before I end up picking up my phone or going on my computer. This wouldn’t be much of an issue if I knew how to take notes and recognize when the teacher is discussing important stuff so I could focus—but I really don’t know how. You might be asking, ""Oh, why don’t you ask a colleague for his class notes and summaries?"" Because I haven’t made any friends here or gotten really close with anyone. I don’t know anyone from other years who can help me. I’m just acquaintances with some people in my class, and I feel really bad asking folks I don’t really know or trust for their notes and summaries. Plus, no one in my class gives a fuck about me or talks to me just because they want to—they only come around when they need something or when they have to. Because of that, I’ve started being on my phone all the time, even during classes. Since last semester, I’ve been recording my classes so I can listen to them at home and do my notes at my own pace. But when I get home, I don’t have any energy or motivation to do anything, so I just procrastinate and end up on my phone. When I have a project or a job to deliver, I end up doing it on the weekend before the deadline or just days before—only doing it to pass and prove my parents wrong. And when I sit down at the computer determined and focused to work, something else always catches my attention, and I end up doing something completely different. These constant distractions have even stopped me from watching movies on my computer, which is something I want to do to improve my knowledge as a filmmaker and cinephile. Being on my phone so much and feeling so lonely has completely wrecked my attention span (which, until 4 or 5 years ago when I got my first phone, was actually great). Now, because of that, I can’t concentrate—I’m pretty much addicted to it and can’t seem to put it down all day. This has been happening since last semester, but now it’s reached a point where I can no longer deny that I need help. I’m desperate to change this before I fail two classes in my course. You might ask, ""Oh, if this has been happening since last semester, why aren’t you only asking for help now?"" Last semester, I managed because some classes were a bit easier and I could get by with some notes I was making, group projects with smarter people, and by sitting in class with a few friends I used to hang out with. But due to some external factors, I stopped hanging out with them—which only led me to be on my phone more and lose the close connections I once had. What led me to realize I need help was that I have two really hard classes this semester that I don’t understand at all. Today, during an in‑class assessment that counted toward my grade, I realized I didn’t remember anything from what was said or provided in that discipline. So, what should I do to get my attention span back, be able to concentrate in class, stop being on my phone constantly, overcome the lack of motivation when I get home, stop procrastinating so much, and learn how to take proper notes and summaries?",Faculty,High,2.0,web:pullpush:r/students:submission:issue,High,2,3604,680,6,"Struggling to focus in class, stuck in a cycle of distraction—need help breaking out of it.",0

"Night owl and productivity issues. Hi all, I am currently doing my PhD in the Humanities, and I have troubles with keeping a 'normal' life rhythm, especially during work rushes. I have issues with productivity. Some days I will be absolutely unable to do anything (barely able to get out of bed, let alone to write anything good), and some days will be great. My issue is that when I have great days, I have to compensate for the time lost on 'bad' days, and work longer hours. My other issue is that I am a night owl, my productive hours start at 2/3pm. I am able to work long hours (4/5 hours before taking a break), so when I have a deadline I usually end up working until 2 or 3 am. This makes it a bit difficult to keep with family life (no kids, thankfully), events, and even emails, because most of my colleagues are morning people. Overall, in the week, I do all the work I have to, and I always meet my deadlines (unless I set myself to unreasonable deadlines but that is another issue). At the moment it is okay, since I do not have to teach or attend workshops or such, but I am afraid that if I start getting used to this work rhythm I will struggle getting back to the usual 9-5 that I am supposed to keep, which will then lead to insomnia and a lack of productivity (I am utterly useless in the morning). So I am asking the other PhD night owls out here, did you keep with your natural patterns and switched to the night shift, or did you somehow 'train' yourself to work 9-5? If so how, and do you have any advice on how to make this better?

"I went to college immediately after high-school, and failed almost every class my first semester and then withdrew early in the second. The following fall semester I had transferred to a closer college, failed almost all my classes that semester and then I did fail all my classes the semester after. I had a 0.7 GPA. I was depressed, I had social anxiety, I was aimless, etc. After that semester I gave up on college and started working. Spent five years working, and wound up deeply regretting how poorly I did in college and really wishing I could get a degree. I thought there was literally zero chance any school would ever look at my previous academic record and even pretend to consider admitting me. But they did. It took basically an entire summer of writing personal essays about why I did poorly before and why I think I'd do better now, and talking to different members of the transfer department and continuing education department. But I did get back into college, and while I certainly still struggle from some of those same issues I did before, I've got a 3.4 GPA and am doing plenty well enough. I know it feels like it's the end of the world and that there's no future, but you're alright. If college isn't working for you right now, that's okay. Take some time off, treat yourself well, and give yourself time to figure out who you want to be and what you want to do. If that means going back to college, that's okay. You can do that.

"Trying to submit a transcript on time with an incomplete. Okay so this might be long, there’s a lot that’s happened to get me to this point. TL;DR at the end. A few semesters ago I found out about a costuming class that my college offers. I thought it would be a great way to see whether I wanted to give costuming a try or not. It ended up not being what I expected at all and was essentially just doing the “costuming intern” job but for 1 credit instead of pay. I had issues before I even joined the class and kept having to deal with people not responding to my emails. For background, there is the official instructor W and the person who is the actual costumer, E. I won’t bore you with the details but I finally got into the course Fall 2018. Only one other person was enrolled and I never saw her again after the orientation. The class has no meeting time so it was up to me to be there when E was available. This was typically Wednesday and Thursday 12-5. Well, i had class until about 2-3 every day and E told me to not bother coming in if it will only be for a few hours. I also had a job at the campus library in which I could only work nights as well as my retail job in which my shift would start at 5. I was responsible for doing 40 hours of work throughout the semester and ended up getting in roughly 20. I took off a whole week of work from both jobs to help with the fall play and ended up just sitting back stage the whole time waiting for a singular costume change to happen. I kept putting off finishing my hours and eventually finals started to look. I admit that I texted E pretty late about finishing my hours on time, but she read my text and never responded. I emailed W, who didn’t respond for a week. I went to a counselor and explained the situation, and she told me to just drop the class/fail it since my grades were good enough to handle it. I have a 3.67 right now and 17 more credits to finish this semester. I ended up getting an incomplete and now here we are. My transcript for U of M is due February 1st and i’ve been freaking out about it for days. How will they see my incomplete/failure? I sent E a text asking if she could put in a holder grade just so I could submit my transcript. I realize that this is unethical and I don’t disagree with her on that. However, I was thinking that she could just put in a C or a D since i have completed half the hours. I had an international travel course that did essentially this since the grades were due before we actually went. [text log](https://imgur.com/a/2uRlbCE) Now, this course has been a headache for me since the beginning of Fall 2018. I have repeatedly tried to get materials from her and been told that she wasn’t in and to try later. I waited for 2 hours for E one time to get a tour of the costume shop. I have shown up multiple times to the shop (20 minute drive one way) only to find she wasn’t there and the doors were locked. I took off a week of work only to sit and do practically nothing. E saying that I said I would come in several times and didn’t show is a lie. I don’t know what to do. Can i just not complete the hours and submit my transcript now? How will an incomplete look for a 1 credit course? Do i need to drop it? How do I explain to my counselor that I’m dropping without saying that I tried to get E to put a holder grade in? TL;DR: At the fault of my own and my instructor’s, I haven’t completed the necessary hours for a 1 credit elective course. I got an incomplete to finish it this semester but I don’t have the time/willpower to put up with my instructor to finish it before my transcript is due. What do I do?

"t’s mostly due to government funding. In Germany, the state covers the majority of university costs through taxes. Higher education is seen as a public good, so students generally don’t pay tuition fees at public universities—just a small semester contribution. And for students from low-income families, there’s something called BAföG (short for “Bundesausbildungsförderungsgesetz”).

So I noticed that my grade was a full letter grade lower than I predicted and that’s because he made all the points for everything equally weighted. So I emailed him explaining him the problem I saw and asking for clarification and he emailed me back with this: “I’m not sure what sort of formulas you are using, but the way I approached the issue points was you had 245 points possible through all of the assignments up until the final two.-the final two is the paper and exam- The research paper was worth about 50% of your final grade, so I made it 100 points, which is less than half, but close. Similarly the final exam was about 25% so 50 point. I do any of that grade weighting you’re describing.” I don’t know how to explain to him that he is wrong and 100 points out of 395 is not near 50%.

"how to cope with no alone time while being in school. hi friends. i’m only in my 2 year of college so I would love any advice from people who’ve been at it a little bit longer. my current schedule is classes 9-1 on M/W and 8-12:30 on T/Th. i live on campus so not everyday do i got home during this break but i either eat for an hour or go do homework at the library. then i leave for work M-F at 2:30 and get home at 8:30. pretty long days, but i don’t have classes on Fridays and still get my weekends so Im not complaining at all. my issue lies within my roommate. we share a 1 bedroom so shared bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, all the things. she’s nice for the most part, very anxious person but overall were friends. right now i leave the house before she’s awake every single day so im getting ready in the bathroom and tip toeing around our room. if i do go home during my mid-day break, she is always in our bedroom just in her bed. and by the time i get home from work every night she’s again, in her bed, and 9/10 on the phone with her bf. she doesn’t work and pretty much only leaves the house for her in-person classes so i know she is getting ample time at home. sometimes i’ll invite her to plans i have with friends to get her out but it started becoming the expectation she was always invited so i pushed back a little. i don’t care about any of this, just trying to paint a picture of how im getting maybe 4 hours of alone time throughout the week and its finally driving me insane. even tho i have gripes with her literally never giving me a moment alone, she has no obligation to that and is paying for the space so who am i to judge how she uses it. so my biggest question is how do i cope? how do i become ok with the fact i don’t really have any time alone throughout my very long week? should i be trying to incorporate more alone time within my routine or is it a lost cause until i move out? thanks for any thoughts :)",Examination,Medium,1.0,web:pullpush:r/college:submission:library,Medium,1,1940,389,5,how to cope with no alone time while being in school.,0

"Need advice (concerning lab responsibility). Hey all! &amp;#x200B; Okay so, I'm a part of two labs at the moment (2nd year grad student) and I help run health assessments in one of them. Let's call this the secondary lab. I'm also the data manager on that project and the project lead is also a 2nd year graduate student. Everybody else on the project, besides PI, are either close to graduating undergrad or post-bacc. Enter, let's call her Susie. She's also a part of both labs, however she's a post-bacc who is interning for 20 hours a week. We have similar meeting schedules because our primary lab has regular lab meetings, journal clubs, etc. I spend more time in the lab than 20/week, obviously, because we run on a 9-5 office schedule. And, I'm here later than that regularly, as well. &amp;#x200B; Circumstance: We need to enter in our availability for next month's assessments and I noticed that Susie checked that she was unavailable in the time periods that I know we have our journal club, and also the time we have our trainee meeting. Petty: Our Journal clubs are not structured enough where we need to block that time off. If one of us is busy, we can often move it to another time. Also, the assessments can be ended early, so the time period that may involve our trainee meeting, she should be free for also. Problem: I would note that I'm available during these times, but seeing how little Susie has available since she's not declaring availability in our mutually available times, I have a secondary-lab specific problem. If I say I'm available, more than likely me and the project lead would have to put more groundwork into these assessments and we've been trying to pass those responsibilities on to interns as it takes a lot of time out of our schedules and not really theirs. One intern has a set schedule whether she's in the lab or not and Susie has more freedom with her schedule to make up 3 hours that she'll be gone doing assessments per week. However, I love this lab and my PI. I don't want to say that I'm not available because Susie did and have this affect how much work will be put onto the leader and my PI, because that's even less fair. &amp;#x200B; Advice: Am I just being bitchy/nosy or is this a valid concern? Susie has also been annoying tf out of me by non-stop talking and being non-stop ego-buffed by her advisor about a paper she's first authoring that she didn't write :/, but that's another reddit complaint post and I'm sure that annoyance has inspired this rant, as well. I'm positive that I can't let my lab down and say I'm unavailable. Do you think if I find a way to mention this within the group (not as a confrontation, more like ""this day isn't great for me because of our trainee meeting, but we can cut the time off early"" she'll get the hint via leadership? I certainly cannot afford to be gone multiple days a week for 3 hour periods at a time and the PI has an even more strict schedule, I know for sure this slowdown of data acquisition wouldn't be fair to her. &amp;#x200B; TL;DR Should I call out an intern in my lab who's likely bullshitting about when she's free to help with our research project? &amp;#x200B; Update to those who helped: I followed advice to only put what I was comfortable with and also included ""maybe"" dates that Susie Cakes did not.

"CS to Biochemistry field switch. I'm a second-year **Computer Science** undergraduate minoring in **Biochemistry**. I'm at a solid European university (it's not unusual to continue to schools such as Oxford, Cambridge, ETH, etc.). But I want to do my Master's in Biochemistry, and am not interested in doing anything programming related after my Bachelor's. That means **pure Biochemistry**, not Bioinformatics or Computational Biology. I'm interested in spending my life as a **Biogerontologist** researching aging. From what I understand, interdisciplinary transitions are frowned upon, especially in Europe. My GPA is weak, and I'm trying to find lab work for the summer to strengthen my application, but unlikely to find anything where I live. Plan A: Get into a top grad school in Europe (I would like to remain in Europe). Plan B: Get into a top grad school in the US.

"Oh, no worries! I just didn’t want you to write an essay with that theme because I knew AOs would think, “Lovely student, but a bit out-of-touch on issues of mental health and student disabilities.” My youngest did address their issue (chronic pain and FND) in an essay, but I recommended that she write about her condition in the “additional information” section of the CA. Their condition needed to be addressed because surgeries, nerve blocks, injections, PT, OT, doctors appointments, and one three-week in-patient program had impacted course rigor and ECs. But we limited that essay to a simple just-the-facts recitation of their condition, subsequent improvement, and negative high school impact. Then, we used the CA essay to highlight another aspect of their life: being a beach bum in a family of aggressive outdoor enthusiasts. It allowed the student to demonstrate humor, perseverance, etc., but also allowed admissions to see the kid as someone who was capable of hiking tall peaks, rafting, kayaking, and mountain biking.

"Tips for Structuring a Thesis / Academic Writing (in Humanities). Hello everyone! I will start my master's degree in spring after taking a break from university for 1,5 years. What I remember from my bachelor's is not feeling confident in my academic writing and essentially never knowing how to go about writing an academic paper. Looking back, I'm surprised my thesis got an acceptable grade, not good but also not horrendous. For my master's, I want to go about this differently though. I'm first gen and as such have no one around me who can teach me. I plan on taking writing courses offered by my university, but I'm still worried about having to write a 70-page thesis starting in less than two years. That seems a lot, my bachelor's thesis was 20 pages (also excluding references, etc.) I'm slowly getting a hang of finding research gaps. Unfortunately, structuring is my biggest issue. I've been told that the goal is to ""tell a story"" - how does one tell a story about customs in medieval East Asia? Not sure, and that's my struggle. I'm in Humanities, specifically Area Studies.

She says she is wearing noise cancelling headphones but they aren't enough and she can't focus on her work. Now, I do acknowledge my keyboard is quite loud. However, she has asked me to use another keyboard while she is working, the issue with that is I don't have another keyboard and I don't really have the money to buy another keyboard. While I don't have a problem with her asking, it feels kinda like she's telling me to change it and expects me to just deal with it.

"my ta has a crush on me and won’t stop asking me out for coffee. I (20,f) am studying a very niche specialty of law at my university as an undergraduate, so most if not all of my professors are men, older, and have little to no problem making passes at me but i’ve never had anyone go this far before. I’m in a class with a discussion section and obviously the ta is our grader. we have discussion posts on canvas but they are only worth 0.5 points each so i’ve missed a lot of them but still have a perfect 100% in the class. to give context, i am a very active participant in class and am taking a course on a subject that i know very well so i stand out in the class. last month or so my ta emailed me first to say that he really enjoys having me in his class and that my other professors are lucky to have me in their classes. then he offered to write me letters of recommendation, which was kind of strange because i’m a sophomore and won’t need rec letters until senior year when i’m applying for law school, also i have never mentioned anything about wanting letters of rec. i thanked him and asked to meet during his office hours, and he replied saying he could meet for coffee off campus pretty much whenever i can fit it into my schedule. i thought it was weird but forgot about it and never responded. now we are three weeks from the end of the year, working on a cumulative research project. i asked for him to give feedback on my rough draft during office hours and he again mentioned going off campus for coffee after class. i responded i couldn’t because i have another class after, and again asked about if he has scheduled office hours, even offered to go to the law school building on the other side of campus to make it easier. he just replied saying we should go somewhere else for coffee. he also offered to do a round of revisions and rec letters. i googled him and found out he’s getting married in less than three weeks. what do i do? do i go off campus for coffee with my ta? i don’t really want to but i feel very pressured. i don’t have any intentions of getting with a soon to be married man, but now it feels like he’s expecting me to do something in exchange for the grade i have in his class. i’m worried if i say something about it to the main professor he will start grading me harshly in retaliation. i really don’t feel comfortable going to the university yet because i don’t want to subject myself to the scrutiny and process. is this considered sexual harassment? btw he is probably in his early 30s. he has two degrees already and is pursuing a phd",Faculty,High,2.0,web:pullpush:r/college:submission:harassment,High,2,2586,499,6,my ta has a crush on me and won’t stop asking me out for coffee.,0

It also SEEMS like most of the professors are aware of this and so what on earth is the benefit to group projects in this setting? Most of us are in different time zones, travel often for work, have families etc and so the coordination for these projects is so brutally impractical considering most of us have to do this all the time in our careers already that it drives everyone nuts understandably. I get the merit of a group project for people just out of undergrad but for a highly specific grad school program where you are primarily dealing with professionals who already know how to work as a team/project manage, what’s the point?

Uni­ver­sity re­search de­pends on fed­eral money—11% of Har­vard’s op­er­at­ing rev­enue comes from such grants. But there could be a win-win here for aca­d­e­mics and Re­pub­li­cans. A sig­nif­i­cant across-the-board cut could im­peril re­search. Akin to a ser­vice fee, in­di­rect costs are tacked onto grants to cover the ba­sic costs of con­duct­ing re­search. Be­cause those costs range across in­sti­tu-tions, so did what the gov­ern­ment pro­vided up un­til the rule change. Har­vard, for in­stance, ne­go­ti­ated a higher in­di­rect rate of 69% while many in­sti­tu­tions in lower-cost ar­eas ne­go­ti­ated lower rates. The blan­ket 15% rule ig­nores any in­di­vid­u­al-ized con­sid­er­a­tions, leav­ing schools with higher costs in the lurch. Though courts have tem­porarily blocked part of the change, the is­sue will likely head to Con­gress—where the in­creas­ingly po­lar­iz­ing na­ture of uni­ver­si­ties will be im­por­tant. Ac­cord­ing to a 2024 Gallup poll, the share of Amer­i­cans who have a “great deal” or “quite a lot” of con­fi­dence in uni­ver­si­ties has plunged 20 points in the last 10 years, with the sharpest de­cline among Re­pub­li­cans, down more than 30 points. But blunt poli­cies won’t solve the is­sues dri­ving this de­cline in con­fi­dence. Many aca­d­e­mics ad­mit that the num­ber of non­fac­ulty staff has grown to un­com­fort­able lev­els. A re­cent re­port showed that Stan­ford has roughly one ad­min­is­tra­tor for every stu­dent—an un­flat­ter­ing sta­tis­tic that calls into ques­tion higher ed’s pri­or­i­ties. But ad­min­is­tra­tors have pro­lif­er­ated in part be­cause of gov­ern­ment re­quire­ments that won’t dis­ap­pear with a fund­ing cap. Uni­ver­si­ties re­ceiv­ing grants, for in­stance, must com­ply with im­por­tant but costly reg­u­la­tions to pro­tect the safety of hu­man sub­jects as well as data pri­vacy. On the other side of the bal­ance sheet, cut­ting uni­ver­sity fund­ing af­fects more than aca­d­e­mics. Re­search in­sti­tu­tions can be lo­cal eco­nomic en­gines, cre­at­ing jobs and dri­ving in­no­va­tion. The Uni­ver­sity of Al­abama, the state’s largest em­ployer, re­ceived $334 mil­lion in NIH funds in 2024 alone. Cap­ping in­di­rect costs at 15% would cost it around $70 mil­lion a year, shrink­ing its eco­nomic foot­print. There’s a bet­ter so­lu­tion than a blan­ket cap. Uni­ver­si­ties could in­stead com­mit to ad­dress­ing ad­min­is­tra­tive bloat and shoring up re­search in­tegrity—both rea­son­able points that aca­d­e­mics them­selves have flagged. Given the choice, many re­searchers would rather see more money flow to ac­tual re­search than ad­min­is­tra­tion. And adopt­ing repli­ca­tion poli­cies for re­search find­ings, al­ready stan­dard in many top aca­d­e­mic jour­nals, would bol­ster in­tegrity. In­di­rect cost rates of 70% are likely a thing of the past, but smart ma­neu­ver­ing could give uni­ver­si­ties a win, hand Re­pub­li­cans a vic­tory, and keep vi­tal re­search on solid foot­ing.

"Is my professor being unreasonable or am I. 80 calculus problems during break and a quiz on thanksgiving day? I just want to know if I am being unreasonable. My calculus II professor assigned the following homework assignments (it’s also worth mentioning that the majority of these questions will have multiple parts): - 14 questions due the Wednesday before thanksgiving - a 2 question quiz due on thanksgiving day - 28 questions due the Friday after thanksgiving - 38 questions due Saturday after thanksgiving Coming to a total of 82 calculus problems, many with multiple parts in a five day span while we are on thanksgiving break. So here is where I’m wondering if I’m the one being unreasonable. I emailed my professor and asked if there was any way he could push the due dates for the questions due on Friday and Saturday to Sunday or Monday because my parents are visiting me at my college and we are going to a basketball game on Friday and a football game on Saturday (my dad is obsessed with my college’s sports lol). I know sports are a lousy excuse to not to homework but I’m always in class, I’m a straight A student, and this is something that is really important to my dad so I didn’t think it was unfair to ask. I also thought this was a reasonable ask because we don’t meet again until that Tuesday and the homework’s are graded automatically so the professor doesn’t have to grade them himself. However he sent me this email (pictured) in response to my extension request at 1:52 AM on thanksgiving day which is making me wonder if I’m being unreasonable and not taking my studies seriously enough or if he is just uptight. I guess I just don’t understand what difference it makes if the work is due on Friday and Saturday vs Sunday or Monday if both are before our next class.

"I filed a complaint against my professor for being late. So I don't know if this seems petty or not but I've just gotten to the point to where I'm tired of putting up with this sort of thing. I have an early morning class that my professor has consistently showed up late for. On average it's around the 10 minute mark, the other day it was 20 minutes and the whole class was ready to just walk out. Many students were verbally frustrated about this. If the professor was late once in a blue moon? Yeah big deal, life happens. But *every time*? Also the professor does not even email us to let us know if they're going to be late, they just walk in late and basically don't acknowledge it. Here's the kicker: the same professor grades *us* on attendance and we get marked against if we aren't there. I'm tired of all of these double standards. Majority of the students in the class take the time to wake up early, possible commute like myself, and we all show up on time, so why can't the professor do the same? To me it feels disrespectful. We all *pay* so much money for being here, and we're basically paying for a lesser experience. If I showed up late to work every day I would be fired. I'm not saying that that needs to happen, but at the very least I feel like faculty should be aware of it if they don't know that it's going on. It's funny how students have all of these expectations on them. Even in high school, waking up at 6am is ""preparing you for the real world"". But the system is so broken sometimes and people just get away with things all the time. I filed a complaint but it's hard to say if anything will even be done about this.

"So, am I just lost or is there really no structure in graduate school. When I was in undergrad (online) there were deadlines and schedules. You read this chapter this week, you need to know this material for this paper due this day, you need to listen to this lecture and take a quiz on this day, etc. For me, my process was ignore school Monday through Friday and hunker down and complete everything Saturday and Sunday. I was never behind and always knew exactly what I needed to do to be successful in the class (knew what material I needed for tests and papers and what not). I am in my second week of graduate school and there is nothing. In Blackboard it’s simply lectures listed “module __” that’s about an hour to two hours long. Nowhere in the lecture does it talk about where the information is in the textbooks (2 books for each class). There are no due dates, except for midterm due __ date and final due ___ date. Nothing in the lectures talks about what’s on the two tests and there are no accompanying study guides. It’s just, here’s some lectures, here’s your books, good luck. I’m taking two classes and both classes are set up like this. I tried to create a schedule for listening to the lectures and doing the reading but each class has 15+ hours of lectures to listen to before March. I’m assuming I need to read the first half of both textbooks, which is about 1000-2000 pages of reading per class. And it’s not easy material, it’s super in depth and detailed and a lot to process. I feel like if I knew what material was more important for the tests then I would be able to save some time, by not focusing on harder subject matter that wasn’t needed. I wish I could say this was a poorly designed program issue but I’m attending a school ranked #1 for this program!

"Thoughts on posting review history as part of preprint. Unfortunately, publications in journals are still the ""currency"" in many academic fields. I do research in bioinformatics, so usually revisions on a manuscript in response to reviewers are expected and done fairly quickly, unless something will take a lot of computer time. A thing we've been seeing with more and more manuscripts, is we will get a ""conditional acceptance"", where there are some minor issues with the manuscript that are easily addressed, we revise and resubmit with our responses to the reviewers, and then the manuscript just sits, for weeks and months, with no explanation from the associate editor handling the submission. We also regularly post our manuscripts as preprints, and of course try to update the preprint when we revise and resubmit the manuscript. We are considering making it a policy in our lab that we attach the dates of submission, revisions, decisions, the editor decision, reviewer comments, and responses to them as an addendum to updated preprints, similar to how we include supplemental documents in preprints. Obvious potential disadvantages I can see are: * Open review is not the norm, and this is making the reviews on manuscripts public, with no chance for reviewers to opt out. * Editors may start blacklisting us from submitting manuscripts and desk reject the manuscripts from us, which we would then add to the preprint addendum. I know F1000 Research essentially does this, but that is known from the start that this is going to happen by submitting a manuscript to them, and by reviewers agreeing to review. Peer Community In (PCI) looks like another effort of going down this road, and the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS) the reviews are done in public on GitHub. I'm interested in knowing if anyone else has tried something like this as a policy, and other potential disadvantages I haven't thought about. Are we expecting too much when we don't hear from the journal after a revision (journal policies often seem to place tight deadlines on the submission of a revision unless one requests an extension, it seems weird that they take forever to respond to the revision). Alternatively, are there other journal / publisher communities where the review of manuscripts is essentially done in the open (besides PCI, F1000, JOSS)?",Lab,High,2.0,web:pullpush:r/academia:submission:issue,High,2,2346,386,12,Thoughts on posting review history as part of preprint.,0

"Is it worth having another job in the semester. In January starts my fourth semester at the university (I am not in Mainland). I stay in an apartment near the university with housemates, I pay for it, my father used to help me some months with half but I don't expect anything anymore because he has retired. I am part of the work-study program and I work in the library of my university, I like it, but the problem is that they pay monthly. Other than that, I haven't worked at anything else and my income is based on that and the pell grant. I pay for my housing with a savings account that I accumulated since high school specifically for my housing. The thing is that I've been thinking about working at some fast food part time this semester to save some money since I don't want to survive only on my savings and the fact that I get paid monthly makes it difficult to pay some bills, but I don't know if it's worth it to have two jobs (since I don't plan on quitting school and work), since I've never done anything like that and I don't know how the balance would be, although next semester I'll only have 16 credits. There is also the factor of my family, my parents are very old and I wish I could be with it longer (I usually go down some weekends -3hrs ride-, but if I start working I most likely won't be able to do that) and my boyfriend who is in our hometown.

"How to approach the ""I'm 99% sure you used AI for these assignments"" conversation. The TA for my Abnormal Psychology class reached out recently about a student's short writing exercises that look fucky. I agree with him; the writing is weirdly formal, has excessive adjectives, and does the thing with bolded headings before bullet points that screams LLM to me. I dropped the three responses into a detector and it popped out &gt;90% probability of AI. I emailed the student to ask to meet about her recent assignments, and she agreed to meet tomorrow. During that meeting, what do I say? I've had students look me in the eye and deny everything in the face of stronger proof than this. I've had a student file a complaint (thankfully dismissed) against me after a conversation that went approximately: &gt;Me: This response isn't at all like your other work. \[shows samples\] &gt;Student: I have no idea what you're talking about. &gt;Me: This, this, and this are in line with the way ChatGPT formats responses. &gt;Student: I had no idea ChatGPT did it that way when I chose to format my response like that. &gt;Me: Okay, in that case please just explain your response to me. &gt;Student: I'd have to see it. &gt;Me: The prompt was \[repeats prompt\]. Why did you write what you did? &gt;Student: I don't remember. &gt;Me: That's a problem, that you don't remember.

"Thank you for your insight; that makes sense. As I mentioned in one of my posts, I have taken on extra work without complaints for over five years, even though I knew it extended beyond my assigned work hours and was not equitably distributed. However, what I found particularly problematic this time was that additional responsibilities were assigned solely to me without consideration of my availability, while others on the same team were given the option to participate based on their schedules. When I raised concerns about fairness, the department chair threatened me not to bring up the notion of fairness. I believe, in a healthy academic environment, faculty should feel empowered to raise concerns about equity and fairness without fear of criticism. Decisions regarding workload and responsibilities should be made transparently, with opportunities for open discussion and feedback, and communication should be clear and consistent across all campuses and faculty members. I don’t mind coming to campus on extra days, and I haven’t complained about being assigned the earliest classes starting at 8 a.m., which requires me to wake up at 3 a.m., pack a lunchbox for my little one, and leave the house around 5 a.m. to get to campus on time. However, my concern is that my attempts to discuss transparency and fairness regarding this work were intentionally dismissed and silenced by the chair. Thank you all for your advice.

"My professor is limiting my education and I need advice on how to talk to her department chair. I (21 f) am currently a senior in college majoring in elementary education with a 4.0 GPA. I’ve had tough professors before where I’ve struggled in the class but I’ve always made it through. This semester, I’m taking a science class where we’re supposed to learn how to teach science to elementary schoolers and the professor is absolutely awful. She has a 1 star rating on rate my professor and even though we just finished week 10, we still haven’t actually learned how to teach science. At the beginning of the semester, she said if we had an issue with her, we needed to talk to her about it instead of leaving it in the end of the semester survey for her boss to see. This professor’s lectures are all over the place, she’s rude to her students, and her assignments don’t make sense. Multiple people in my class have tried to ask her questions but she never answers them. She also has multiple spelling errors with everything she posts. One of her Canvas announcements said “See you in see you next in person class in person next class”. I’ve gone to her office hours before to try and have some of the materials clarified and she went on a rant about tariffs? She also talks over literally everyone in my class and doesn’t give us much time to ask questions. Two weeks ago, I completed an assignment that took me 4 hours to complete. First, the template she gave us lit up red in the document from all of the spelling errors that Grammarly recognized. Then, the instructions were confusing and unclear. She also told our class very last minute that we could receive 10 points of extra credit if we worked with a partner on the assignment (we had to take pictures together for it so it would have had to have been in person). Because of how last minute it was, I wasn’t able to get a partner, plus I live farther away than my classmates. I emailed her asking if there was anything else I could do for extra credit and she said no because extra credit is optional. Other people in my class were having the same issue as me, so I responded and explained that it wasn’t accessible for me or others to do. She never responded to that email. The assignment was graded today and I received a B on it, which I know isn’t a bad grade, but because of how heavily it’s weighted, my overall grade dropped 8 points from an A to a B. She doesn’t have a rubric for the assignment posted, but she did leave comments on the assignment with very short feedback. For example, one was “You needed a citation for this. -5 points”. But for that, the wording was my own and I didn’t use another source, plus that part of the assignment didn’t say anything about needing a source like other parts of the assignment did. I really feel like I did this assignment correctly according to the directions, but when I’ve asked questions about past assignments she hasn’t responded. She’s the only professor who teaches this class and I’m at a point I think I need to go to the department chair and tell them what’s going on. I think this professor is tenured, but this is the only science course required for my degree and I feel like I’m extremely unprepared to teach science once I graduate. If I talk to the department chair, what exactly would I need to say? I don’t want to come across as rude or as a student who just can’t handle a mediocre grade (although I’m upset about the grading). How do I handle this situation? I’ve tried talking to this professor before and it hasn’t worked and it’s at the point it’s affecting my grade.

"How would you feel if colleges added requirements for you to apply and be considered. I see a lot of people saying that the acceptance rate for Oxbridge is higher than many ivies and T10s in general - but they really need to stop comparing two different systems. In the UK, they literally tell you that you need AAA in your A Levels to even be considered, so the people that are applying are people who meet that criteria or get better grades - so a little less shotgunning and more serious, realistic consideration of where they should apply to. But really, imagine if universities in the US said that you are required to have 1500 SAT or higher, a certain score on your APs or a particular GPA. Yall would riot. As much as people may disagree, I personally feel that leaving applications open to everyone to evaluate their profile on an individual basis is very lenient. (Forgive me if any university already has a set of requirements that I don't know of) Edit: I see some people are kinda confused on why I mentioned colleges would set requirements on AP, since they are not as wide spread as A Levels in the UK. I am not very aware of your high school cirriculum, I was just giving a general example for you to visualise how setting standards would increase acceptance rates relative to the number of applications.

"Seeking advice on gaining research experience starting from a non-traditional background. Hello. I hope this post is allowed here. If not, I'll take it down of course. Anyway: I'm 28 and interested in developing a career in academic research, and I'm interested in studying neuropsychology, and evolutionary neuropsychology more specifically. To this end, I'm currently trying to build up a background that will allow me to be competitive in applying to grad school. I do have an undergraduate degree, but it is in a completely unrelated field in the arts. The only possible applicable skills I have from this degree are some codding skills and some training with data processing skills via python, excel, SQL, etc. I'm currently taking classes at a local community college to build up a background that better fits my desired career path. I will likely push forward with this until I can get an associates in biology. I don't have any applicable job experience currently; my background is being a barista and doing freelance visual art. I know that research experience is the most important part of grad school applications. I feel a bit lost on how I can get that experience given where I'm starting from. After a few weeks of crawling the web, talking with a professor at my college, and emailing around, I did manage to find one spot for a volunteer role for 4 to 8 hours a week helping a program at a local research hospital. Though the program's topic of study has nothing to do with neuroscience (it deals with studying lung diseases) and the role would mostly involve reviewing health records to screen for potential participants, with some possibility for getting more involved if the opportunity/chance comes along. I don't know if I should accept this opportunity or not. On the one hand, it's very separated from my desired subject. But on the other hand, should I take any experience I can get while I'm still taking classes? Does anybody who's maybe been in my shoes have any advice on how to navigate here? What might be some other avenues for getting started with neuroscientific research?

"Feeling Constantly Overwhelmed. Hey all - first semester of my grad program… it’s been an emotional roller coaster. Some days, I’m like, “YAY grad school!” And other days, “Why the hell did I choose to do this!” From what I’ve gathered, these feelings seem to be normal, and I knew grad school wouldn’t be a slice of cake, but I’m really struggling with how disruptive it’s been to my routine. I feel like it’s really affected my mental health. For instance, in undergrad, it was stressful but I still managed my time well enough to go to the gym Mon-Friday, work part time as a waitress, go home once a week to see my grandparents, maybe have a Friday night out dancing, I enjoy cooking and meal prepping … grad school, I’ve been struggling to do all these things that make me HAPPY! I’ve tried being more realistic with myself, saying, okay maybe instead of going to the gym 5 times a week, aim for 2-3, cut down your hours at work, maybe call your grandparents and chat over the phone instead of driving in every week, but it make me feel so guilty, and I’m so upset that I can’t do all these things. I feel like I’m letting myself down, like I’m letting other people down. It seems that when I try to find that balance too, one or two things always goes.

"Advice? I’m losing interest in my degree and falling behind. I’m losing interest in my degree. I’ve been struggling with severe migraines for the last year and it’s caused me to withdrawal from my previous classes. This was the most prominent in the Fall 2023 semester. I had migraines 25/30 days of the month give or take, from late July to December. I’ve since then visited neurology which lessened the amount and potency of the migraines. However, I am still unable to go to classes most days due to not being able to handle the lighting in the rooms and severe nausea. These struggles have led me to some mental health challenges. It became so hard to submit my assignments and keep up with my classes this semester. Since withdrawing from all of my classes last semester, I have added a semester onto my schooling. I now I fear I’m going to have to add another semester, making it an added year in total. I have never done so badly in school in my life, I was the valedictorian at my high school, and I have always been considered “the smart one.” I’m in my 3rd year of studying mechanical engineering. I’m in a sorority (which focuses heavily on academic, not parties), and I’m the only engineering major in the chapter. Everyone always tells me I’m smart, but I don’t feel like it. It’s causing me to feel more and more under pressure. I don’t even know what I want to do with my life anymore. Currently this semester all of my classes I am taking are classes I previously had to withdraw from. I didn’t learn anything when I took the classes the first time, since I was constantly sick. Essentially, the same thing has happened again. I don’t want to retake these classes again for the 3rd time, I feel like I’m a disappointment if I do. At this point, I don’t really think my professors believe me that I’m sick, and to then have to retake the classes again just doesn’t sit well with me. It already looks bad enough that I had to add a semester. To clarify, one of my classes I’m going to fail because the professor is genuinely terrible and multiple people will probably fail purely based on his horrible teaching and grading style. The other class I am going to fail because I did terrible on the 1st exam and then had a panic attack during the 3rd exam and couldn’t complete a single problem. Is it bad if I have to add a whole year to graduate with my degree? No one else in my year has to do it, and they will all know and judge me for it. Also it’s not like I can take summer classes to catch up, since all of my classes are offered in-person only and none in the summer. I feel like everyone is going to judge me. Plus I don’t even know if I like my degree. I’m going into construction management after I graduate, however I want to go into the field with a degree in mechanical engineering. This is because then I can always switch careers and have more options. I also am super passionate about mechanical engineering. Or at least I used to be. I love it, but all of the struggles I’ve been having make it seem worse by the day. I’ve considered switching majors to construction management, but I feel like I’m just taking the easy way out with that. Also, everyone I know expects me to graduate with and engineering degree because “you’re so smart.” I guess I expect it for myself too, so I’m letting myself down as well. I really don’t know how to process all of this. I could really use some advice from people outside of my life.

"You're arguing from an incorrect premise. &gt;The average cost of attendance at an in-state public 4-year school in the US is $27,146/year. This is still prohibitively expensive. The complaint is that college as a whole, for the middle class as a *social stratification* is prohibitively expensive, especially considering how it's essentially a prerequisite for the vast majority of white-collar jobs that were considered safe options (median lifetime earnings increasing on the order of 10\^5 with a college degree) for upward mobility. It is not fallacious to say that these should be more affordable. I have colleagues who graduated from ETH Zurich, Tokyo, Tsinghua, and Peking, all of whom I can confidently say spent less than $20k on degrees that are comparable to those earned at prestigious American universities. To use your (for many reasons, awful) analogy, most would consider it unjust for an American dealership to sell a Toyota Corolla for $100k when a German dealership sells bikes, Corollas, and G-Wagens for $20k.

"Do not take mastery-based classes. I’m currently taking Calculus 2 with a professor who uses the mastery based grading system and it is, without a doubt, the most frustrating thing I’ve ever gone through. I took calculus 1 with him and was one “quiz” (he refers to them as short opportunities”) from either failing or getting a B+. The professor grades using the following standards; Novice, Apprentice, Almost Master, and Master. In order to pass you must get two masters on the same topic for over half the topics, aka get two one hundreds on the same quiz. Sounds easy but a class like calculus is incredibly hard to be perfect in. Retakes are plausible but you only get so many. Since the school year started I’ve had insane anxiety about his class and am considering dropping it, the only thing keeping me from doing so is the fact I already withdrew from a class last semester. To me, the system seems unfair and expecting students to get 100% on 20 calculus quizzes seems like a bit much. In his own words, an apprentice is the equivalent of an 75% so why should I fail if I get apprentices?

One thing I am thinking about though is the cost of living and being able to afford living on my own in an apartment while I am in school. There are a ton of internships for people getting their masters but a lot of times they are labeled for students currently enrolled. I also ideally would like to work somewhere that has tuition reimbursement but it's a bit of a chicken and egg situation. I want to find a job or internship that will help me gain experience and help me cover cost of living while I am in school, but I don't necessarily want to apply to a masters program and get accepted until I have a way to make sure I will be able to afford it with a job. Hopefully I explained this clearly. For context, I don't have experience with loans and how this would play a part in this situation because I was blessed to earn a full ride scholarship for undergrad.

"Is it me or my supervisor. Hi all, So I'm doing my thesis and it's my first exposure in the research world. I'm very unsure of what's going on right now and I'm starting to doubt and think if I'm the problem or if my supervisor is the problem. When i found a supervisor it all felt fine so I took it on. The project proposal from the uni was approved. Anyway fast forward, he keeps repeating whenever we meet that my tasks are very simple (data collection and then statistical compilation of what I've found) and I understand that it's simple but it's still my first time. Now suddenly he comes out of nowhere and tells me to do some additional entries that have nothing to do with my thesis. So it's just extra tasks for the sake of helping them but that I won't use for my thesis. I was taken aback and just said ok (being the person who can't say no). I guess that explains why he kept repeating that my thesis was simple, so he could give me extra work? I feel like I am not interested in doing extra work unrelated to my thesis especially since I've grown to realize I don't like the subject but I'm too scared to say anything because I don't want him to think I'm being lazy and affecting my grade. It's not that supervision has been optimal. He's available for meetings and all but he never reads my emails and drafts that I send. I sent a paper to him regarding my findings on methods and he never replied (been a month) so I thought it's been fine but yesterday I en passant mentioned the method and explained what I was planning to do and he said it was wrong. Like that could've been discovered earlier. Anyway I'm not sure of what to expect as it's my first exposure and I'm not sure how to handle this.

"harsh paper review, anxious about reputation as im applying for phd programmes. tldr: harsh paper review, worried they know who i am, anxious it'll mess up my phd applications or reputation in the field. i submitted my undergrad thesis to a journal a few months ago. got one of the highest marks on it at uni, so thought i'd give it a shot. heard back tonight - pretty harsh rejection. i read through the comments and some of them i definitely can see where they're coming from / agree with (i'd acrually already fixed most these things in a revision i had done prior to even receiving the feedback), but some things seem like the reviewer just misinterpreted what i'd said or totally misread it and based their comment off of that. further, some of it felt unnecessarily harsh, about my positionality and perspective on issues at hand (sorry this is vague, not trying to be too specific) especially bc such comments were about something i had Specifically worked with my supervisor about and had had approved prior to even submitting my thesis. the reviewer called my results meaningless, and that i have a ""lack of perspective on my work."" ouch. for context, this was a comment about how i said my results had a x% difference on certain data compared to the study i was replicating, though my sample size was smaller. again, undergrad diss. i will say though i definitely made some dumb mistakes and being more familiar with the literature and field (as well as just academic writing in general) now i definitely see my errors. here is my problem. i know it should be anonymous, but my field is really small, and i linked to my experiment (it was online) in my paper. im realising now that online experiment has my name on it by way of the consent form. im in the phd application process now and im just really anxious that whoever reviewed my paper, and the editors, think im stupid, wont admit me, will tell their colleagues to not admit me. i guess im thinking, since my (broad) thesis topic is what i want to do my phd in, if the thesis is bad, the reviewer must be thinking to not let me continue in the field. probably this is a dumb question, and im overthinking it, but im really anxious and would appreciate some reassurance that ive not fucked everything up, i guess. tia, sorry if this is silly",Faculty,Medium,1.0,web:pullpush:r/academia:submission:problem,Medium,1,2307,417,6,"harsh paper review, anxious about reputation as im applying for phd programmes.",0
"Teachers who use fear and humiliation as teaching tools, how is this still accepted, and how do students heal from it. i’ve been thinking about something from primary school and i’m not sure if i’m overreacting. i had a math teacher who would regularly humiliate me in front of the class because i struggled with math. he would swear at me, curse, and make me stand in front of him while he marked my exam papers. during normal lessons, if i got something wrong, he would scold me harshly in front of everyone. it felt intimidating and degrading. because of that, i developed strong anxiety around math and numbers. even now at 23, when certain memories resurface, i sometimes cry or feel close to a panic attack. i also carry a lot of shame and low confidence from that time. what confuses me is that this teacher often told stories about former students who met him years later and thanked him for being “harsh” because it supposedly helped them succeed. many of my classmates admired him and believed his strictness was for our own good. back then, i even tried to convince myself that i liked him too. now, as an adult, i’m questioning everything. is it actually okay for teachers to use fear, humiliation, and intimidation to “motivate” students? why is this kind of approach so normalized? how are children supposed to grow into confident adults if they’re shamed instead of supported? i’m also wondering whether reaching out to him now to ask about it would be healing or just reopen old wounds. am i being overly dramatic, or is this kind of experience genuinely harmful? i’d really appreciate hearing other perspectives, especially from teachers or people who went through something similar",Examination,Medium,1.0,web:reddit:r/students:new,Medium,1,1699,293,5,"Teachers who use fear and humiliation as teaching tools, how is this still accepted, and how do students heal from it.",0

And now it's finals, instead of the tests being administered as they normally are in class, they're 24 hour period tests that we can use whatever resource we want. Sounds great in theory, but to compensate my professors decided they needed to make the tests harder than they have been in the past years.

"What to do to be a strong applicant (especially after being on disability). Open to both specific and broad advice, planning to go for an environmental chem/eng PhD. I planned to take a year or two to work after undergrad before going to grad school, but during that time period I ended up with a traumatic brain injury that took me out of work for 2ish years. My resume graduating college was pretty good, I was at a state school (not super competitive, but R1) and did an NSF REU, 3 years in a lab in my field, and was a part of a national scholars group. I think my GPA was a 3.7-3.8. I presented a couple different research projects at conferences, but the TBI happened before I could get my thesis published. I had to take the time off work, too. I feel like I'm finally back on my feet, and really want to apply to grad school for the next cycle, but I'm kinda worried that 1. being on disability for 2 years means I will have a gap in my resume to explain, and I know it's illegal to discriminate but that doesn't stop plenty of places, and 2. I kind of lost touch with all the contacts I had at my university (including my research group). I know I should have messaged earlier but god, brain injury rehab is a hell I don't wish on anyone and it kept falling to the wayside. I'm worried about letters of rec, and worried that it's too late to message people now.

"Is all I've done in life plagiarism. **Hello everyone,** I’m feeling extremely down at the moment because a thought that’s been lingering just won’t leave me alone. Not long ago, I wrote a mini-thesis for my first year of my master’s. It was graded very well, and I was proud of it. But thinking back now, not only about that thesis but also about much of my work during university—dissertations, papers, etc.—I’ve started to wonder: is this really *my* work? Let me explain how I wrote my mini-thesis. The first thing I did, as I usually do, was to see if anyone had already written on my topic. I also Googled it and gathered useful, closely related information from various sites. I read everything carefully. When it came time to write, I would take different parts from other people’s theses, keep the good parts, and combine them into new paragraphs. I cited and referenced the authors properly. I also added information I found online that fit with the “new” paragraphs I was creating. Sometimes, I worked the other way around: I would find information online, use only parts of sentences, and mix them with other pieces I found elsewhere. I didn’t always cite sources if the information seemed obvious or widely known—for example, summaries of judgments that hundreds of sites described the same way, or things I had already learned in class. The problem is, in hindsight, it feels like I didn’t actually *create* anything. My thesis was essentially a collection of bits of information from other people’s work, carefully merged and linked, sometimes compared, sometimes just combined. There was very little truly original thought. It ended up being a thesis full of references, for example: “Something something (1), according to M.M., something is (2). Indeed, M.S. adds that (3). The concept also creates a dangerous precedent for (4).” You see what I mean? It’s a realization that even though I worked hard, most of the “work” was about organizing and mixing other people’s ideas rather than producing something that came directly from me. Please help me understand, is this normal to feel this way?

"Bad professor - no sympathy. i’m just curious to know what other people think about the situation that I’m in right now. A professor that I have assigned work at a monthly basis where it’s due at the end of every month. I had worked the entire month on a project and when I went to submit it to the schools website, it failed numerous times so sure on the syllabus it says late assignments will not be accepted, and then on the assignment itself it says it must be turned into that webpage. I had emailed it to her and explained to her my issue as it took me up until the last day to complete the work along with my other classwork that I had to do so I unfortunately had no time to reach out to IT for any help and I almost figured that emailing her the assignment the day before would not consider a late assignment. I get an email from her today, one week after I sent the assignment out and she sits there and tries to claim that I will get a zero and since it was not uploaded to the website, it’s a zero no matter what. So here’s where I need someone’s thoughts and advice does it seem almost like it’s a little bit rude and inconsiderate to give me a zero not even looking at my work just because I didn’t submit it to that website because it was out of my hand and I just couldn’t get it to work no matter how hard I tried. Personally if I was a pro professor, I’d be happy that my student had reached out to me a different way and actually did the work and wasn’t trying to avoid it. I did the work, turned it in the day before and just because it wasn’t on the website it’s a zero… What could I do about this?

"OP, you have probably been in academia a long time. You have seen good professors fired. You’ve seen injustices. You take a lot of pride in your work and your ethics. Getting a write up, a slap on the wrist, fired, PIP, etc does not diminish who you are and what you’ve done. They’d like to think it does and that they are covering their bases, but in the end no matter what they throw at you, you are still hirable. Work your wage and work on what benefits you outside the university. If they show no loyalty to you, then that is fine. You have years to get your ducks in a row to earn royalties, commissions, and getting paid for speaking. You have years to build up your contacts and use them to your advantage. The university thinks they are putting you in your place and making an example of you, but really they are giving you the push you need to fly. You can get your priorities in order. And let me tell you, good ratings and reviews are not the hallmark of an awesome professor. When you’re on your deathbed you won’t remember what any of those reviews said or what your rating was. You won’t even remember this BS with the student or what their name is. Getting a mark against you can be taken as a badge of honor sometimes if you use it right. Think of workers contacting OSHA or labor review boards and getting retaliated against. They leave the job appreciated by their peers and those after them if things change. Your chair and union rep should fight the write up and the policy that they make these decisions without conferring with the professor and getting everyone on board before telling the student what will be done. There will be more of these situations in the future and by them completely bypassing the professor- the student may gain unfair advantages beyond what the accommodations seek to give. The student is then expectant of these unfair advantages. While we all know that schools and universities no longer care if ill prepared students are a blemish on their reputation, you still care about your reputation. Sadly, your reputation is being eroded no matter what you do. As expectations get lowered, accommodations grow, and lawsuits flourish- your name (no matter how good it was) will be tossed in to the same barrel as those who went with the flow and passed anyone and everyone. Don’t wreck your retirement and life over this one grade grubber. That is all that they are in the end. We all know that if this kid can’t get it together to cope with an ungraded assignment, then their future won’t be so bright and shiny. If you’re going to throw your career away and force yourself to work longer - do it for someone meaningful. You get one life. The reviews don’t matter. The ratings don’t matter. A perfect file doesn’t matter. You get to decide what your legacy is and what your reputation is. If you build it up by not being so attached to your university- even better! So when you start working on your textbook, seminars, curriculum, or whatever- you can show your university no loyalty. No mentions. No freebies. No collaborations. They can claim your brilliance all they want- but you don’t have to owe any credit to them. If they want you to speak, they can pay you. If they want you to consult. They can pay you. This university can be a stepping stone to your true life’s work. All this situation did is reveal it’s time to start now. So don’t quit your job and let pride and anger get you off course. Use it as your rocket fuel for where you’re supposed to go. Once you get your ducks in a row and your retirement in better standing, flip them the bird on your way out to bigger and better things.

"NEWS 26 October 2021 Giant, free index to world’s research papers released online Catalogue of billions of phrases from 107 million papers could ease computerized searching of the literature. Holly Else Carl Malamud Technologist Carl Malamud.Credit: Smita Sharma In a project that could unlock the world’s research papers for easier computerized analysis, an American technologist has released online a gigantic index of the words and short phrases contained in more than 100 million journal articles — including many paywalled papers. The catalogue, which was released on 7 October and is free to use, holds tables of more than 355 billion words and sentence fragments listed next to the articles in which they appear. It is an effort to help scientists use software to glean insights from published work even if they have no legal access to the underlying papers, says its creator, Carl Malamud. He released the files under the auspices of Public Resource, a non-profit corporation in Sebastopol, California, that he founded. Malamud says that because his index doesn’t contain the full text of articles, but only sentence snippets up to five words long, releasing it does not breach publishers’ copyright restrictions on the reuse of paywalled articles. However, one legal expert says that publishers might question the legality of how Malamud created the index in the first place. Some researchers who have had early access to the index say it’s a major development in helping them to search the literature with software — a procedure known as text mining. Gitanjali Yadav, a computational biologist at the University of Cambridge, UK, who studies volatile organic compounds emitted by plants, says she aims to comb through Malamud’s index to produce analyses of the plant chemicals described in the world’s research papers. “There is no way for me — or anyone else — to experimentally analyse or measure the chemical fingerprint of each and every plant species on Earth. Much of the information we seek already exists, in published literature,” she says. But researchers are restricted by lack of access to many papers, Yadav adds. Malamud’s General Index, as he calls it, aims to address the problems faced by researchers such as Yadav. Computer scientists already text mine papers to build databases of genes, drugs and chemicals found in the literature, and to explore papers’ content faster than a human could read. But they often note that publishers ultimately control the speed and scope of their work, and that scientists are restricted to mining only open-access papers, or those articles they (or their institutions) have subscriptions to. Some publishers have said that researchers looking to mine the text of paywalled papers need their authorization. And although free search engines such as Google Scholar have — with publishers’ agreement — indexed the text of paywalled literature, they only allow users to search with certain types of text queries, and restrict automated searching. That doesn’t allow large-scale computerized analysis using more specialized searches, Malamud says. Terabytes of data Malamud’s project is his latest venture in a career spent releasing locked-up information for free access online — often in the face of legal challenges. He originally focused on publishing government-produced legal and financial information. But more recently he has turned his attention to opening up the scientific literature. He began with a project to allow scientists to text mine — but not read — a giant store of research papers he’s holding on a server in India; an idea he says he’s still working on. The General Index now allows anyone to mine scientific works, but it doesn’t have its own web-search portal, so if scientists want to search it, they will have to download its files and develop their own programs. Malamud is hoping that users will make any search engines they create available to others. In its compressed format, the catalogue totals almost 5 terabytes, and then expands to 38 terabytes. As well as sentence fragments, the files also include tables of nearly 20 billion keywords in the literature, and tables of a paper’s title, authors and DOI (article identifier), so that users can track down a full paper if they have access to read it. Michael Carroll, a legal researcher at the American University Washington College of Law in Washington DC, says that distributing the index should be legal worldwide because the files do not copy enough of an underlying article to infringe the publisher’s copyright — although laws vary by country. “Copyright does not protect facts and ideas, and these results would be treated as communication of facts derived from the analysis of the copyrighted articles,” he says. The only legal question, Carroll adds, is whether Malamud’s obtaining and copying of the underlying papers was done without breaching publishers’ terms. Malamud says that he did have to get copies of the 107 million articles referenced in the index to create it; he declined to say how, but emphasizes that researchers will not have access to the full texts of the papers, which are stored in a secured, undisclosed location in the United States. “I am very confident that what I’m doing is legal. We are not doing this to provoke a lawsuit, we are doing it to advance science,” he says. Nature contacted six publishers about the General Index for this article: all but one declined to comment. In a statement, Springer Nature said that the company supports open-research initiatives that use technology and algorithms to meet the needs of researchers. “We have seen some initiatives run into trouble, however, when the necessary rights have not been secured to enable their sustainability,” the statement added. (Springer Nature publishes this journal; Nature’s news team is editorially independent of its publisher.) Another legal researcher, Arul George Scaria at Delhi’s National Law University, says that any publishers that tried to use copyright laws to prevent researchers from using the General Index “would eventually be disappointed”. The release of the index, Scaria says, is a “major development for the wealth of information it has unlocked from those 107 million journal articles”. doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-021-02895-8",Faculty,Medium,1.0,web:pullpush:r/academia:comment:portal not working,Medium,1,6307,1009,6,"NEWS 26 October 2021 Giant, free index to world’s research papers released online Catalogue of billions of phrases from 107 million papers could ease computerized searching of the literature.",0

"Do master’s degrees typically get funded? Is it worth it to pay tuition for job security. Hello! For quick context, I am going into computer science programs. I absolutely want to go to grad school, I cannot get talked out of it. I have been graduated from undergrad for a year and only worked shitty minimum wage jobs because no one will hire me. However, I’ve had many professors and others with master’s degrees tell me NOT to go to grad school unless it’s fully funded. I fortunately got into my top school! But they said they are giving me $30,000 a year for 2 years, and after that tuition scholarship, I’d still have around $60,000 in student loan debt. Without that scholarship, I’d be at around $120,000 for two years of grad school. For more context, this school has a 100% placement rate before graduating and guaranteed internships during school. I’ve gone down a rabbit hole of alumni of this school and every single person I found has had a job at a major company working in the UX field (I found random alumni LinkedIn accounts so it’s not this school sharing propaganda) I’m in a pickle. To me, the networking and job security is absolutely worth the trade off. I’ll be in a big city with tons of opportunities. I am fortunate enough to not have any undergrad student loans, so my only debt would be from grad school. I’d start off in a job making more per year than I’d have in loans. These other schools do not have this amount of opportunity, job placement, and networking opportunities. Students aren’t guaranteed jobs after. My question is, should I do it?

"This is an automated service intended to preserve the original text of the post. *I (21f) made a post worried about an honest end of course evaluation I gave my professor. I thought the evaluation was going to be sent to my professor’s bosses but learned it was instead going to him instead. The class I took was a coding class, and I am a math education major for middle and high school. During the semester, the professor didn’t know the coding language he was teaching (this was his first time teaching the class but also pushed to make this class required in my degree as he was the former department chair of my degree), and assigned chapters to read for the coding textbook so we could teach ourselves since he never taught anything himself in class because he barely knew the content. The assignments were straight from the textbook but he modified them to make them harder and constantly had to say “I don’t know the answer to your question but I’ll ask my colleague”. My problem is that he had no problem assigning tough assignments then giving us bad grades and would ignore my emails asking questions (likely because he could not answer them). So, in the evaluation I was brutally honest and made it completely clear I thought the way he “taught” the semester was unacceptable. I did not call him names but I gave specific examples of issues I had problems with from class regarding him not really teaching us and only assigning textbook readings, him needing to be more educated on the content things of that nature. I said it professionally, but again I was honest. I believe if you don’t know what you’re teaching, you shouldn’t be teaching the class because his excuse to not knowing anything was “it’s my first time teaching this, I don’t know the content” but he was the pushing to make the class required for my degree in the first place. In my last post I said I was worried my professor will see the evaluation and know it’s me because I have to take him again. I didn’t go into the details of the awful semester I had to endure in my last post but the amount of grown adults who are professors in the community that were quick to assume I was being an awful student giving an unfair review was absolutely terrible. One person said “well you’re worried about him seeing but thought his bosses would,” blaming me for the situation when I want his bosses to know because it’s unfair that I pay expensive tuition to have a professor say I don’t know the content then assign me tough assignments that he can’t complete himself. I’m not even kidding, he assigned a coding assignment that had thousands of rows of uncleaned data that wouldn’t work for the assignment we had to do, creating a model for the dataset with 12+ steps while the other students and me were panicking. Then, he came to class and said he got stuck on step 3 and quit trying to complete the assignment. Not to mention, the in class coding assignments he would get stuck on frequently and the whole class would not know how to continue. I wouldn’t care if he saw the evaluation if I knew I wouldn’t have to take him again but my degree has limited teachers and he’s unfair, having unrealistic expectations for students and admitting he’s lazy (he graded 1 assignment in October out of about 25 and that’s about all the grades he put in till the end of November, admitting he’s just not doing it) and doesn’t know the content he is teaching. Just upset that professors I don’t even know from Reddit are quick to blame me when they don’t know the situation I went through. I have respect for most professors but seeing the mentality they have for students is sickening to me. If it’s a bad evaluation that was harsh, he was harsh and unfair the entire semester making me stress while being rude about it half the time. If you didn’t know anything even though HE didn’t know it either, he would basically say well you need to know it (and essentially, figure it out yourself). * *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

"Lab TA doesn't have Lab I remember doing. Hi, wondering if I can do anything. I have Lab grades missing which I remember doing and are also missing from my grades. I've tried contacting the people I thought could help with no luck. I have ADHD and I missed some lab sessions and went to other ones. This is no excuse but I had been asking the Lab TAs if this was allowed the entire time. My first 4 lab grades and attendance are missing, and I remember being in these labs. I even have emails of asking permission. The first two were in the other session, but the next two were in the correct session. I need this grade to pass. I contacted my professor and he seemed annoyed that I had been using other lab sessions. However I am missing labs from my correct lab session as well, and the other Lab ta said he had given original lab ta my labs. I'm hoping that the professor believes me and gives me full credit for these labs. They aren't harshly graded assignments and if you do work you usually get between 95 and 100, even if you didn't finish during class time. Anything I can do? If he decides to just give the grade that's great, but if not should I contact anyone higher? I've already contacted both TAs relevant and the Professor so idk what to do.

"Letter of Rec Reminder Etiquette. I'm currently applying to grad school, and one of my application deadlines is coming up on the 31st. I only needed one reference, and the professor I chose has been very good about correspondence. I initially reached out at the end of January to give her plenty of time to write a good letter. I sent her everything she requested right away, excluding my final personal statement, which I sent by the first of March. I reached out two weeks ago to confirm that she had received the submission email from the university, and she replied that she had, and not to worry, that she would have my letter in by the 31st. The 31st is in three days, and my anxiety is in full swing (just because that's who I am as a person). My letter has not yet been received by the university. Would it be rude to send one last 48 hour reminder email? And if not, what would be a good way of wording it? We've always had a great rapport, but I'm afraid of coming off as overbearing. In my head, I'm aware that an average of one email every two weeks probably isn't—especially when the only other email that might be interpreted as a reminder was the one confirming if she had received the submission email. EDIT: This was my reminder email: Hi X, I hope things are going well for you—at the very least, that you’ve been able to enjoy some quality time with your family at home! Given that everything is so hectic right now, I just wanted to send a last 48 hour reminder that the letter for XXX is due by Tues at 7pm EST.

"&gt;I could add a trigger warning in every single post that I suffer from OCD and panic disorder. You could, but it's apparent just by reading your post. Let me approach your issue this way: At the most basic level, to live a life with at least a minimum of comfort and safety. Comfort and safety both require money. For some, that money is inherited. Other get that money from luck. But for most a job--exchanging personal time and effort for money--is needed. Given any opportunity, people will gravitate towards those jobs that they find, for them, optimally attractive. That means some combination of interesting, challenging, and enjoyable. What makes a job each of those things in turn involves such things as compensation, ease, sociability, etc. Now, take as a given that rational people will if possible seek to maximize (however they define that), the aspects of life they enjoy: free time, physical comfort, emotional stability, friendships and family, and so on. Education (whether academic or trade) is a catalyst that creates choice: the ability to choose the best option to maximize that which is valued. Now, as you've pointed out in a roundabout way, there are many things that have value in and of themselves (art, relationships, etc). But intrinsic value can't be exchanged. For example, creativity is meaningful, but can't be used by itself to pay rent. Creativity must be *applied* in some way that can be converted into an object or idea that another can use, for which that other will pay money. Hence, the very essence of a job: the application of one's physical strength and dexterity, imagination, creativity, insight, wisdom, and knowledge towards a project that others find valuable. You use engineering as a topic. The people that choose engineering as a vocation are the people that for whatever reason, find engineering to be optimally attractive. Other find that optimal attractiveness in biology, or teaching, or plumbing, or auto repair. Why people find attractiveness in the things they do, speaks to the very things that make us human: nature, upbringing, bias, aptitude, exposure, etc. You as an individual, have preferences and needs that change over time. As a child you may have loved grilled cheese sandwiches, and now as an adult you don't. You used to run a lot as a teen, but after a bad car accident that broke your hip, you now require a cane to walk. Companies and other organizations are similar: Nokia was once a forestry/paper company, and when it saw little growth in that industry, it moved into electronics like cell phones. Its preferences changed, as did its needs (fewer foresters, more electrical engineers). Ultimately, it's just about the balance of ""need"" and ""want."" But you're missing the ""need"" part. You want to just do what you want to do and not be bothered; but you need money (by way of a job) in order to do so. And having a job means trading away some want (to not be bothered) for need (money). &gt;After university, how can I go peacefully to bed without fearing not having an existence the next morning anymore? You can't. Not entirely. You can only make well-informed decisions that minimize the fear. Accepting that there are many things outside of your control (earthquakes, war, getting laid off) is a big part of maturation. I don't say that with *any* mean or sarcastic intent.

"How to get a R1 position with good research output but little/no teaching experience. Hi, I would like some advice on what I can do to increase my chances at getting a R1 or R2 job (R1 first preference) with little/no teaching experience. Some context below: During my PhD, I was a TA in my first semester. After that I was put on a grant by my advisor so I was a RA throughout. I was aware that both research and teaching are needed for a TT job and so I tried to get a class to teach. But whenever I went down that path, my advisor would say that teaching does not matter in R1 so better to stay on the grant and get as much research/grant experience. So I got sufficient research experience and published a bunch of papers but had only TA and guest lecturer experience. In hindsight, I should have taught at least one class as instructor of record instead of blindly trusting my advisor. After my PhD, I am now a first year postdoc at a reputed research lab. This is a research position so obviously I have no teaching opportunities (aside from again being a TA or giving guest lectures). In my experience being on the job market, while teaching may not matter as much for R1, the job market is brutal at the moment and even if you are doing good research, limited teaching experience WILL get you disqualified in the later stages of the interview process, especially when you are stacked against others who have BOTH research and teaching experience. Additionally, doing exceptional research takes time. So even if you try your best, the research you do in your PhD/Postdoc is not nearly as exceptional (unless you are really smart, which honestly I am not. I am more hardworking than smart). Anyways, the point is that getting into a R2 and then graduating to a R1 may be a more realistic path to take, but this becomes a problem for people like me who were advised to focus on research in the first place. With this context in mind, what can I do to increase my chances at getting a TT job at a R1, since a R2 position is quite impossible with my limited teaching experience. I will be on the job market soon but am quite dejected by my situation.

I'm the top student grades-wise in my department and I've been literally told by professors that I'm the best undergraduate they've ever worked with (their words, not mine - I'm not actually cocky). I have done research in my discipline since freshman year and I've been told by many people in my field that I'll have no issue getting into whatever grad school I want to. I liked working in my lab a lot and want to stay there for grad school but I'm wondering if I'll be ""missing out"" by not applying elsewhere? There are higher-ranked universities than the one I want to attend (though it's still a well regarded public research university) but I don't want to take the risk of not finding a supervisor and lab I like or getting stuck with an uninteresting project. I can't think of a good reason not to take this offer (and I really don't want to have to stress about admissions - I've spent my whole undergraduate career worried about grad admissions so I would maybe be able to ""relax"" for once), but still have fear of missing out.

"Torn between two grad schools for Computer Science :(. Hi everyone, I am currently in a dilemma and would greatly appreciate your help. I have been accepted to three grad programs in Computer Science of which I'm torn between two. My ultimate aim is not to join academia but to obtain a research position in R&amp;D. The **first** program is a Masters (MMath with Thesis) program at the University of Waterloo. Some of the details about my package and supervisor: * Stipend is decent * The research area is very exciting * The reputation of Waterloo's CS program - even at the graduate level- is really, really good. Also, many huge tech companies visit the campus so industrial exposure would be brilliant * The location is safe, and I'm fine with harsh winters in Canada * My project is interdisciplinary in nature involving 2 different departments * Professor was not mentioned in my SOP so seems he is very interested in recruiting me However, while my potential supervisor seems really chill and great to work with, I contacted a former student from this lab who told me that the lab itself and the research project are both great and shouldn't disappoint me but also gave me a heads up about the professor not having much expertise in my intended research area. He had no complaints about his work there, though, and said that I shouldn't face any problems. Now, the **second** program is a PhD from The University of Notre Dame. I've tried googling and can't really find anything major about their Computer Science and Engineering department. Nobody I've asked seems to know anything about them in the context of Computer Science. However, my potential supervisor seems absolutely amazing. He has been very helpful throughout and just seems like a genuinely kind person who takes a sincere interest in his students. The research fit is **not** as good as that at Waterloo - I like the area but it's just not as exciting. However, this professor's students have undertaken internships at major tech companies and the stipend that is being offered to me is very generous. His students also tell me that he is a great supervisor, among the best in the department, and is very knowledgeable and helpful and respects work/life balance. Also, I have been accepted into a PhD program at the University of Illinois at Chicago. I was accepted without any interview and have been assigned a temporary adviser. The research fit is the same as Notre Dame but I haven't really got to know my adviser on the same level as the professor at ND. The stipend is decent - around the same as Waterloo when you factor in cost of living. I think their CS program is stronger than the one at Notre Dame but I'm not too sure how the two programs compare against each other. My major concern now is the apparent lack of expertise in my intended research area at Waterloo - I am absolutely fascinated by their program but I am worried that my supervisor there may not be able to guide me enough to advance my research career. I really, really want to go there but I'm not really sure whether that would be the wisest decision considering my desire to pursue a PhD afterwards. If you could advise me in any way it would be extremely helpful. All perspectives are more than welcome!

For an undergraduate in an introductory course, I’m just happy to see they found a source and cited. Articles from such outlets show up in our library search tool, something I encourage students use when writing the assignment.

On the other hand, I’m not sure it’s worth my time and effort to explain all of that for a point that students may not really care that much about.

So, I am a 24F who just finished her masters. My program involves a third year teaching fellowship following the completion of the degree, so while I’m technically no longer a student, I’m still in the program and am now an employee of my school. This summer, I’ve been working at an academic summer camp on a different campus, and one of my graduate school professors (we’ll call him John; he’s a 67M) also lives here year-round; he just flies to the city where he teaches every week. An expensive and senseless commute, but anyway.I ran into him in town last week and he said if I had a day off we should get together for dinner. I immediately accepted; I’ve had dinner alone with John twice before, as he always takes out the grad students one-on-one. As first-years, my female friends and I initially found his invitations strange, but we ultimately decided he was harmless. We’d all been out with him alone and nothing strange had ever happened. He’s a very talkative guy who usually spent the first twenty minutes of class asking us about our lives, so we decided he was just really friendly. So, a few nights ago we had dinner. It was fine, same as usual: he asked a few questions about my summer but mostly talked about himself. He’s always been this way—a bit self-obsessed and so garrulous it’s hard to get a word in during conversation. We mostly talked about the grad program and our respective summer travels abroad. Innocent conversation, nothing weird. When we left, we walked down the sidewalk together until we had to go in different directions. I thanked him for dinner, moved to turn around, and he surprised me by pulling me into a hug and giving me a long, loud kiss on the cheek. At first I thought it was kind of funny, maybe just a European affectation he decided to use since we’d been talking about travel, but after a few minutes I began to feel kind of grossed out. I’m not especially close to this professor. I had two classes with him and that’s it. I tried to imagine the scenario with different people, with one of my other male professors or with me and one of my male students, and it seemed to me that what happened was wildly inappropriate. John has never done anything like that in the city where our university is, not to me or any of the girls in my cohort, so I feel like being far away made him bold. He knew no one else was around and he could get away with crossing some boundaries. Am I overthinking this? Was he just saying goodbye? I’ve certainly had people kiss me on the cheek as a greeting, but they’ve all been older females and it’s always been just a quick peck, never a loud, wet smooch. And it’s usually not embarrassing; there were people around, and as I walked away they definitely gave me weird looks. My friends in my cohort said John definitely crossed a line and that if I want to reach out to him and say what he did was not okay, that would be totally reasonable. My mom, who can sometimes have old fashioned attitudes about assault and harassment, was 100% on my side and said he was taking advantage of me. So. I’m not sure where to go from here. If my program were actually over, I’d just let it go, but I’m going to be teaching there another year and will be around this professor at department events. I’ll definitely see him less than usual, but that’s not the point. Our program is predominantly female, and I can’t help but wonder if I ought to say something to somebody else in power. But then I’d feel embarrassed—it’s not like he did anything overtly sexual. But at the same time, I’ve been working through some childhood sexual abuse stuff this past year and am at a point where anyone even touching me is upsetting. Obviously John couldn’t have known this, but I’m worried that if I complain and say I was genuinely upset by this incident, that whoever handles the incident will want to know why I was so upset by what could’ve just been an overly zealous goodbye. I have no idea what to do. I’ve felt nauseated ever since it happened and the more I think about it, the madder I get. If anyone has any advice, please let me know.

"Looking for good Digital Media Design courses. I've recently graduated secondary school and am looking for a good school that offers a digital media design course.

"Is it just me, or has radical feminists in Humanities have gone too far. I've been thinking lately about the state of feminism, and I can't help but feel that something has gone wrong. While I believe that the first few waves of feminism were incredibly important and achieved great progress for women's rights, I feel that in recent years, a more radical strain of feminism has emerged that is doing more harm than good. One of the biggest problems I see is that this radical feminism has alienated a lot of men. Instead of focusing on equality, it often seems to be about demonizing men and portraying them as the enemy. This not only creates resentment and division between the sexes, but it also makes it harder to address real issues like domestic violence and sexual assault. Another issue is that this radical feminism often seems to be more concerned with ideological purity than with practical solutions. For example, there's a lot of focus on things like language policing and ""call-out culture,"" which can create a hostile environment for anyone who doesn't toe the line. This can make it difficult to have open and honest conversations about complex issues. Here are a few examples of where I think contemporary feminism has gone off the rails: * **The belief that all men are inherently oppressive:** This simply isn't true. While it's important to acknowledge that sexism and patriarchy exist, it's also important to recognize that not all men are sexist or oppressive. Painting all men with the same brush is unfair and counterproductive. * **The focus on ""microaggressions"":** While microaggressions can be hurtful, the obsession with them can sometimes lead to people being afraid to say anything at all. This can stifle free speech and make it difficult to have meaningful conversations. * **The idea that women can never be wrong or held accountable:** This is simply not true. Women are just as capable of making mistakes as men, and they should be held accountable for their actions. I'm not saying that all feminists are radical or that all forms of feminism are harmful. But I do believe that the radical strain of feminism that has emerged in recent years is doing a disservice to the cause of gender equality. Here are a few examples from humanities and literary studies where I think an overly rigid or radical approach to feminism can be problematic: * **Interpreting all classic literature through a solely feminist lens:** While it's valuable to analyze how women are represented and to uncover patriarchal themes, reducing complex works solely to their treatment of women can be limiting. For example, Shakespeare's plays explore a vast range of human experiences, and while analyzing gender dynamics is important, focusing *exclusively* on that can obscure other themes like ambition, power, and morality. * **Dismissing male authors or characters entirely:** Some argue that reading or studying works by men perpetuates patriarchy. This can lead to excluding important voices and perspectives from the literary canon. For example, dismissing Hemingway because of his macho persona means missing out on the nuanced exploration of masculinity in his novels. * **Focusing only on female suffering:** While it's crucial to acknowledge the historical and ongoing oppression of women, a singular focus on victimhood can be reductive. It's equally important to celebrate female agency, strength, and complexity. For example, focusing solely on Ophelia's madness in *Hamlet* ignores her intelligence and agency earlier in the play. * **Rejecting any critique of female characters or authors:** Some argue that any criticism of a female character or author is inherently misogynistic. This can create an environment where it's impossible to have nuanced discussions about female representation. For example, critiquing the actions of a female villain in a novel shouldn't automatically be labeled as an attack on women. I believe a more balanced approach to feminism in the humanities allows for a richer understanding of literature and culture. It's about acknowledging the complexities of gender dynamics without resorting to oversimplification or exclusion. I'm curious to hear what others think about this. Do you agree that radical feminism has gone too far? Or do you think I'm off base?",Academic,High,2.0,web:pullpush:r/academia:submission:unfair,High,2,4316,696,0,"Is it just me, or has radical feminists in Humanities have gone too far.",0

"Help navigating life post PhD (TESOL). Hi everyone, I have been part of this forum through different accounts over the past five years from when I wanted to do a PhD and I did learn a lot about academia from here. I'm in India and from the summer of 2018 I wanted to do a PhD abroad (with some institutions in mind). I had asked my professors for LoR and had started working on my SOP etc and got an IELTS score as well. As I did not have any support from my family (not just financial but just no support whatsoever), it was very stressful, scary, and difficult on many levels. I worked part-time doing lesson planning, online event planning, creating and selling children's literacy materials etc, to pay my master's fee but I wasn't able to afford the application fee and potential visa fee etc for the PhD. Some professors whom I looked up to for support also took advantage of my vulnerability and ambition. I ended up doing a PhD in India itself as that's what I could afford. My family is financially well off and that made it difficult for me to borrow from anybody and I also do not have relatives or anybody close due to the lonely childhood and family background. My family outright refused to even take me to the airport when I had my PhD interview and as it's a town with no cab services, and the flight was early morning, I had to request many people for help. I managed to reach and cleared the interview. Although I started the PhD with defeat and compromise on my dreams, I tried my best at this PhD. Life was difficult with the UGC NON NET stipend but I qualified for the UGC NET JRF with 99.99 percentile and I was relieved. But the pandemic postponed life for a semester and more, and the JRF paperwork was pending for years that I had to take up online teaching and even consider leaving the PhD as I could not afford my house rent. My family that was never supportive made more issues dragging me into many family drama, and stooped to accusations of morality that hurt me very much. I struggled with stress and anxiety because of this mounting pressure from family issues and my vain attempts at therapy also led to unfortunate incidents. Then I tried to focus on just work and I started presenting at conferences, lecturing, publishing, and today I am close to submitting my thesis and turning a new life. But as I reflect on it all, I feel very sorry for myself seeing how much I struggled all because of my ambition. I have no friends or family and life feels like some single player computer game to be honest. I could not apply for any doctoral exchange fellowship even though I wanted to because of the pandemic and also because of my stressful situation where I had to focus on the bare necessities like house rent and daily food. I feel I missed out on a lot of opportunities throughout my last one decade of education (BA, MA, PhD) and I feel inferior compared to my classmates who went on to do their master's and PhD abroad. I don't know how I can progress further as I feel I am much behind given my entire education has been in India. I do not know how to apply for a post doc or any research grants etc and I also feel hopeless that a post doc might be the only chance I have to get that international experience which is valuable not just for my resume but also for my personal growth. All my colleagues have foreign PhDs and post docs and I fear that I may be much behind my peers academically. I'm in TESOL and my research interests are towards applied linguistics. How can I move forward from here? Could someone help me navigate the post PhD path ahead from the point where I am? I elaborated on my past and present because this the reality I live with and a lot of advice on the internet isn't applicable because I lack the prerequisites such as a back up or support system.

"Student forums. Title: The Importance and Benefits of Student Forums in Academic Life In today’s interconnected world, student forums have become a vital platform for communication, learning, and collaboration among students. These online or physical communities offer students a space to share knowledge, seek help, and engage in academic and extracurricular discussions. Whether integrated into school systems or hosted on independent platforms, student forums are reshaping the way learners interact and grow together. --- What Are Student Forums? A student forum is a platform—usually online—where students can post questions, exchange ideas, and discuss topics related to academics, career development, hobbies, and campus life. These forums may be open to the public or limited to specific institutions or classes. Popular examples include platforms like: College or university-specific discussion boards Course-specific forums on sites like Moodle, Google Classroom, or Edmodo Social learning communities like Quora, Reddit (e.g., r/college), and Stack Exchange (for technical subjects) --- Key Benefits of Student Forums 1. Academic Support Student forums serve as peer-to-peer help centers. Students struggling with a concept can post questions and receive answers from their classmates or seniors. This collaborative problem-solving enhances learning and deepens understanding. 2. Resource Sharing Students often share lecture notes, textbooks, examination tips, project ideas, and tutorials. This helps create an inclusive learning environment, especially for students who may have missed classes or need additional support. 3. Skill Development Participating in forums helps students improve their communication, critical thinking, and technical writing skills. Explaining a concept to others also reinforces their own knowledge. 4. Sense of Community Forums create a sense of belonging and community. Students feel less isolated, especially in online or hybrid learning environments. They can connect with peers who share similar academic interests or face common challenges. 5. Career and Internship Discussions Many student forums include sections on internships, job placements, and career guidance. Seniors often share their experiences, recommend opportunities, and guide juniors through application processes. --- Challenges in Student Forums Despite their advantages, student forums can face certain issues: Misinformation: Not all answers provided are accurate or reliable. Spam and Distractions: Unmoderated forums can become cluttered with irrelevant or promotional content. Cyberbullying or Harassment: Without proper moderation, forums may also become a space",Academic,High,2.0,reddit:r/students,High,2,2684,368,0,Student forums.,0

It ties to that assignment, but this was an interesting turn of events. The outline to the debate was ""graded"" today, a solid 0/0, but the comment the instructor left was interesting. She said my outline looks great, but she says that she understands if I would likely want to write a paper rather than complete a video debate like what was originally supposed to happen, and that if that is the case, I should let her know so she could update the rubric for me. I'm not going to lie, I'm a terrible speaker, especially at debates. The person I am when I speak and the person I am when I write are two very different people. This instructor knows how I write and had recommended that I looked into a research Master's program.

Not only that, but I'm nervous recording myself as last time I attempted to record myself for the last debate, I ended up installing a fake Zoom app on my laptop that came with adware from PCAppstore, so I somewhat have anxiety with dealing with any sort of recording software. However, on the other hand, I feel as though this is unfair to my classmates who likely aren't given this same opportunity. It's the only reason I'm hesitant to immediately email her that I'd rather do the paper. So, I guess my main question is if I should write the paper or stick with recording myself with the debate?

"Would it be worth going back to school in my situation. The nearby community college now offers a radiography program that piques my interest, prompting me to consider returning to school. However, several factors make me hesitant to pursue this endeavor. Firstly, I reside in a rural area, and most things take a considerable amount of time to reach. The college campus is approximately 45 minutes to an hour away. While I can take most classes online, there’s a human anatomy laboratory class that requires full-time attendance for two semesters. After completing the anatomy class and the other prerequisite courses, I’d then need to apply to join the radiography program, which has a low acceptance rate, only 14 students a year, and hundreds are interested in the program as well. The people who applies that already works in the medical industry gets a higher chance of being accepted. If I’m accepted, I’d also have to attend hands-on radiography classes, as well as clinical training at random clinics or hospitals, which would involve an additional five days a week for three more semesters. Secondly, the job market in my area is limited, and I haven’t found employment in the past decade. This is precisely the reason behind my decision to return to school. I’ve applied to every company within a 50-mile radius, spanning three different states, including my home state. While I may receive a Pell grant and possibly a few scholarships, their combined amount might not be sufficient. Some scholarships are not applicable due to my existing associate’s degree, which proved ineffective in securing employment and has led to regret for the time and effort invested in obtaining it. Regarding online work, I’ve also explored that option. However, many platforms refuse to accept my application due to my reliance on T-Mobile home internet, which is stable enough but suffers from latency issues and cannot financially afford Starlink. There’s no fiber or cable internet available in my area, only DSL, which offers speeds of less than 1mb/s and frequently experiences interruptions.

"Need help! Very scared about college acceptances. Hello! For some quick context about my application I applied with a 4.5 W GPA; 4.0 UW; 1550 SAT; Strong ECs in Robotics/Digital Art; and years of work experience in web development/data science. Out of the schools I applied to (SDSU/SJSU/Cal Poly Pomona/Luis Obispo/UCLA/UCB/UCI/UCSD/Stanford/Princeton/Harvey Mudd/ SCU) I was accepted to every school accept UCI and Princeton for computer science. I was initially very excited getting into all of those schools but after receiving my financial aid packages my excitement quickly turned into fear. Every single school I applied to practically gave me no financial aid due to my SAI (48000) and its left me very frustrated these past couple of weeks. Factoring in the fact that my FAFSA was based on a year where we had an unnatural 40k spike in income and that we live in a HCOL area, my parents physically cannot afford to contribute more than 15k a year for attendance; yet, colleges think we can spend way more. These are my current options as they stand Stanford: 55k Harvey Mudd: Haven't received UCB/UCSD/SJSU/SDSU/SLO: Around 35-45k UCLA: 22k but I would have to commute 1 hr to + 1 hr back from campus Cal Poly Pomona: 33k but I would have to communte 30 min to + 30 min back from campus Its honestly just so disillusioning getting into all of these top STATE schools and still being completely unable to afford any of them simply because FAFSA only looks at our ""upper"" middle class income. It just feels like a complete slap in the face to all the effort I put into my ECs and academic success, even if I didn't do them to impress some college. I really want to commit to Stanford given not just its strategic placement but also the immense opportunities it provides for software engineering networks / entrepreneurship resources, but 160k in debt seems completely unreasonable.

"Worst college I've attended. This is an email I recently sent to the school that I'm discussing in this post. Mott Community College in Flint, MI. I beat myself up every day for leaving the University of Michigan to go to a local school. The amount of shit I have been put through with this school is mind boggling. IDC if this post is TLDR or if you do t like my paragraph structure. I'm not an English major nor do I care. With that out of the way, here we are. Yeah I didn't expect I'd get a reply. Would someone like to explain to me why I wasn't dropped from the class? Not only did I submit my withdrawal online but my advisor notified me that they would make sure it was successfully dropped for me since I had never dropped a class before. I also had my appendix burst and had to have a feeding tube surgically placed in my Jujenum. I sent in and submitted all documents regarding my hospital stay, I was told my class was dropped, and I wasn't notified of anything to do with failing the class or anything. Look at my transcripts. I'm an A student and twice now you've screwed me over. First was with Sunni Samuel who I reached out to when I was in her math class because I had a severe reaction to poison sumac and Ms. Samuel told me to spend the few weeks in the library doing my work and exams so I wouldn't spread it. I went to the library every single day I had class and I didn't get under a B on anything for the entire semester. I completed the class with roughly a 93 percent overall but was failed due to attendance but let's not forget, I was in the library where I was told to go and didn't miss a day. What kind of program are you guys running there? I'm not understanding why I'm being oppressed by the staff when I am on the Deans list and I'm an honor student. I take my education very seriously and Mott College is completely ruining my transcripts and education as a whole. Surely there is something that can be done. I would have graduated already if it wasn't for Sunni Samuels docking me for attendance. Pull the camera footage. You will see me in the library doing my work every. Single. Time. I don't appreciate being lied to by academic advisors and having a bill for 500 dollars put on my account. I have a GI Bill that not only did I go to war twice to get but I use the GI Bill so why my class wasn't covered is still beyond me. Not only did I do as instructed but I also passed with a higher score than anyone else in the class but subsequently failed for attendance. I had an electrical class with Matt Rhoda who failed me for my private conversation I was having with a friend about politics and police reform. As far as I was aware, freedom of speech is a right and not a privilege and constitutionally protects me (so I'm told). Not only that but I'm fairly certain that the syllabus also clarifies that freedom of speech is recognized and supported by the school. Why then was I failed for holding a conversation with my friends? I'm aware of the other nonsense that Mott likes to deal in such as forcing students to get new books every semester (most classes) when the only changes are the cover of the book and or will have a page added which leaves you off by one page. It isn't really a problem to be off by a page. I have went through at least 30 books since I've been attending and not one had been accepted for buy back. There is also the issue of padding teachers pockets with these ""new books"" because they added 4 sentences and got a writing credit. It's not my responsibility to pay the teachers. I pay Mott and you guys pay the teachers. Sure, teachers don't get paid much and I understand that but I shouldn't have to buy a new book every semester to appease the teachers. If this isn't the correct email address then please forward it to whomever I need to speak with. Id much rather try to figure something out that is mutually beneficial to us both as opposed to blasting this online through reddit, Google reviews, YouTube, and Facebook and X (formerly Twitter). I really don't have the time or patience to file complaints with the department of education but I can only be pushed around so much before I make a stand. This whole situation is ridiculous and I always assumed that colleges wanted people to graduate from their schools, especially an honor student with a GI bill to pay for it. It's not like you're going to get ripped off (like I have been). I don't want to transfer schools but I will if I have to. I'm not going to let anyone or any school stand in the way of my education that I subsequently pay for. Is this the type of behavior that Mott exhibits to all disabled veterans or is this just a targeted fascist attack on me and my character? I also don't appreciate that you guys have my transcripts locked out because I owe 500 dollars. There was a bill passed in July that states that schools and colleges can NOT withhold transcripts for an unpaid class. Id very much appreciate it if you would unlock my account so I can transfer schools (depending on how Mott wants to handle this). I really don't want to file a suit against Mott for not adhering to the laws and regulations recently passed. Thank you for your time and patience and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

"Is it ok that my professers favour me. I try hard in class and answer all the questions but both of the chefs who do my labs with me favour me over all the other 40 students.

"Berkeley DS vs CMU Stats/mL. Hi all! I’m a Cali resident, and I’m very grateful to have been admitted into both schools. I know most people would recommend Berkeley just based on my in-state status and lower cost of attendance, but there’s so much I like about CMU that makes this decision really tough for me. Net price: - CMU: ~$55K per year (not including any airfare/trips home) - Berkeley (in state): ~32k per year My family’s income is enough to afford Berkeley, and while CMU might be a bit tougher financially, affordability isn’t my primary concern. Rather, I’m more focused on both ROI and which school would better position me for securing a job straight after graduation. 1. Student/Career resources: - CMU has smaller class sizes and overall undergrad population, each student has access to more resources (like internships and research opportunities). - The college I would be in (Dietrich College of Social Sciences) also offers a Pittsburgh summer internship program that places undergraduates in paid internships around the city, though I’m not entirely sure about the acceptance rate or compensation. 2. Major selection (I want to major in data science with a minor in cs) - I’ve heard many horror stories of berkeley students struggling to get into classes, especially upper division cs ones. - Smaller class sizes and easier to get into classes at CMU so getting a minor in cs there would be more straightforward. (also more flexibility with my major at CMU since I am also considering IS, which I could likely transfer into. At Berkeley, however, I would be pretty much locked into data science even if my interests change) 3. Stress/grades. Both schools are gonna be pretty tough academically but i’ve heard that berkeley grading can be a real pain sometimes. The same can obviously be said about CMU but i’ve heard way more complaints regarding grade deflation at berkeley in particular. I’m not too worried about this (since it’s all rumors), but again it is still something i want to take into consideration when making my final decision.

"What’s your strategy for dealing with heavy coursework. I’m taking five courses this semester and have had heavy coursework thus far, three are online only, two hybrid. Our week for each class starts Sunday night at exactly midnight, and ending Saturdays at midnight. Two of them, western civilizations and sociology, are heavy reading courses. Standard 1 chapter a week, or a little under a chapter depending on how topics are broken up, and that’s nothing new. But they both have assignments dealing with the reading due in discussion boards on Tuesdays at midnight. Then both have responses to other posts in the boards due by Thursday. Sociology is an honors course so I need to work extra hard on it. Another two, my English course and my mythology course are run by the same instructor that has roughly the same due dates for both classes. There’s no textbook for them but we read multiple articles &amp; watch several videos a week with these two. It wouldn’t be bad if his requirement for discussion boards wasn’t “due by Thursday for main post, 2 replies due by Sunday” but with the expectation that 1 main post and 2 responses is baseline C. Still haven’t figured out what exactly he wants because I’ve written multiple 400+ word responses (minimum is 300) and taken extra care to make sure I’m providing a discussion instead of just repeating “yeah sounds good” like my classmates and haven’t gotten full points yet. He also expects us to be working on a writing assignment due in February for both courses. My last course hasn’t been too bad so far. Just a discussion board a week and a video or two that are easy enough to listen to in the car on the way to class or work. My biggest complaint here is that the reading that is assigned and the videos need to be watched by Tuesdays in order to participate in class.

"You have a 3rd option. Borrow money for a dorm room. I do not know your personal situation but here is general advice 1) If you are estranged form your parents, who most fill out FAFSA with you, go to a youth homeless shelter. They will know a lawyer who will be able to help you pro bono. They will also have other resources that can help you. 2) Once you have a dorm room you will have a mailing address. Get any government docs mailed there. This also allows you to get a job now that you have a permeate address + all your docs. 3) Depending on the exact circumstances of why you are homeless, there is a high probability that you will qualify for a pell grant. 4) They won't let you park overnight.

"I rushed, and I regret it (an alumnus' perspective). Hey everybody. I'm 23M, and I graduated last year. I was in a frat, and I was very popular. I had leadership positions within Greek life and the house I was in specifically. My resume found great success, but I'm hear to say that - despite what your parents have said about their greek life experiences, despite what those energetic friends of yours are saying about greek life, despite what you see on barstool sports, and despite my opening couple of sentences - **please, please,** ***please*** **don't rush your freshman year if you can help it at all**. Honestly, whatever floats your boat, but if you're not the type to drink all the time, give zero shits about classes (and, by proxy, your future), or generally not care greatly about yourself and your life - please reconsider rushing, period. I rushed because my dad pushed me to do so. He was in a frat, and is obsessed with his time in college, even now, over 40 years later. I never understood the draw, but I figured that if my literal father figure had such positive experiences, it couldn't hurt me either. It did. It did badly, and in unseen ways. I didn't take the time to learn myself first, and spend some uncomfortable time alone in college, getting to know myself and my interests. Instead, I jumped headfirst into a centuries-old culture of abuse and strict hierarchy (both formally and socially), thinking it would be different because my frat said that they were 'not like the rest', and to their credit, for a bit they weren't. Then the school year started. To give you a quick rundown: \- For the first semester, I effectively had another full-time class: the frat. Yes, they assigned homework, and we had mandatory meetings each week, with drills after each meeting to see what we knew. I say drills and laugh, because here's what it actually was: all of us (new members, not yet initiated mind you) on our feet in the dark basement in front of a fireplace, screaming at the top of our lungs the information we were expected to know. Our frat wasn't as abusive as others on campus, but if you got something wrong, you stood in front of the fire, and for each time thereafter you got something wrong, you took a step closer to the fire. One guy's pants started smoking, just from having to stand in front of the flames (which were constantly made larger). This was once a week, for the entire first semester of college (oh, and you're in a suit for this too. You'll see the pledges on campus - khakis, white shirt, blue jacket, red tie, and complete exhaustion in their eyes). \- After initiation, nothing changes. You're not special, and in fact, people are less interested in you, because you're not someone who can be bullied as easily anymore. However, bullying and harassment are still rampant. Get ready to keep your porcupine quills up the whole time you're there, because if there's one thing that a group of toxic, insecure people are always looking for, it's the next downward punching bag. Oh, but if you defend the person getting bullied, you get sucked into the fold, too. I mentioned I was popular - I used this 'soft power' to step in and defend as many people as I could, but something else about frats - if the bullying gets exposed, they just get better at hiding it. It's an absolutely brutal and immature loop that honestly only gets more complicated as the years of college go on. It's not a game you can win unless you physically throw down (which everyone wants to do already) or leave. \- There is no academic support, there is no alumni network, there are no job perks after college. I don't give a shit what the promo stuff they give you says. Those are for the guys who rush at frats where their daddies are big contributors, and almost only for those guys. If you find something, it's blind luck. Also, even if there are alumni looking to hire - ask yourself if they're really people you want to work for and with. Are they actually different from the people you so despise now, or are they just older versions of those guys? (I'll tell you right now, 9/10 times it's the latter). The houses say they have study hours and study times - try getting work done. I dare you. For several months, I literally spent more hours in the library on campus than I did almost anywhere else. Maybe that's typical. But is it such a crime to want to work peacefully at the place you reside? The alumni network consisted of whoever the fuck showed up on gamedays, and they were always piss hammered anyways, so it didn't matter what you said to them. They weren't going to remember you. \- The culture is drinking. That's it. That's literally it. I want to elaborate, but doing so would only dilute this point. I abstained from drinking for the sake of self-improvement after my first semester freshman year, and found myself almost immediately devoid of any relatable group of people. It was really weird, actually. People treated me like I had a issue because I *didn't* drink like a fish. Now, these are the biggest four. I could go on for ages, but that's to be saved for my therapist. I'll also say that, yes. I chose to do this. Yes, I chose to pay $900 a semester and $500+ a month for rent, just to be miserable. Yes, I could have gotten out! But then do what? I'd have to find housing and the money to pay for it, for one - while paying for the frat, because you're locked into year long lease contracts at the house if you want to (or can) live there. How did it hurt me in unseen ways, you ask? It's a hard one to articulate, but it definitely has to do with not feeling fit in at all for four years without feeling like there was any out, while having a full courseload, while working weekends and any spare time at all to support yourself (I had to pay dues and most of rent myself), so no time to socialize in the only way the only people around you seem to know how. I've spent this past year debriefing/reeling/trying to process my college experience and figure out who the fuck I actually am because I didn't get that chance (or, rather, give myself that chance) in college. Now, I want to be very clear. It's very easy for the older ones of us to look back at this life and be like 'well, duh. of course a frat is going to be that way.' how do you know that? how *did* you know that? how would those who don't or didn't have positive role models, or any at all, know that, before going to college? And before I hear 'just look it up online', politics has shown us that that just doesn't fucking work. If you've made it this far, thanks for the read. If you're on your way to college, think twice about rushing. If you've already rushed, don't beat yourself up, but still do some thinking about where you are, who you are, where you want to go, and who you want to be, and if the organization you've joined will actually help you get there, or only create more swamp to trudge through in pursuit of your goals. edit: ""*- if the bullying gets exposed, they just get better at hiding it.*"" this is why frat rituals/the frat itself is/are so secretive. You don't talk publicly about things you're embarassed to be doing. edit 2: ""*Yes, I chose to pay $900 a semester and $500+ a month for rent, just to be miserable.""* This was the cheapest option on my campus at the time. There were scant financial support opportunities on my campus for those who were financially insecure. I ask for your consideration - what would they do? EDIT 3 - AND THIS ONE IS IMPORTANT: I forgot to talk about the rampant - R A M P A N T - homophobia in Greek Life. Like it's actually insane. Speaking for frats specifically here, everyone has such an inflated ego that everyone thinks that everyone is hitting on them - including the dudes - and because these are the ultra-dude-bro type, no homo was the name of the game. To the Nth power. We had a couple of openly gay guys in the house when I first got there, which was cool. Everyone was too afraid to talk to them because they were too afraid of being perceived as gay. They all dropped in-mass when they realized how much the guys in the house fucking hated gay people. This was because those guys stopped hiding it, and the rest of the house didn't care enough to stand up for them (I was only one person, mind you, in the face of 100+). I really can't say that their safety was ensured, but thank God they never stayed at the house for long enough to find out. If you're unsure as to your sexuality, there's nothing wrong with that - just please be really, really careful around frats.

I’ve really lost all interest and motivation in the project, and struggle to even define what it is I’m looking for. I think I want to change to a topic that feels more relevant or impactful. The problem is that I have no other ideas for topics. I pretty much stumbled into my current topic by just following threads from one reading to another. How should I bring this up with my advisor? (My supervisor, the professor I work with.) We have been meeting regularly all summer, and she’s aware that I’ve been having some trouble with the project but I have not yet suggested a complete change in topic. I’m worried about throwing out progress, but then again this might be the best time to do it, as I haven’t really started the dissertation yet. Besides talking with my professor, how do I find a new topic? I’ve tried looking over recent research in my field, but wasn’t feeling inspired by anything. I feel very lost on what to do next. Any advice would be appreciated",Academic,Medium,1.0,web:reddit:r/gradschool:search:exam schedule problem,Medium,1,1255,223,0,Changing Topic.,0

"I ""punished"" them with a zero because they didn't turn in the work. At least my students at Heaven State University are too honest to try passing AI off as their own work, so I should be happy. If only one of the non-traditional students hadn’t decided to yell, scream, and create a scene about how they knew people on campus. They even threatened to get me in trouble for not giving them preferential treatment. Instead of simply asking for forgiveness after admitting they had forgotten the assignment, they insisted on submitting their very late work, which had already been given several extensions, and demanded that I grant them an A for it. Their excuse was that they believed they didn’t need to submit a complete, finished paper since they had submitted a half-done version a week early. However, missing half the assignment meant that I would have had to give them a terrible grade. If I had left that assignment sitting in my inbox without informing them that it was incomplete and that they needed to finish it to receive a good grade, I would still be in the wrong, to them, wouldn’t I? I swear it's like we just can't win unless we just give everybody an A. It appears that the Administration has supported me so far, as I calmly informed these students about the syllabus. In the syllabus they get to drop a few assignments from their grade but they have to honestly admit that they simply forgot. I also aim to be fair to everyone else. Sorry I don't care that you've been a student here before and got a degree from here before and that you know a lot of people here.

"Is college Algebra hard or am I just stupid. I finally hit my breaking point tonight trying to study for college Algebra and I don’t know if I really am just a low intelligence person or if it is a hard course. I have a test this Friday and my Final within the next 2 weeks, and I am far from ready. I go to a community college right now and was forced to start math out at Elementary level Algebra because I never took any placement tests or did very well in high school due to mental health issues. I passed that class as well as intermediate Algebra in the same semester as 7 week courses and got A’s in both. Now, I can almost guarantee I will fail this course, even though I have had double the weeks and have studied triple. We use Pearson online for the course, and despite the actual in-person class being 3 hours long, basically everything that is taught in the class is not on the homework or practice tests. The professor uses Pearsons built in slide shows and there are quite literally slides where Pearson gets symbols wrong or their math is just completely wrong which throws me off. I have been trying for nearly 3 weeks now to get this one section of homework done, only 18 questions, but I just can’t. I tried taking the chapters practice test but I feel like everything I “learnt”, just doesn’t show up and its all unrelated. I know I have a issue with focusing, I always have its why I can’t take online classes because I get super distracted but I just don’t want to be seen as dumb. I am trying to go into finance and have been crying myself to sleep the past few weeks because I feel like a complete idiot who can’t understand basic math problems. I don’t even care if I pass with just a C, I just need to pass and prove to myself that I am not an idiot, but it just feels impossible. I can’t get tutoring as I work 7 days a week on top of full time school, and all the other classes I take i’m doing great in. I even just got an A on my accounting test which I know a lot of people who take finance struggle in that class so that really boosted my mental health for a bit. I am just so scared of being an idiot. Its been making me lash out more than normal and be constantly in a bad mood. I yelled at my puppy the other day while playing with me because out of nowhere my brain just started to remind me of how I am doing in Algebra.

"I think I have no chances of entering a reputable Grad school. Any solution? Can I transfer after two semesters. So, as per title. I'm currently working full time in the US and I'd like to enter a Master's Program in Finance. There 3 problems. 1) My Bachelor's Degree was in Italy. (Polimi is a good school, but still a foreign one.) I've immigrated very recently. 2) My Bsc was in Engineering. And Italian/European BSc are 3 years. No minors, all courses are related to (in my case) Engineering. I'm planning on doing whatever courses are missing/required before I start the degree, there is a local University where I can do them without moving/paying for rent/changing jobs (I assume the name doesn't matter, they are individual courses). 3) My grades were very average. 89/110 in Italian numbers (2.7-3.0 GPA? at least doing a numerical proportion). According to WES that translates into a 2.1 GPA (I am sure they slashed all grades, but I haven't found a better organization yet for the degree conversion. So I'm planning on giving 89/110 until I get a fair conversion from an alternative source.). In other words, no recognized University would accept my application. Even if they had no problem with foreign degrees, I assume my GPA would be a deal breaker for all of them (even if kept as 2.7-3.0 it's probably too low), even more so if they required a WES conversion. First of all, any chance I can get into a good University in the US? I am willing to take mountains of debt or move anywhere within the US. I don't have recommendations, unlike here they are not a thing in Italy (at least for Undergrad courses). Let's assume my chances are zero. If I start a Finance Master's in the closest University that accepts me. And if I then get perfect grades (I mean 4.0), get into mountains of debt, is there any way of transferring into a better University after 2 semesters (would a high GPA or a future recommendation help?) Do people do this? I know that the name on that degree matters, whether interviewers admit it or not. And I don't want it to be the limiting factor for my career in 5/10 years. And If anyone in the Finance field has any suggestions for good and recognized Quantitative Finance programs that don't have a very high bar please write them.

"Why are female professors more snobby to students. I go to a #1 public university. The only two (semi) bad experiences I've had with professors involved female professors. Usually, I gravitate towards women and feel more comfortable, but as I reflect on this, I realize my male professors were the most accommodating, non-judgmental, and just.chill. And I'm comparing professors in equally difficult classes. Now, I understand the nuances of gender inequality and am very aware of this when I'm thinking of these situations, and I believe that if these rude experiences I discuss came from my male professors, I would also be just as offended! My first bad experience was when I was cold emailing for a lab as a research assistant. I emailed this postdoc about a publication she did (read the whole thing!), and she replied to my email with no hello, just **""That is** ***definitely*** **not what the publication was about. I am not currently recruiting.""** Like.what happened to hello? She literally typed those words and hit send, trying to discourage me. Sorry I misread your publication -- I don't know all the jargon, I'm a first year! And I'm clearly trying to learn! Really disrespectful and just plain mean. It definitely made me feel stupid. My second bad experience is when I'm trying to request points back on my midterm (which I objectively should've had, trust me) and my professor says that this isn't the place to ""argue for points,"" and refuses to give me the 1% back. I literally was not arguing (I'm so non-argumentative, especially with authority figures). I was just asking why I got the grade I got! Needless to say, that accusation made me shut up and fear going to her for help. I know female professors had to work harder in a male-dominated space -- like dang, that's really impressive! But I don't see how that warrants being so disrespectful to students, especially female students who are eager to learn and succeed in school, just like they once were.

"Classes are useless. how do i lock in. I'm an Applied Physics / Computer Engineering major. I really enjoy my physics classes since they are very new, but every single engineering class I have taken has taught me things I already know, and I feel like I'm wasting my time in lecture. Are there any ways I can take advantage of the resources I have access to while at university to so I can stay ahead of everyone and be a more competitive applicant when I enter the job market? **Engineering specific stuff**: for context, I'm a second year. I've taken basic circuits classes (up to rlc and opamp circuits) and next year I will be taking classes on semiconductors, more advanced amplifier classes, logic, vlsi, rf, etc. I'm worried since I already am familiar with about half of those things (I checked the syllabi and I am confident I could pass the classes without going to lecture at all). **Some things to note:** \- I have been really bad at going to office hours and getting to know professors. I want to start going to office hours but my problem has been I never have any questions about the courses so I've never had the need to go. I'm considering going and just asking questions about stuff that's not taught in the course if the professor specializes in it. Is this a good or bad idea? \- I'm taking these design classes where we get to actually make stuff and do your own research to learn things and these have taught me a lot. I get to use a lot of the campus engineering resources like the machining stuff on campus or the lab spaces, etc. I've gotten to learn a lot about other areas of engineering through this. \- I'm also in several student campus engineering design groups.

"Would taking a year off be bad. I'm a Junior in college. I've done everything right in the semesters leading up to this one and am on the track to graduate May '19. However, this semester was rough. It kicked my butt relentlessly and doesn't seem to want to stop. At the beginning of this semester, I was in a car accident that I'm still suffering pains from. Totalled my car so I had to work extra hours to get enough money to buy another one. Dealt with a concussion that made the simplest of tasks (studying, driving, reading, etc) painful and nearly impossible. Cut into February, and I had to deal with the sexual harassment and assault by my manager's (I'm the assistant manager) boyfriend who she hired. Nothing was done about it, thus I had to go to corporate which resulted in us losing three people. This made me acting manager (which I still currently am) with less than half the staff I need for the business to operate. As a result from all this stress, I'm failing my online class, missed way too many classes for my other courses, and overall just feel ready to quit. Originally I was going to take a semester off, but unfortunately that would add another whole year to my study as my college is too small to offer certain required classes during certain semesters. Now I'm considering taking a whole year off. I strongly believe that if I don't take off at least for a little bit, I'll just end up dropping out. The problem is that I'll probably lose my academic scholarship, which is good for another year.

"Why should I study. Kinda just a rant For context, I'm clearly far from bright. I'm currently a 12th grader in Asia. This question isn't commonly asked here. Anyway, because I'm not that smart, I study a good amount. Parents and teachers always are like ""study twice as hard if you need to"" well, twice apparently isn't enough for me to make up for it. However, I am an honor's student, how? Well, I worked hard enough to get decent math grades and I have a slightly unfair advantage called being half American in Asia, so I have good English grades. Which is somehow all you need to be an honors student in a small town. But I do feel like it isn't as much as people make it out to be since I've never had any proper training in English. Now, my college entrance examination is coming up, we got one of those big exams to determine where you gonna go. Everyone else's working hard and getting good, well most at least, and I'm not seeing any improvement whatsoever. Honestly, that slightly unfair advantage is the only thing keeping me afloat. (Which sucks btw, having you're best grade being from something you barely worked for while working so hard for everything else and getting nothing.)

What sucks even more is that when I heard college is apparently ""easier"" in the US, I asked my parents and they were like ""too expensive, you can do that for your masters"" because apparently that is the default around here.

"How to tell my parents I failed 2 classes last semester…. For the past 3 years I’ve been struggling with my depression a lot. I was diagnosed when I was in sixth grade but my parents only ideas of treatment are mental hospitals or just ignoring it. Last semester I really suffered and ended up not doing well in my classes and failed 2 of them. Both are required for graduation so I will need to retake them at some point. I refused to drop the classes, because I thought I could recover but realize it would’ve been so much better. My GPA is now a 1.96 and I took a class this summer that hopefully pulls me up out of academic probation but I have yet to tell my parents and they have a meeting with the dean on Monday. Last time I told them that I didn’t do well in a class they yelled at me and threatened to pull me out of college because Im just “wasting their money” and “will never do anything with my life.” My family does struggle with money, as my sister has many medical problems and we have a big family, so I understand them being upset, but rather understanding that people make mistakes and we need to learn from our mistakes, but also that I am an adult and need to figure things out on my own, my mom just gets involved and ends up causing more problems for me. I dont know what to do and I’m scared I’m going to lose everything if I tell them, or even worse if I let the dean tell them. I’m going to email the dean and ask her not to disclose much information besides what my mom already asked her about, but I don’t think there’s much that she could do because I signed a FERPA waiver so that they could have access to the billing portal. EDIT: I go to a private university and the tuition that isn’t covered is almost 20k this year bc our EFC was raised from FAFSA, but now my dad is out of work so it actually is much lower, but wasn’t the case when we did the FAFSA, so they’re already upset and yelling at me over that when it isn’t my fault at all",IT & Digital Services,High,2.0,web:reddit:r/college:search:portal not working,High,2,1971,390,10,How to tell my parents I failed 2 classes last semester….,0

"Had to withdraw from 4 classes. Is it over for me. Currently I’m a student at ASU Online. I get my tuition paid for by Starbucks. All of the classes at ASU are accelerated, which is honestly fine. The workload can be a little overbearing but that’s not why I had to withdraw from any classes. I was taking summer classes earlier this year, and withdrew from one of them because I had family stuff going on that completely distracted me from school and at the time I was also working overtime every single week at Starbucks so I had fallen so behind I couldn’t possibly get a passing grade. And then the next time I withdrew from my classes was because of the same reasons- my family issues and work schedule prevented me from being able to be as present as I should have been in my classes and they moved so fast that I had fallen extremely behind. Now, I’m about to have to withdraw from a class because of financial reasons. This class requires a textbook, which wasn’t cheap- but I got it. But once you buy the textbook you also have to buy access to the workbook that all of our assignments are in as well as an additional fee to be able to talk to our professor which is a mandatory assignment. It’s only 2 weeks into the course, but I’m already super behind because I cannot afford the textbooks that I need to do half of the assignments. Because of the way the class and schedule is set up, I only found out about all the extra stuff I had to buy after my groceries and rent and buying the textbook for the other class I’m taking as well as 1 of the 3 required for this class. It’s only 2 weeks into the class, out of 6- but no late work is accepted and I currently have a 30. Multiple assignments are due tonight which will drop my grade lower, and I’m unsure if I should just drop the class and take it next semester and make sure I have enough money for it- or if I should instead try to salvage my grade and buy the textbook after my next pay day. Either way, I’m worried I already messed everything up by withdrawing from too many classes",Faculty,Medium,1.0,web:reddit:r/college:search:fee issue,Medium,2,2050,395,6,Had to withdraw from 4 classes.,0

There was another female student last term whom I suspected of being interested in me romantically. No student had gone above and beyond to do anything kind like writing a thank you letter to me previously, and I thought L might be similarly motivated. It was a subconscious reaction on my part. When I had a chat with L, I didn't thank her for the letter; I pretended to not hear when she brought it up, and talked a lot about my wife. Several weeks later, L and I had a chat where she said she suspected what I was thinking - and said she wanted to make it clear that she had zero romantic intent and was only trying to help because I'm in a hard situation. She said she had shown the letter to the co-instructor of our class and no one had seen anything romantic in it except me. In hindsight, I see that she is not wrong as the letter only mentions my teaching skills and efforts to help students find jobs. I didn't apologize for the misunderstanding, but admitted what I was thinking, and told L I was trying to make it clear to her that I am married. I don't think I did anything improper in indicating a boundary there. Here's what made it worse - L also shared a personal story where her father was laid off when she was younger, presumably to sympathize, but I was not myself due to stress from the layoff, and laughed out loud a couple times when she was sharing this story. While I was speaking to L remotely, my wife came into the room, hovered in the background several times, told L that I need to go, and forced our conversation to shut down. Afterwards, I received an email from L saying that she was disappointed that I could not see her letter as a simple human gesture and had to see it as a romantic one; and that I did this because I have stereotypes about women. She wrote she thinks my wife should introduce herself to L if my wife comes into the conversation next time. I replied to her saying I'm uncomfortable with the assumptions she made about me and my wife. L then responded saying she is disappointed in the callous way I handled this situation; that she is hurt that I laughed at her story of her father being laid off; and that the way my wife acted was rude. She told me she will withdraw the thank you letter she sent to the administration. Several days later, I saw that she had written a review of me on Rate My Professor - saying that I lecture well, but I have a problem with mistaking neutral gestures as romantic ones; that this created discomfort for her; and that I made her afraid of engaging with male mentors in the future. I'm at a loss on what to do from here. I would like for her to take down the review but have no idea how to talk to her anymore. This is also a very stressful time for me (which L knows), and my energy is widely scattered. I'm wondering if I should apologize but not sure if an apology means anything at this point.

"IVF and academia. I'm an academic and run a research lab in the sciences and teach. I also need to do IVF for a fertility issue. Due to the specific nature of my diagnosis, I will likely need to do multiple egg retrievals before we are able to make viable embryos and then at some point we hope to do a frozen embryo transfer. There are so many unknowns with all this and the exact timeline is impossible to plan. Right now we are at a stage where we are going back and forth with various specialists for consults and waiting for tests before proceeding further. I have done egg retrievals before, so I know everything that goes into it. The effects of the drugs and what it does to my brain sucks enough, but the logistics are driving me nuts. I am comfortable finding last minute cover for a class for the surgery (I did this last year disclosing to a small number of supportive colleagues what was going on). But what is trickier for me is travel. Given that there is so much up in the air, it's impossible to know what roughly 2 week period I will be unavailable in advance. If I were to block out specific months for it, there is no guarantee that it would work out as planned. I've basically taken the attitude of ""accept all the invites, proceed as normal, cancel if you need to, buy plane tickets last minute."" Yesterday I got an invite in a couple months, which if all goes according to plan would probably conflict with this treatment. Except I have no idea if all will go according to plan. While my logical brain says ""it's not a huge deal to back out of this workshop, just say yes and pull out if it makes sense to later"" for some reason this gave me irrational jolts of panic. I think it was mostly just feeling so utterly out of control of my life. Just curious if anyone else had this experience, especially juggling academic travel with IVF. I realize that our travel is often rather privileged, because going to a conference/workshop/seminar is mostly optional and only benefits our career. I also ran into this while I was pregnant earlier this year and miscarried. I mostly said yes to conferences, and only said no to one optional commitment that otherwise I would have wanted to do that was completely dependent on me to drive and no one else could pick up the slack the semester of my due date. I made loose plans for how I would set up my PhD students for success if I went on maternity leave that I ended up not needing to a act upon (although deepening relationships with collaborators and co-supervisors has been generally good for most of my students regardless). On the bright side, this makes all the out of control uncertainties with grant funding and other vicissitudes of science seem like small potatoes (although I am not in the US, that would be a whole different level of chaos)",Fees,Medium,1.0,web:pullpush:r/Professors:submission:issue,Medium,1,2816,518,7,IVF and academia.,0

"5th Year Regrets. Hi all, I'm starting my 5th year in a chemistry PhD and questioning how much I want/need to invest in finishing. It is standard for people in my group to finish within about 5.5 years with 1-2 high impact papers. I'm working on one right now and am a second author on another pretty good paper that will probably come out in a year. I don't know how long it will take to write and publish my first author paper, as my boss is notoriously slow (2-3 year average to publish a paper once manuscripts start to be reviewed) &amp;#x200B; My boss is very friendly and the most lenient PI ever. I can name three people in the past 5 years that have ""graduated"" without publishing, and after not doing any experiments after their 2nd or 3rd years. I have been trying to move my projects forward, but hit a slump for most of last year due to virus problems and general lack of motivation. I like doing lab work, but every time I try to dig into the theoretical aspects of my work I get very discouraged and want to quit outright. I don't feel very confident with the math and get nervous when people ask me to write equations from memory and can't (why is that a thing?). I can't tell if I'm more incapable or uninterested in learning the material, as I care most about the applied parts of my work. I know everyone talks about imposter syndrome, but I find it hard to apply that to myself when I have literally seen imposters graduate. That sounds harsh but one of them did not even try to write a paper on their work before leaving with a PhD. &amp;#x200B; I suspect I would like more applied work, but I've also realized that the jobs most relevant to my work (pharmaceuticals) are likely in cities, where I don't want to live. I also don't need a high-paying job for the lifestyle I want. I got ridiculously giddy the other week when I realized how delicious (and cheap) red lentils are. &amp;#x200B; Lastly, my PI talked to me a few months ago about starting another project on the theoretical things that he said would ""make a nice PhD"" along with my other work. I don't know if I have to make a paper of it because of how grant funds work, or if I can do some experiments and yeet cause I don't want to be here that much longer. &amp;#x200B; So with that in mind, I feel like I have a few options: 1. Finish the PhD (\~1.5 years) 2. Try to finish earlier with a Masters (idk how feasible that is?) 3. Just leave Edit: I am a PhD candidate/finished comprehensive exams and am ""one more experiment"" away from having a complete story for my first author paper. &amp;#x200B; Looking for any advice on how to move forward",Examination,Medium,1.0,web:reddit:r/gradschool:search:exam schedule problem,Medium,1,2631,494,5,5th Year Regrets.,0

Besides, I don't really notice things like this unless they are too obvious. The first time I've noticed it was when I had a question about the lecture. There was one thing that was unclear to me. I asked my question in the classroom, but he said that we had no time for questions, and I should come to him after the class was over. So, I did it, and he said that he was running out of time, and I should visit his office during his office hours. Well, I didn't suspect anything. I went to that damn office and asked him the question about the lecture, and he started to play with my hair and put my hat on my face. I didn't get that joke. He didn't answer my question, so I left and was confused by his inappropriate behavior. &amp;#x200B; After that, he started to say that my performance in class was pretty low and he could help me, but I needed to come to his office at 9-10 p.m. He says it without any witnesses. So, I have no proof except for my words. The last time he said it to me, he mentioned that I would be highly likely to fail this module and winked if I didn't come to his office. I am puzzled. I knew I should have recorded his words on my phone or recorded a video.

"Is it fair to ban part-time students from student leadership. I'm a nontraditional undergrad student, which means that I'm waaaay older than most of my classmates. I didn't have the chance to go to college in my home country. Now I'm living in the U.S. with my spouse and since we hope to start a family in the future, I decided to pursue a degree to create better opportunities for myself and my family. I come from a very poor background. Just to give an example, Oreos were considered a luxury growing up. Also, I’m the first in my family to go to college. So, being here is something I'm incredibly grateful for. But because of financial limitations, I can only afford to take 9 credits per semester, which makes me a part-time student. Despite that, I've been really involved in a student advocacy club that means a lot to me. It's the only one of its kind on campus, and it's given me purpose and belonging. For the past year, I served in a leadership role within the club. No one from the university ever asked about my credit load, and I didn’t know it was an issue until now. This year, the club voted for me to take on the main leadership position. When I was going through the rules set by the office that manages student clubs, I happened to find out that I technically wasn't allowed to hold the leadership role I had already been in for the past year and that I wasn't eligible for the role I had just been elected to either. I reached out to them to clarify, and they confirmed that because I'm not enrolled full-time, I can't serve in these positions. All because I'm not full-time. Not because of my work ethic, not because of performance or reliability. Just because I can't afford to take 12 or more credits instead of 9. It feels so unfair. I've put in the work, I've shown up, and I’ve earned the trust of my peers. But I’m being told I can't lead, not because of who I am or what I’ve done, but because I don't have the money to be full-time.

"How US students pay for tuition and living, while in university. Hey, I want to ask how it works for you. For those who has similar problems. Do you have to have pre-saved amount of money before going to university? Can you take **loan on living expenses**? What are the **pre-requisites for such loans**. Who gives them. Otherwise, how you can cover living expenses if you're studying all the time at demanding degrees? What if you almost have no free time. How students get along financially while studying at university? I'd be happy and thankful for your response! \~ I'm from other country. I've started studying in 2020 and got caught in **financial whirlpool**, managed to finish only one year. I live in a country with three years mandatory militaty service. After I enrolled university and applied to scholarships, everyone denied me. I've tried to seek help to figure out how I can finance my living expenses and no one agreed neither to think together with me, nor to help. Not people outside, not people in universities, not social workers, not *""peers""*, no one. I went to bank recently, and they mocked at me, that there's no such thing. After I got back home, I've seen on their website info on student loans. And after I returned, they told me they won't give me any loan because I have too little money, no income. But I'm in the middle of studies and feel betrayed destroyed, and don't have hope if I can get to university at all. Family mocked at me, they told I have to go at work, though I always worked. It's time to get education. And I explained that I can't find a job to match the university schedule and studying efforts and so it covers my expenses. My other part of the family mocked me that I should go to work at factory, not specifying what. And I worked in all kinds of very difficult jobs since sixteen and f\*\*\*king army. While helping their kids at full extent. I knew it is so, but I kinda could't talk about that. But when they pissed me off completely, I started telling them about this family members being helped as example. To what they told me like what are they red rag to me. This really killed me and I'm considered bad lazy whatever. While they being helped. But what really destroyed me is that they continued to talk their talks all this time and it destroyed me emotionally. Don't want to help? Go away and don't disturb me, don't make me bad. don't make it worst than it is. Also, I'm in late 20s. And **can't save up enough money** objectively, **anyways**. Don't see any opportunities. And I consider moving out. I don't know. Where I'm accepted as human. **I'm looking at any opportunity and will try to do everything I can. I'll be figuring out ways.** I am only learning how to tell stories, communicate succinctly and eloquently.

"Just finished first semester of PhD. Feeling very lonely. Is this normal. I don't really want advice tbh, just to know if what I'm feeling is extreme or normal. When I started my PhD, I dealt with moving 900 miles away from my friends and family for the first time in my life while also going through a really difficult and toxic end-of-relationship period followed by the subsequent heartbreak of this person wanting nothing to do with me right after I moved. My friends back home were like my tribe. I felt like I had found people that I could live in a community with for the rest of my life and be happy. However, I was really interested by the research question I pursued (and still am). In addition, this PhD offers a very straightforward path to a reliable, well-paying career. All that, plus I had lived in my hometown for all 31 years of my life and was ready for an adventure. Maybe it was everything happening all at once, but while away (I'm home right now for the holidays) I became very, very lonely and felt like people don't care about me. I started to isolate myself because I resolved that I don't really care if I suffer. I felt like suffering is actually a fairly interesting mental state to be in. I was having very profound, interesting thoughts on life, philosophy, morality, and was feeling more motivated than ever to write. But now, I only have one really close friend and they have 6 hours from where I'm now living. Someone who lives in my building (right across the hall from my front door) is becoming a friend and I enjoy spending time with them, and I also enjoy the company of a few people in my cohort. I've just felt very alone, and whenever a friend lets me down (usually so unintentionally) I have this *completely new* impulse to just disappear and if they truly care then they'll reach out. Then when they don't I become more bitter about the world and let the relationship die. Is this level of inner loneliness normal for the beginning of grad school? I tend to be a very emotional person who thinks very deeply about things so maybe that's all it is if there is a difference from the norm.

"Stigma surrounding accommodation. Tl;dr at bottom, sorry for formatting issues, am on mobile device. I posted a bit back about my diagnosis of serotonin syndrome. Essentially, my dose of SSRI was increased and I experienced extremely negative physical symptoms for a month before being diagnosed. They immediately took me off the SSRI. Now that the SS symptoms have dissipated, I’m now experiencing severe panic and depression. My psychiatrist is currently treating me for comorbidity (panic disorder, bipolar 2, depression, and OCD). I’m a third year. I’ve designed several experiments I am genuinely excited to get underway and am working to get them set up. When I started my PhD, it was expected that students pass their qualifying exams by the end of their 3rd year. When the cohort that came in behind me started, those conditions changed and they have to pass the exam by the end of their second year. Because of my physical/mental issues, I am having cognitive issues. I can’t focus for long periods of time. It was suggested by the director of graduate students that I seek an accommodation. My psychiatrist also agrees, and says it will take months to get me back to stable. He is going to write an accommodation asking that I receive extra time on assignments (meaning my qualifier and a seminar presentation), and perhaps the ability to use notes for these. In the meantime I’m attending seminars, have been able to get back to research, and am fulfilling my TA duties. I’m still working on my qualifier, albeit at a slower pace than I was before the SS. But I’m watching my cohort and the second years scheduling and passing their qualifying exams. There have been whispers around the department that I’m not well (other students noticed my shaking and inability to carry on conversations, as well as being out quite a bit during the month I dealt with SS). I’m so embarrassed that things have gotten to this point. I feel like a hassle to my committee members and I’m worried they’ll judge me for not getting my qualifier done at the same time as everyone else. I feel incompetent because everyone else is passing and defending their qualifiers, and it may take me longer. I fear what my cohort is going to say and think about me when I haven’t passed and they have. I’m worried about the stigma surrounding my need for accommodations. I don’t want to face anyone because I spontaneously burst into tears. I’ve been hiding away in the darkest corner of the library chipping slowly away at my qualifier. I’m working weekends in the lab because I’m embarrassed to face my colleagues. *I’m still pushing through despite everything.* I can’t take a leave of absence because I’m the breadwinner in our household and have 2 kids to support. My advisor has been very understanding about all of this and I’ve been proactive and open and honest with how I’m progressing on my qualifier and research, and he’s okay with it. It’s the rest of the department that I’m worried about. Tl;dr: I have had mental illness for years that was managed but have now declined to a debilitating state.

"Student forum. student forum is a structured platform—physical or digital—where students gather to discuss issues that matter to them. These can include academic concerns, extracurricular activities, campus policies, mental health, diversity, and more. Forums may be officially recognized by educational institutions or run independently by student groups. Why Student Forums Matter 1. Promoting Student Voice Student forums empower individuals to express their opinions, offer feedback, and influence decisions that impact their education and daily life. They provide a channel between students and teaching staff or administration, helping to shape a more inclusive and responsive educational environment. 2. Encouraging Collaboration Forums foster a spirit of teamwork. Students from diverse backgrounds come together to discuss common interests, debate important issues, and propose solutions to campus challenges. This encourages tolerance, understanding, and unity. 3. Developing Leadership and Communication Skills Active participation in a student forum helps students build essential life skills. Leading a discussion, presenting an idea, or organizing an event hones communication, critical thinking, and leadership—skills that are invaluable beyond the classroom. 4. Creating a Supportive Community Student forums often evolve into safe spaces where students feel heard, supported, and respected. In such environments, mental health topics, academic stress, and social concerns can be addressed without judgment, fostering a sense of belonging. Online Forums: A Modern Shift In the digital age, online student forums have become increasingly popular. Platforms like Discord, Reddit, Microsoft Teams, or school-specific discussion boards allow students to engage from anywhere, at any time. These forums are especially helpful for distance learners or students with busy schedules. Making the Most of a Student Forum Be Respectful: Value others’ opinions, even if they differ from your own. Healthy debate is encouraged, but respect is key. Stay Informed: Participate in discussions that are meaningful and relevant. Research topics before contributing. Be Active: Don’t just observe—engage! Ask questions, suggest ideas, and attend meetings or events. Conclusion Student forums are more than just platforms for discussion—they are engines of change, creativity, and connection. Whether you're looking to share your thoughts, find support, or make a difference on campus, getting involved in a student forum is a step toward becoming an active, informed, and empowered member of your academic community",Faculty,Medium,1.0,reddit:r/students,Medium,1,2612,366,6,Student forum.,0

"Recovering from prestige whoring is a lifelong endeavor. Hi - I came to this forum because a LinkedIn dude I follow mentioned that an Asian kid literally killed himself on Ivy day because blah blah. So I’ve spent the day commenting on posts here to try to bring an adult perspective other than your parents’… Regardless, none of it is worth *that*, I hope we can all agree. I’m a middle aged guy working a decently prestigious job in a decently prestigious tech-related career making a decent six figure salary, with a family and kids and all that jazz. I went to Chicago, Cal, Harvard. I went to a public magnet school. I had Asian immigrant parents who did that whole thing. I’m an elder millennial. I am semi addicted to TikTok. When I was in high school, all I ever did was fight for points on exams and hw. I took nearly double digit APs, was ranked roughly third in my high school, did the advanced math at CC, but was utter shit at my ECs, but…somehow managed to get into a decent school. My dream was two-fold: to get far away from the cloistered Little Asia that was my suburb; and to begin a real intellectual life, not dictated solely by points and test scores. I did that. It was a small part of what I did in college, generally, as a person. I then went on to get my doctorate. In applying for grad school, I basically aced my GREs, but I knew by then that the metrics that I operated by in high school were utterly meaningless out there where the rubber hits the road — where cutting edge research actually means that; where publishing in serious journals wasn’t a testing game or a resume game. But also where things were *still* a large matter of just luck. I failed becoming a serious academic. I think the only thing that could have changed that are two things, one of which I couldn’t control: (1) growing up in a household of academics in the same field, going to, say, some elite private school in NY where their high school courses just are the college courses I was taking in the first couple of years of college, having the interest in all of that at the same time, and being able to network as an academic (a hyper specialized skill probably not teachable or only teachable by said parents), and (2) not being an undiagnosed adhd kid who had no grit. Nobody growing up was telling me I should have been optimizing to avoid (2). I was only ever taught things that made me envy not having (1). But I got my PhD. Cuz checking off marks and scores and certs is in my fucking DNA. It ain’t a big deal. And I purposefully tested into HLS, cuz at that point I didn’t know wtf to do with myself cuz…see above re no grit. I just knew that I could test. So I aced my LSATs. Where am I now? I’m a recovering addict, in some ways. Recovering from measuring my self worth in those terms. Recovering from setting my goals using external metrics or markers. None of that matters. What mattered more than any of the above story was the story about how I stopped being a total piece of shit in arguments, how I worked through relationships and heartbreak, how I grieved who I never could be, how I am finding my way figuring out why work even matters, how much I regret not spending more time on what matters, and so much more. Much more you can’t even predict, much more you don’t know you don’t know, but much more you *can* be *open* to. Anyway, my degrees opened *some* doors for me, *sort of*, though in a *pretty haphazard and random* way. The vast majority of ppl I know with roughly the same amount of “success,” looking back, would say basically the same. They’re all saying this to you over and over again for the very simple reason that it’s just true. The world is a terrible, unfair place, and getting terribler and terribler by the minute, and you have almost no say in it. Especially so the poorer your environment has been. That’s what you should be facing up to; that’s what you should be figuring out how you are going to survive, and with a giant dosage of luck, maybe even how to change. And you can’t do that by fucking killing yourself, of course, but also I am guessing you can’t do it by doing some other things that seem common in these parts…",Academic,Medium,1.0,web:pullpush:r/ApplyingToCollege:submission:unfair,Medium,1,4176,783,0,Recovering from prestige whoring is a lifelong endeavor.,0

"Debating switching my major, any advice. So currently I’m attending a small (ish) university known for its liberal arts program and I’m majoring in screenwriting. Now, this isn’t one of the top film schools- it’s not known for its connections, though it has them, and connections is what film is all about. I’d like to write for television, but particularly I’d like to write for animated television- my own shows. But alongside being a screenwriter I’m also an artist, I have been for a very very long time. When I first applied to this university, I was incredibly torn between screenwriting and animation and, in a snap decision, I chose screenwriting. The issue now- I REALLY enjoy drawing, more so than writing I think. I’ve found myself drawing consistently during this school year for fun, I have not been doing the same with writing. Were I to switch to an animation major I could minor in screenwriting and have not taken very many wasted classes at all. If I stay majoring in screenwriting, there is not a minor for animation. But at the same time, it feels like switching my major is somehow proof of me admitting some kind of defeat. I never swore to anybody I’d make it as a big-time screenwriter, but I always swore to myself I would “prove everybody wrong”. I know nobody cares about my major that much, they won’t see it as me admitting to anything except that I prefer art over writing, but still I feel like I’m betraying someone- myself, my professors, my family, somebody. I’m only a freshman so I haven’t gone all in on any one major yet, though I have more than other freshman due to my CCP classes getting transferred- it wouldn’t push my graduation back or anything like that. But still, I don’t know what to do. I’m completely torn over this decision. Is one a better choice career-wise? (I know liberal arts in general are a bad choice career-wise, but comparing the two). Am I more likely to get internships in one than in the other? How do I get over these feelings of inadequacy over just my deliberation of the idea?

"No - I do not respond to cold calls from highschool students. Still, I have 2 HS interns in my lab every summer. They are part of a program run by my university for local students. The program does all the vetting, hiring and placement, and pays the students for their 'work' over the summer to reduce the equity issues around asking senior high-school students to give up a summer of paid labour. Although the application doesn't ask about it, the program recruits from schools with high first-nation populations. (No - I'm not in the US) The program runs twice-weekly seminars on 'how to study at university', 'how behave/communicate professionally', and other topics which can be really hard to communicate to students because their expectations and experience are so limited. My lab also receives a small stipend for participating that I use to pay the grad student whose project they are 'helping' on -because the grad student is taking on a lot of additional labour and highschool students very rarely get to the point where the work they produce is unequivocally worth the time we put in. Both the grad student and I get short training and templates to help onboard and communicate expectations to highschool students.

"Bad advisor relationship. I am a first year PhD student who joined a lab with an RA immediately upon being accepted to my program. I have two PhD advisors. One is based in the UK, the other is a professor at the school I am attending in the US. My UK advisor is pretty absent save for our weekly lab meetings and rarely responds to emails unless it is an absolute emergency, which I give a pass because of the time difference. My US-based advisor lives 5 minutes from campus, but refuses to return because of COVID safety (which, fine. He’s old and at-risk). I met him once during my interview before lockdown happened. At first, he was open, friendly, and helpful. For example, he and the UK-based advisor were extremely gracious when I asked for time away from the lab due to mental health concerns. However, recently his attitude seems to have soured. He has started nit-picking me in almost every interaction, which I may be biased about, but it is really starting to get to me. For example, he derided my “time-management skills” over zoom and across three separate emails for an incident that I didn’t have control over and was not impacted by my “poor time management.”The organism was processed and I made it to my lecture in time. Then, he sent several emails about my lack of communication skills. In my defense, he sends several paragraph-long emails that are a mix of rambling, insults, and back-and-forth with my UK advisor (they specialize in two different areas, so they rarely agree about best course of action), giving me intense anxiety about communicating with him. When I ask him for help prepping for future experiments, I get extremely long emails that usually include “helpful” tangents about how grad students need to be independent. For example, I asked how he built a field trap that he wanted me to replicate. I asked about how he drilled the pieces, how he secured them together, etc. I have little to no woodworking experience and thought these were simple questions. Nope. I got a diatribe that I need to “work on my problem solving skills” and no answer about the woodworking aspect. This is the same person who micromanaged the entire process of building the first field trap, down to the width of the drill bit used, for four months and then scrapped my design in favor of the one he wants me to replicate. I apologize if these issues sound minor, but they are really starting to get to me. I joined with lab for the RA because it sounded exciting and they had a research plan laid out. It is so poorly managed that we haven’t had our study organism for the nine months I’ve been here. I am rarely given guidance or training, just told to figure it out along with long rants about what it “means” to be a grad student. I have also heard through other members that it must be “my turn” to receive his ire. The pattern of behavior I’m experiencing now gives me a bad feeling about how I will be treated later.

"Should I ask for an Incomplete. Some context: i'm a first-year transfer student at a small liberal arts college in the USA. when I first transferred, I declared my major as psychology. This semester, I realized it wasn't a great fit and changed majors. By that point, it was too late to change my schedule, so I was stuck with mostly Psych courses, including two 3000 courses. My mental health has never been great, but it's gotten really bad since the beginning of fall semester. I have frequent panic attacks, often in public. I started skipping class early in the semester when I felt one coming on. Stupidly, I never reached out to my professors to explain this because I thought the panic attacks would let up after some lifestyle changes. Of course, they got worse. I've attended class four times in the past 3 weeks because I'm so afraid of having a panic attack in public (it's really embarrassing and traumatic). On both of the days that I managed to go to class, I did end up having those public panic attacks, reinforcing my fear. I've managed to catch up in my easier classes, but I'm still way behind in those 3000 level courses. To be honest, I have always been kind of avoidant of these classes because they make me the most anxious (difficulty + certain people in them). Neither of them have final exams, but I am much more than 3 weeks behind in terms of projects. At this point, I haven't even bothered to catch up because I know there's no way I'll get everything done in time. A friend suggested I ask those professors for an Incomplete grade so I can get my work done over the summer. Is this a good idea, or do you think I'll get shut down?

I'd start the general research for the literature review as soon as I got the assignment. A lot of the time, at least some of what I need is in a published book, not held by my university, so they need to do an inter-library transfer, which in itself can take two weeks or more. Meanwhile I assemble journal articles, using the university library's journal access. When I get the books, I read through them for relevant material. Then I develop an outline; this will take a couple of weeks. I make sure to correctly cite each piece of information I use to make up the outline, so I don't have to go hunting for citations when I write the paper, and I develop my ""final"" bibliography/reference list at this time.

So I emailed my professor telling her my situation and asked for an extra day to complete to quiz so I can use my desktop when I get home on Saturday. She responded simply by telling me to go to a library. However, library computers do not have webcams and I was not allowed to install the software in the first place and she stopped responding to my emails until today when she said I would not be allowed a quiz extension according to the syllabus. I feel like this is very unfair when there was absolutely no indication anywhere that my technology would cause an issue and she never provided a practice quiz to test our technology before the actual quiz which is only open for 24 hours. Should I escalate this?

"Its really your decision to be honest. My dream for college is to have attended my current University start to finish in the on-campus housing (first two years are dorms, next two are campus apartments). Also a full ride. But, some really don't like the dorms. I have done both so I can talk about it a decent bit. The dorms were nice because I was always so close to campus. The farthest walk was 15 minutes, and that was for a building on the waaaaay outskirts of campus that I never have to go to regularly. Most walks are about 5-10 minutes and it made attending class and events so much easier. It made me feel like I was really at college and involved with my campus. Also, not having to worry about fokd was nice because of the meal plans. Then I lived in an off-campus apartment 15 minutes away. My class attendance and event attendance dropped heavily, but I felt like I had more of a home. It was tougher since I need to work to pay for the apartment and other things so it always felt like even though I had more ""freedom"" I actually ended up with less time to do anything. Now, I live 25 minutes from campus. My attendance is back up, but its a lot harder. I have to drive 25 minutes one way, and walk 10 minutes to class. That means I have 70 minutes of straight commuting. It also means that I either spend no time on campus or no time home. Lastly, I got a dog pretty early into having my apartment (none of the apartments are affiliated with the school.) Since then, I am virtually never on campus other than for my actual classes and when I have time to do an event I have been interested in. It really depends on what you like. Personally, the dorm life always made me more engaged in my learning and the events that I am still paying for.

"Balancing class/coursework and research. Hi. This is a popular question among graduate students and it's something that I'm really struggling to figure out for myself. I'm curious of what everyone else in the community does in order to balance out coursework and research. Just for some background, I'm a second semester MSCS student who does research in ML. I've been trying really hard to get a ""work life balance,"" but it just seems a bit overwhelming when the ""work"" part of it is overwhelming. It just seems impossible to stick to a schedule to completely stay up-to-date with classes (i.e., fully understanding the material up until the current lecture and also reviewing for the next) because studying takes so damn long (maybe it shouldn't and I'm the weird one). On the other side of things, I'm trying to get my own independent research going on. I've been fortunate enough to take part in projects that have resulted in two publications, but I'm not the first author for either of them (I can't speak for other fields, but in ML author order is contribution order). I want to get my own research project going as well, but that in itself is a monstrous task. This is especially important because I'm planning on applying to PhD programs abroad this year or next (I'm from Korea). Since I'm also going to be applying, I need to maintain a good GPA. This absolutely sucks during times when I have final exams and I'm due to submit a paper to a venue that same week (that's this week and I'm dying). How do you balance things out, and if you're past the coursework phase of graduate life did you have a trick or schedule you stick to? One of the seniors who I worked with plans out his day according to time slots. For example, from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. he'll watch an online lecture or study for something on his own, and from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. he'd work on coding etc. I've tried this, but even the smaller tasks seem to take a long time and it seemed infeasible to continuously break the flow of things. Maybe this will get better with time, but it's how it is now. I'd appreciate any anecdotes or tips that you guys can think of.

"I thought I was just lazy, but turns out I was just mentally paralyzed. Anyone else feel this. Real talk, for the longest time, I thought I was just a lazy student. Like, I’d open my laptop, stare at my notes, and just… freeze. Total brain fog. I actually wanted to study, no cap, but I’d end up closing everything because I was so overwhelmed AF. I kept hearing the same old advice: “Just be disciplined,” “Just sit down and do it.” But honestly, that just made me feel worse. The problem wasn’t my effort; it was the sheer mental overload. Too many tabs open in my brain, too many deadlines fighting for attention. I was mentally paralyzed, not lazy. The game changer for me was realizing I needed a system to reduce the confusion, not more motivation. I stopped trying to force myself to work and started fixing the mess that was blocking me. Things didn’t get easy, but they became manageable. That one shift in perspective was everything. I wrote down the whole process how I went from being totally stuck to finally having clarity in a short guide. It’s not some guru advice; it’s just notes from someone who was in the trenches and figured out a few things.

"Looking to make a change, and for some guidance. When I first started my undergrad, I hated university. Over time, I grew to love it, especially as I began to take courses outside the prerequisites in history, which I found invigorating. My grades improved considerably as a result, and over time I found a place where I truly enjoyed what I was doing. I had always liked history, but I found the academic application of it a great excitement. I ended up doing an Honours thesis in my final year. What I did not do was apply to an MA in History. The reason for this was because I tried to be a rational person. I wanted to avoid the horror stories of people with history degrees struggling to find jobs, so I ended up applying to a professional graduate program instead. I ended up in a Master of Public Administration program, only to find that I hated it. I found no fulfillment or joy in the material or in the environment, even if the people I am studying with are all wonderful. For the first time since my third semester of undergrad, I dreaded going to university. So, about halfway through, I decided to give myself some options, and I ended up applying for an MA in History. This is what I had wanted to do in the first place. I have not withdrawn from the MPA program yet, and am waiting to hear back from my applications. If I was to complete the MA, I have no illusions about going on in academia for a PhD or a job given the horrible job market for academic historians right now. There are many other doors that an MA could open, even if the journey to get there may be a bit more long-winded than that with an MPA. I am mainly making this post looking for some advice. I am hoping that some of you may have been in similar positions in the past, and could tell me of your experiences",Examination,Low,0.0,web:reddit:r/gradschool:new,Low,0,1797,342,5,"Looking to make a change, and for some guidance.",0

"Took a gap year after getting rejected everywhere and it was the best thing that happened to me. Last year I was that kid who got rejected or waitlisted everywhere despite having decent stats. 3.8 GPA, 1480 SAT, good ECs, but something just didn't click. Watching everyone celebrate acceptances while I had nothing was probably the lowest point of my life. Parents wanted me to go to community college but I decided to take a gap year and reapply. Not gonna lie, explaining this to people was embarrassing at first. Everyone assumes you're a failure if you don't go straight to college. But looking back, that rejection was a gift. During my gap year I worked at a startup, volunteered teaching coding to kids, traveled solo for two months on money I saved, and actually figured out what I want to study. My first applications were all over the place because I didn't know myself. This time I had real experiences to write about and genuine passion for my major. The work experience was huge. Not only did I make money but I finally understood what I actually want from college. Sitting in meetings with people who had degrees made me realize what skills I needed. My essays went from theoretical to concrete. Instead of ""I want to study computer science because I like problem solving"" I could write about actual projects I built and problems I solved. Also learned that admissions officers actually respect gap years if you do something meaningful. Several schools specifically asked about it in interviews and seemed impressed. One interviewer said it showed maturity and self-awareness that most 18 year olds don't have. Results were completely different this time. Got into 7 out of 11 schools including my current school which had rejected me the first time. Same grades, same test scores, but completely different person. The social thing everyone worries about isn't real. Nobody cares that you're a year older. If anything, being more mature makes college easier. I'm not stressed about fitting in or finding myself because I already did that. If you're facing rejection this year, consider a gap year. Not as a failure but as an opportunity to become who you're supposed to be before college, not during it",Examination,Medium,1.0,web:reddit:r/college:new,Medium,1,2216,378,5,Took a gap year after getting rejected everywhere and it was the best thing that happened to me.,0

"Creepy Guy on My Floor and Literally No One is Concerned. Hi everyone! I’m sorry if this is a bit of a bother but I’m hoping to get some advice as a first time student living on campus. There is a guy “Sam” living on my dorm floor who acts in a very creepy way towards some of the students (mostly girls) and no one seems concerned, even two women who get the brunt of it. And our RA has said she can’t really do much about the situation. I’m not scared, but the whole situation makes me uncomfortable and really pissed off tbh. Whenever someone is nice to him he kind of attaches himself to them. If he sees you in the dining hall he will walk over, sit down, and talk at you literally as long as you let him. He talks constantly, always makes the conversation about himself and his interests, doesn’t pick up on any social cues, and will interrupt anything you’re doing or a conversation you were having with someone else. He rants a lot about how he doesn’t like people, thinks he’s smarter than others, and complains. He also apparently has a girlfriend, but he said he doesn’t like her because she’s too needy but doesn’t want to break up with her. So he’s not like a nice just socially unaware dude. I’ve heard that one time he followed a woman up to her dorm, talked to her constantly the whole time, and tried to walk into it with her before she closed the door in his face saying she had to get ready. Another person (nb) Sam saw in a building and he apparently blocked them in a stairwell to talk until they shoved past and said they have to go to class, which made them late. This same person had their dinner interrupted while they were with their parents during family weekend and their dad had to ask him to go away. They genuinely thought he was going to sit down next to them. Recently my roommate “Maria” seems like the next person as he’s been attached to and I got to meet him when he randomly sat down at our table, didn’t introduce himself and talk at us. I faked a phone call (texted a friend to call through my Apple Watch) and she claimed that it was because there was an emergency. He followed her up to the dorm, talked the whole time, and didn’t seem to care that she was acting like she really needed to leave to help someone. I walked up and he was in our dorm (!) still talking to her (he was asking if everything was okay at least) while she was frantically pretending to get car keys and a backpack together. I immediately told her we needed to go and told him that sorry but we could talk later and shooed him out. Later I was like okay WTF was that about and was super pissed off and she explained what I posted. This has gotten to be super stressful for Maria and she’s started to walk to a different dining hall farther away so she doesn’t run into him. I don’t think she isn’t scared of him just exhausted and annoyed. Maria won’t officially complain or report him because she said it won’t do anything. This is my first time in a dorm but it’s her second semester. I’m almost 22 (way closer to his age) and she’s like 19 so I feel protective but I’m not as aware of how this all works as her so I’m at a lost on what to do. Our RA knows about his behavior but can’t do anything for the following reasons: He’s not stalking as it’s all coincidental meetings, it’s not sexual harassment because he does it to any gender and has never overtly hit on anyone, and it’s not regular harassment because it’s all a bunch of random people he sees coincidentally. We’re also pretty sure it has to do with Autism or something similar so she doesn’t want to accidentally discriminate against him or encourage bullying/targeted isolation. Which I think is probably why most people just stick it out too. I think that it’s not an excuse and someone needs to privately talk to him, not that people need to confront him. And I necessarily don’t want to confront for the potential discrimination, and also in case getting him mad or making him aware that people find him uncomfortable escalates his behavior in anyway. Plus I’m an average height/size woman, and he is a much taller and physically fit man so I’m obviously avoiding being any sort of antagonist is his brain if that’s the case. But he does have a male roommate, and from what I’ve heard the guy avoids him and staying in the dorm as much as possible. He keeps earbuds in while they’re 24/7. Sam hates him. I’m about ready to track the guy down (the girl from way earlier has seen him and could point him out) and ask him to talk to Sam, but I’m worried that would be just as bad for that guy considering they live together. I don’t think anyone’s keeping documentation about any of this and everyone seems like it’s just a weird guy to avoid and acts like it’s normal? I don’t know what to do and I’m stressed and angry and confused. I’ve never been a confrontational person before this. Literally any advice would be welcome, even if you genuinely think I should stick it out and avoid him too",Hostel,High,2.0,web:pullpush:r/college:submission:harassment,High,2,4979,939,9,Creepy Guy on My Floor and Literally No One is Concerned.,0
"To remove someone of leadership from a class/organization. We are a student organization (band) that is 300+. I am in a section that is about 40 people. Out of these 40ish people, 30 of them are willing to sign a petition to remove an individual that was promoted to student staff out of marching program. There was a sexual harassment case against this person and the university ended up dropping allegations after 7 months from the incident. There was two incidents, he showed up someone’s house uninvited and asked to come in. (Presumably he followed her home because an address was not shared. ) Another where he touched someone inappropriately in a crowd. ( the argument the school made was it may have happened unintentionally ) Other small instances include overt staring and walking behind females at night after practice but this is proof of how he makes others uncomfortable. This is a gray area, I personally believe he is autistic. Other people disagree but as someone with relatives who are on the spectrum, I can recognize it. Personally, I don’t want him on staff, after the allegations, the uncomfortableness, and his lack skill - everyone agrees it would be best. Others, particularly the victims removed from the program. What should we do? Would a petition work? Any victory would boost morale in the section.

"I’d be grateful if someone reviewed my SoP. The first time I truly understood the weight of engineering choices was while working on a system where a single incorrect line of logic could result in someone losing access to public healthcare benefits. That experience, early in my time at Deloitte, shaped how I approach software development and influenced the direction I want my career to grow into. I became interested in computers early on because they respond well to experimentation. Unlike subjects that require a lot of memorizations, computers felt intuitive. I could try things out, learn by doing, and apply logic to complete tasks I had never attempted before. This curiosity led me to pursue a bachelor’s degree in information technology, where my interest deepened when I studied data structures and algorithms. Breaking down complex problems and finding efficient solutions felt rewarding and gave me a strong analytical foundation for my future endeavors. As I advanced academically, I realized that my three-year undergraduate degree was not enough for the depth of engineering I wanted to achieve. So, I decided to pursue a Master of Computer Applications, focusing on practical system development. During my MCA, I shifted from solving isolated issues to building complete systems. I developed a memory-matching game using MERN stack, which went live on campus and was actively used by students. This experience introduced me to real users and showed me how backend logic, reliability, and concurrency directly influence system performance. It also sparked a lasting interest in system design and large-scale application development, which I carried into my professional work. At Deloitte, I have worked on backend systems for Medicaid eligibility determination for a U.S. state. I helped develop a Java-based Business Rules Engine and built Spring Batch pipelines for large-scale, policy-driven computations. My work included decision-table parsing, rule-execution flows, and automation logic for monthly eligibility processing under several government programs. Through these projects, my contributions resulted in over $11 million in measurable client savings while ensuring people received accurate benefits. Working on these systems made the connection between correctness, accountability, and real-world impact very clear to me. As I took on more responsibility, I recognized the limitations of purely rule-based systems, especially when faced with incomplete or unpredictable data. This realization led me to explore AI-driven approaches. At Deloitte’s internal AI Hackathon, I helped design a childcare interview shortlisting platform and was responsible for the overall system architecture. While my teammates focused on different parts of the project, I stayed involved by reviewing designs, answering technical questions, and keeping the team organized under tight deadlines. Additionally, I explored AI-based proctoring ideas, such as background-noise detection and eye-movement tracking, to reduce malpractice during interviews, using Python-based machine learning and computer-vision techniques. This experience reinforced my belief that collaborative problem-solving leads to better outcomes, and our work was recognized with a category award. I also independently led a client-facing GenAI correspondence modernization proof of concept. The goal was to shift from document-heavy communication to a video-based format that was easier for end users to understand. This project gave me early exposure to integrating learning-based techniques into production workflows and emphasized the importance of designing systems that are not only correct but also accessible and user-friendly. My work at Deloitte has earned me multiple internal awards, and I have been placed on a fast-track promotion path within two years, which is earlier than the usual three to four. I see these recognitions as signs of trust to take ownership, guide others, and deliver reliably in complex, high-stakes environments. My intellectual interests now focus on the intersection of distributed systems and artificial intelligence. I want to understand how learning-based models can fit into large-scale systems while maintaining correctness, reliability, and accountability. These questions arise from the limitations I have seen in rule-based systems used at scale. (Here Ill include a university specific para) Looking forward, I want to contribute to top-tier organizations by helping design and develop efficient, reliable, and cost-effective software that adds real value to many people. Additionally, I want to explore the power of AI and Machine Learning in depth and how they can work in cohesion with the technologies I develop.

"Why is figuring out your grade so hard. I cannot tell you how many students have told me it is unfair that they cannot see their grades. When.

I am a fast grader who is fortunate enough to have TA assistance and they get grades and feedback always in 4 days or less. Nope, the grades are there. They add up to 1000 points. The class is relatively large, so there's no grade for attendance/participation. All they need to do is literally add up the numbers and divide (and yes, I'm always happy to furnish the current total possible.though they could add that up from what is visible).

"This is a post for students struggling. If you are struggling in school socially or academically: this is for you. College was hell for me. I 23f just recently graduated. I went to a tiny liberal arts school in a rural area. I had a difficult time transitioning into academics pulling a 1.5 GPA my first semester. Then, my very best friends (around 14 girls) all turned against me because I was sexually assaulted by one of their friends and they didn’t believe me. I was harassed constantly with rumors and hatred - even having people come up to me asking me where my baby was (i was never pregnant) and saying “oh, you didn’t kill yourself?” I drew away from people and turned into somewhat of a nerd, spending my days wrapped up in schoolwork and books. This turned me into an incredible academic scoring a 3.8 GPA for my last few semesters, but I was insatiably lonely. I’m currently in a competitive graduate school with a 13% acceptance rate. My career has so much in store for me. My point is, I hated every second of college. It changed me forever as a person. I will never look at anyone the same, and my circle will remain very small. I spent every second trying to leave, to escape the same faces I saw every single time I set foot on the icy snow, to which I surprisingly succeeded. I spent only 3 semesters on-campus studying. I did 3 semesters during COVID online from home and transferred 2 in from other universities that I did online. But I made it. I DID it. You can too, I promise. Keep pushing, keep going. I just graduated this December and minutes ago sent my request to pull myself from the graduation ceremony. I will have my diploma sent to my home. And I can honestly say, it feels so good to finally close the chapter on the absolute worst and seemingly never-ending 4.5 years of my life. I feel as though I can breathe once again, knowing I will never have to face the cold brick walls and bare desks that were my friend for many years. I had an awful experience. But I came out of it. I learned from it. I grew from it. And now I am on a path towards an incredibly successful career. I have never seen such a post on Reddit before, so I wanted to make this. If I had seen anyone else post something like this I think it may have been a small light at the end of a seemingly endless dark tunnel. Many students commit suicide every year, thankfully I never went through with my antagonizing thoughts, but if you are in that place - it will be over soon, I promise. Wake up, go to class, do what you need to do, and then when you’re done… leave it behind in the rear-view.

BAS degree to grad school? Plus low gpa? 😅. Hi all! I just got into the bachelors of applied science in supervision and management at my local college. I am unsure if I will be able to apply to graduate school with a bachelors of applied science? the only reason I'm attending is this was financially the best college for me to be in. I also need advice about my GPA. I got my AA and graduated with a 2.8 But when I got into the bachelors it automatically dropped to a 2.5. I have not taken bachelor degree classes yet. I do have 60 credits remaining will be be possible to get a 3.0 or 3.2? I had health issues my first two years of college. I stopped going then went back and got my AA.

"Course based masters targeting international students. Course based programmes targeting mature students looking to skill up. Ideally but not required is to have there be something like an advanced training for mid career people looking to up skill. This is tough because a lot of universities don't do that kind of thing, but have chairs and deans and admin people teach courses on well, executive leadership and planning combined with technical skills and regulatory compliance. Have the IT security people make content on the current threat environment and best practices, the hr people on the latest rules and regulations, that sort of thing. Coop where you charge fees for coop/job hunting. Renting out university space or equipment. In the summer we apparently make a killing on a knitting club. Yes, really. Other more practical options might include large venues as performance spaces, grid computing with the on campus infrastructure, organized nature walk events, whatever your campus has. Find a way to make use of and charge for residences in the summer. This could be summer courses(see also course based masters targeting international students), but could also be summer enrichment for secondary students or the elderly. Pay current students to run the enrichment. Establish a campus office to employ students for subject specific employment you contract out to people. E.g. A company needs some software testers for a month? We can wrangle that up out of our cs/swe students. The uni then gets a cut of the revenue basically. Aggressively reach out to community partners about joint research opportunities that can involve students. The partner can pay for the students/use of university space/equipment. Offer up campuses for remote work or as temporary facilities to local employers looking to expand or refurbish offices or the like. You need actually working space not lecture rooms though. Few if any of these are actually good ideas for the instituon as a whole but if you are desperate for money to pay the bills, you need to think about what an instituon can do as a businesses with the space and facilities it has.

"I had a bad experience with my professor and am trying to fill out the survey. Are my complaints fair. I'm not active in this sub much and I'm not sure what flair to use. Here's the situation, I'm in online school and my professor for the class I just finished was horrible, I took a course that is important to my field of study and I am honestly really upset about her lack of professionalism and just effort at all. She barely spoke 5 sentences to me (including in homework feedback) and gave me a C on an assignment with no explanation the first week of class. I'll write what I'm planning to send in for my review of the professor (the school emails one out after classes end). I may be being overly sympathetic here but I feel bad complaining about her when she's a human being who was generally nice (although vague and ignored me for most of the class) and is also just trying to survive so I don't want to be too harsh or dramatic. If you can let me know your opinions on what I plan to say based on the situation I would really appreciate it. Sorry for the heavy preface, here's what I wrote: There was little to no feedback at all on any assignments, nothing but ""thank you"" most of the time. I feel like I would have learned the exact same amount through a completely digitized course as the professor was barely involved in any learning. We all got the exact same responses on our discussion posts, usually just saying ""Thank you"" again. People's questions to her in discussions didn't get answered for weeks at least and I don't think ever got answered on the boards, I stopped going back to check after a while. I gave up on getting answers to my questions through email, she never answered them all and only every picking one or two questions out of however many I clearly and repetitively asked even after getting my advisor involved. It took at least a week to get a response and sometimes longer. I asked a question about response posts from our first discussion and after at least 7 emails back and forth between us (I stopped counting since it's a short course and we had already reached finals) that she never really answered. I am extremely disappointed because I was looking forward to this class and the impact it would have on my career; I was planning to ask questions to further my learning but couldn't because I couldn't even get an answer to basic homework and grading questions. In the final discussion posts, many people stated that they barely got any feedback throughout the course, confirming that I was not the only one experiencing these issues. I would not take another class with this professor and I hope future classes are better for other students.

"My lab partner tried to cheat off me and I reported it. This is chemistry class, we have a graded lab that we're allowed and encouraged to help each other on but explicitly told to not copy each others' answers. Part of the questions are from the textbook and online lecture videos prior to that day's lab. Well, today we had a more complicated section (electron configurations and line diagrams, for the curious) and when we got to it my lab partner simply waited expectantly to copy my answers. I asked her if she had watched the lecture prior to class and she said she hadn't. She then asked me how to go about answering the question, which, well, you have to learn a lot in order to do so. I pulled out my notes from lecture and showed her what format the answer might look similar to from a different element. She was like ""yeah I had that in a previous class"" and then instead of starting on the problem, she again waited expectantly for me to start writing the answer. I said, ""Look, this is a lengthy and complex answer and I'm not comfortable with you just copying what I write"". ""Yeah, no of course"" she replies.and then continues to wait expectantly, watching my pencil, her own poised to copy me. So then I took my binder and used it to block her view, and began tackling the problem. About 15 seconds later she packed up her things. I tried to keep my tone light asking her ""you heading out?"" And she was all ""Yeah I guess I'll find someone else to help me"" and left in a huff. I didn't use the word ""cheating"" when I spoke with my professor privately about it, but I did explain fully what happened and they were like ""yeah that would be cheating"" and said they'd talk to her about it. I was pretty shook up afterwards; it just caught me off guard. Has anyone else gone through something similar? I'm dreading seeing her next class. I liked her and thought we got along well, but I have no idea how to navigate from this breach of trust, not just socially but academically. Do I request a different lab partner, despite everyone else in class already being paired up? I'm especially concerned to sit next to her during exams because we're allowed a handwritten sheet for exams and I'd need to make sure she doesn't copy off of mine.

"My colleagues were unfairly given higher grades which resulted in my rank slipping down? I feel cheated and angry. I was in the last year of my medicine residency course at a University. This was the last examination of my life and I really wanted to stand first as I loved this field. I was expected by everyone to top the exam as I was a bright student and prepared for it very well. It has two parts - a theory and a practical examination. The scoring is then accumulated and ranks are given. I got the highest marks in theory part in which a single professor checks everyone's answer sheets. All the candidates are divided into 5 different centers for the practical examination in which there are a different group of professors at every center. What happened is that at one of the centers the professors gave hilariously high marks to everyone. That meant that due to the practical exam scoring I slipped down to fourth. Even guys who failed the theory examination ended up getting higher marks than us in the practicals at that center. The rest of us in the remaining 4 centers were graded fairly. I know it's not the end of the world but yeah I feel a bit down. I would not have been sour about it if someone really deserved those marks but this leniency at the other center hurts me. It was just their luck that they were alloted to that particular center and ended up having an unfair advantage.

"I Need Advice - Computer Science Student. Hello, I'm in my fourth semester of computer science, so far I am doing well, I participated in hackathons and others, but this week they were my partials and on the first day I had one of programming the course of algorithms and data structure, I practiced for that exam as usual and I went in and blanked, I do not know if it was my nerves but I never got through to this point, I felt a lot of nerves, the exam lasted 3 hours and I did everything I could. Last question, not as I indicated (there were 3 questions), I feel very nervous, I left very discouraged to such an extent that the next day I had another partial one and I blanked myself.so much so that it already affects 2 of my grades.

Besides, in that exam everyone copied and used AI and it is always like that, I can not simply, it goes against many things but they in the end surpass me in grades and even many are awarded scholarships even if it is unfairly and make you feel bad for not doing that, I just do not know what to do.

Is a gap year a bad idea. I’m in Year 12 right now and my teacher told me I should start getting ready for uni think about what uni I wanna go to and do a bunch of their stuff she was talking about. After talking to my friends about it we decided we should take a gap year. I really need a break because I’m only in Year 12 and I’m soo exhausting it’s crazy I can’t imagining just jumping into another 4 years of uni.

"Worth Emailing my Teacher about my struggles this semester. Sophomore here at a pretty rigorous academic school. So basically my campus opened up for this semester, but all of my classes were online. While I found the previous spring semester to be easier taking classes online from home, I found that was not the case for me when I was at school. With the ongoing pandemic, Wake Forest, like many universities, had a very restrictive campus with little for us students to do. I entered into the semester with some slight bad habits that had developed over the Summer during quarantine/isolation. I had started to smoke more weed than I should, and I had gotten into a minor hole gambling. It was very stressful living with my whole family during this time and these were my ways to cope/feel a sense of excitement. I had gained 15 pounds in 2 months, confidence completely shattered but excited to get on the right track upon returning to school. I came into the semester doing well once I got there. My friends and I motivated each other to do dorm workouts (gym closed) and I had not smoked for awhile. 20 days into it, I got COVID. All of my friends got it. We didnt go to any parties or anything like that, and to put it into perspective there have been 800 confirmed cases out of 7500 students this semester (roughly 10.6% of the student body got it). That COVID process was one of the most poorly handled situation I have ever been apart of. They shipped us off to Best Western Motel rooms where all I had was weed I had brought (I was not going to last 12 days on my own without any, other people brought alcohol. to each their own.), a big bed, and a nice TV. For the next 12 days all I did was smoke, and watch tv/take classes from my Bed. I had regained all of the weight I had lost, and started to become completely disorganized in my online classes. I was not allowed outside once, and was growing extremely depressed. After those 12 days, I returned to campus and could not return to my ways before COVID. My gambling and smoking habits skyrocketed in my time in the BW and I felt very alone and that nobody could relate to what I was going through. I am not one who wants people to feel sorry for me or anything like that, as I know I have great things going on in my life. But it got to the point where I knew it would be ignorant to not acknowledge my struggles. So i called my parents and told them everything in regards to my depression and weed/gambling problems. At the age of 20, I had to admit to myself nobody wants to admit. I had a potentially addictive behavior, depression, anxiety, and needed to get help. This all brings me to where I am today. I am currently at home finishing up this semester. My family has been very supportive of me and I have been going to get professional help. During my struggles, my academics hung by a thread. I finished my first year with a 3.4 but with all that happened this semester I am tracking for a 2.6. That would put me at a 3.15 going into a pivotal semester where I am supposed to be applying for the Business school. When i did the work, I did it well and my grades for those assignments reflect that. However, my virtual theatre class is tanking my grade. I am going to end up with a C in it because I have 2 missing discussions and 3 missing quizzes out of 20. All of my other assignments total up to a 92% for me in the gradebook and it feels so shitty knowing I wont be able to get above a C even with an 100 on the final. The quizzes and discussions were tough because they would be assigned at times in which I did not have a synchronous class, yet they would open at 1 and close at 1:15. During my depressed/Weed fueled state of mind from the end of September to mid November I missed a few of these. I know it is my fault, and do not want to be held at a higher regard as other students but is there anything I can say to my teacher? I have emailed her after missing each of these and she has said something along the lines of ""Oh I do not want it to be unfair to the other students and this assignments only a small part of your grade it shouldnt make a difference"". The problem is they have all added up and made an extreme difference. Would there be any implications of opening up to my professor about these struggles and asking if there was anything I could do? She honestly seems like a very nice and reasonable person, but I would not want to get in trouble with the school in any regards if she forwarded someone higher up the email. UPDATE 12/5: Teacher has been very helpful after opening to her about my struggles. To anyone who this semester has negatively affected mental health wise, do not feel bad for asking for help.

"Tips for starting college if I don't party or even smoke weed (serious question). Hi there pretty soon I will be starting college in a new town I'm moving to this fall for the next semester.

I'm inspired by that because I'm so smart and humble and willing to learn about the human body because I suffer from multiple health conditions like liver disease, kidney disease, hyperthyroidism, etc. I just want to know that, ok, marijuana causes my heart rate to go to dangerous and fatal levels due to my thyroid and heart issues that I've been having, I had a cardiac arrest years ago from smoking a joint and it was a very traumatizing experience, the paramedics had to revive me because my coronary artery's collapsed and I had a massive heart attack and had to have a stent placed in and I'm on beta blockers for the rest of my life even after my surgery all because I smoked weed and my heart couldn't handle it. I've tried explaining it to potheads who have offered me a joint and they've never believed me, and a few have even made fun of me before and ridiculed me. Point being, it seems like from what I've seen with hanging out with my friend from high school on his college campus and things like that is that well over 90% of the students smoke weed or party and I cant do that at all due to my chronic illnesses.

"Hard money positions area gift, stop being tone deaf. Academia has a major problem. We aren't honest ourselves with what actually leads to success. For the most part it isn't who works the hardest, or who is the smartest. It is who is in the right place and the right time. Did you lab hit on a trendy new research area right as you started grad school? Does your lab have the right ""pedigree"" that gets you in the door at the right school? Is a department deciding to focus on what you study at just the right time? Do the politics of hiring happen to align with you rather than against you? The fact that we are not honest about this to ourselves and to trainees is a major disservice. Going off of this, for those of you lucky enough to have hard money positions *recognize what you have is a gift*. I appreciate that all of you are outraged at the current NIH situation. I welcome you in solidarity. The second you start talking about how it is going to impact you though please realize you are completely tone deaf. You will be fine. Most of you don't have any substantial grant funding. Those of you that study very niche topics, or do a lot of social science work, your day to day isn't going to really be impacted.

That progress on neurodegenerative disorders? That next great advance that saves lives? Well all of us that makes that happen, *our worlds are burning down around us*.

"Salaries can be weighted by major as well pretty easily, just normalize it to have a certain proportion of majors in each discipline taken into account. Rate of students going to grad school/jobs after 6 months is heavily important as well, that should be on there and given a lot of weight.

Reputation surveys are completely useless objectively, idk what idiot finds that important. No one can consider those important, it’s just a terrible metric as it’s incredibly subjective and a vague measure. It’s just an excuse for them to randomly skew the results to say what they want. This measure completely makes these rankings useless as USNEWS can at worst just say, “ehh i went here, bump it up 2 spots”, or get paid off or worse, more likely just it would skew the data pretty heavily At minimum to random schools. Diversity, eh, maybe that could be subjectively important, but still at minimum it shouldn’t be weighed as high. Also, graduation rates being weighted so high is dumb. That’s an incredibly unfair metric because some schools are way harder, and schools like Georgia Tech, a lot of people do accelerated masters and graduate in 4 years 1 semester, so it gets dragged down.

"Graduate TA acting as Faculty of Record for freshman nursing simulation — compensation &amp; workload reality check. Hi all — I’m looking for a sanity check from folks familiar with academia, nursing education, or grad TA roles. I’m a graduate student in a nursing program and currently classified/paid as a Graduate Teaching Assistant, but I’m being assigned responsibilities that are more consistent with Faculty of Record. Here’s the setup: * I’m responsible for two sections of a freshman nursing simulation course * Each section meets 2 hours, twice per week (so 4 hours/week of hands-on teaching) * These are first-semester freshmen with no prior exposure to nursing content * The course is newly revamped and undergoing ongoing syllabus/content modifications * I’m responsible for teaching, grading, student communication, prep, and course delivery * I’m listed as Faculty of Record for my sections, though oversight/mentorship exists in theory * I’m capped at 20 hours/week because of my TA appointment Compensation: * $24,000 annual stipend * Full tuition reimbursement * When tuition is included, total compensation is roughly $54,000/year * This is technically a part-time role My internal conflict: I genuinely love teaching and care deeply about supporting these students well — especially since this is their first real nursing course. But simulation courses are labor-intensive, and with course revisions + freshmen needing more support, I’m struggling to see how this realistically fits into a 20-hour cap without either cutting corners or quietly working unpaid hours. My questions: 1. From an academic standpoint — does this sound more like adjunct-level responsibility than a typical grad TA role? 2. From a compensation standpoint — is \~$54k total value (stipend + tuition) reasonable for this level of responsibility if it truly stays part-time, or does that assumption fall apart once workload is considered? 3. Is it common for programs to rely on graduate students as Faculty of Record during course transitions like this? 4. How do people navigate this without burning bridges *or* burning out? Not trying to complain — genuinely trying to understand whether this is a normal “academia reality” situation or a role/pay mismatch that needs clearer boundaries.

The professor didn’t get back to me till several days after, she gave me the permissions code add Super nice professor I’ve been having issues actually enrolling because when I went to go enroll, it was past the initial start date. She told me to reach out to the admissions office and she has been involving me in class through zoom link so I have been participating in the class, and there is proof also the admissions office did not answer their phones. The director was extremely rude to me, which is shocking because how can an adult in this position of authority bully a young college student trying to be an advocate for their own education? She essentially didn’t believe me which is fine I’ll show proof but they were simply not going to help me and tried to tell me no until i pushed to talk to someone higher up because the policy didn’t make sense. She said she needed proof of my call log and my communication my professor naturally I also CCed my professor because usually the policy is the professor reaches out to them, and they can enroll me. The director also asked me why I even called when the office was closed which I did not know their office was closed there was no indication online providing current office hours and only mentioned winter break in their machine recording. I also called prior to closing as well. They did not call me back before they closed and she was trying to refuse to help me, based off her assumption that I wasn’t telling the truth. I got off the phone so frazzled and upset. which seems so silly because all I’m doing is trying to get school done and continue a class that a professor is more than happy to have me in? I sent an email showing my call log and the zoom meeting and email chat from my professor. I CCed my professor not that my professor has any authority over this director which is my fear that the Director does not seem happy with me, that I will not be able to enroll in this class, which is super frustrating because I needed to continue my transfer trying to figure out who to send and talk to regarding the matter. I’m doing college on my own and I don’t have an adult to confide in… trying to be my own advocate and figure out what and who to talk to in the chain of command because if this Director feels comfortable enough acting this way with one student I’m sure it’s happened with others and I feel like most young adults starting off in the world don’t know how and what to do.

"Introducing Libertas DAO: A New Platform for Scientific Research. We are the team behind Libertas DAO, a project aimed at overcoming the challenges of the current academic journal system. The system is often seen as unfair, as scholars have to pay a lot of money to publish their work in reputable journals, and publishers obtain the marketing rights. Our goal at Libertas DAO is to provide a platform where scholars can publish their papers for free and exchange ideas. We plan to eventually become a full-fledged DAO, but for now, we are focusing on providing the MVP and defining the finite tokenomics before moving forward with the DAO structure. We believe that taking this step-by-step approach will allow us to ensure that our platform and tokenomics are sound before we transition to the full DAO model. What sets Libertas DAO apart from other platforms is its peer-review system, which works similar to the pull-request system on GitHub. Scholars receive tokens as rewards for publishing their papers and for participating in the peer-review process. These tokens are essential for generating income for the scholars. Libertas DAO's business model is based on monthly subscriptions for non-academic users, similar to Spotify. Private companies must pay higher fees to access all papers published on Libertas DAO. Another source of income is conducting big data analyses of the papers and storing the profits in a decentralized treasury. This income will be paid monthly to members of the DAO. The exact tokenomics are not yet specified, but in general, the monthly dividend for token holders correlates with the number of tokens held. The dividend is independent of the token price and thus has real value. Our ultimate goal is to provide scholars with a way to conduct research independently of institutions and to self-finance. Currently, the project is in its early stages, but the development of the MVP is progressing well, and we are optimistic about its success. We believe that our project will allow scholars to exchange ideas and advance their research in new and innovative ways. We have registered a domain for our platform: [**https://www.libertas-dao.com**](https://www.libertas-dao.com/), where you can find more information about our project and whitepaper. If you are interested in joining our Telegram group, please contact us via PM.

He then said he had a class to teach soon soon and that we had to leave, he would not talk with us anymore. It was insane. We had an entire semester of work into a site and he gave us literally &lt;5 mins and said we failed. I emailed him the next day asking him to please look again, there must have been a misunderstanding (was trying to be polite) and that we had a fully functional site. He responded the next day saying that he did not meet any business requirements, our implementation was entirely incorrect and we need to start over. &amp;#x200B; I emailed him again, reiterating the misunderstanding and listing off several business requirements we met (the things he said in the beginning of the semester) and that we just wanted him to review the entirety of our site because he only visited a single page. He agreed. We met with him yesterday and sat down for **2 hours** reviewing our site. He was hostile and he nitpicked every single little thing, none of which were requirements he mentioned. Things like: our site used military time instead of standard time. That one of the sections of the site only listed the user's email, not their phone number (email was a requirement, phone number was never mentioned) etc etc. At one point he complained we were missing something, I told him he could find it at a different part of the site and he said ""if you want to argue with me i'll just leave"". At the end he said he was going to mark our project as Incomplete, that we should both find new partners, we had a ton of work to do and that all our data was bad. &amp;#x200B; I do not believe it was possible to pass this class. I don't know if he had a grudge against me for some reason, if its because my group was entirely women, because im young and have a kid or what. I'm not claiming our site was perfect, we definitely missed some details here and there, but i'm 100% confident it should have been sufficient to pass (its a graded class but hes just marking it as incomplete). I've reached out to other groups in the class and the majority failed and many of them were taking this class for the 2nd or 3rd time.

"Frustrated by pointless student meetings. I'm in the UK, where most Universities (in theory) operate a 'pastoral' academic advisor type system. Each academic has circa 10 students from each year of the programme (so 30-40 students in total), for whom they act as personal tutors. The vagaries of the system varies between Unis, but - to my mind - it's largely a checkbox exercise. We sell the idea of a 'pastoral' system to students (and their parents); that there is a kindly, invested academic monitoring the progress and wellbeing of the student. In practice, there is no training, quality control, or actual purpose to the system, and it's luck of the draw how much work it is, depending on your gender / ethnicity / personality / the preparedness and anxiety of your student group. The UK is in a fairly dire state in terms of funding (which depends partly on student fees), so my institution, like many, is becoming concerned about student recruitment and retention. The result of this in my current institution is that so much of my time and energy is now being spent emailing students, chasing them, phoning them, and engaging in SO MANY pointless meetings with them to 'discuss progress and study strategies'. The students who are competent already know how to work on their feedback. The students who are lazy don't want to improve their academic skills. I've found maybe 2 students in between, who genuinely want to improve their academic skills and didn't know about the tutoring centre. Ordinarily, these are the exact type of directives that I ignore, as there is never any follow up, however, the pressure is now being put on the students to schedule these check-ins with their tutors - they're reminded in all their classes, and told it's compulsory. I simply don't have the time to meet each student - plus all my research project students - for a one-to-one, on top of teaching, and marking, and answering email, and attempting to squeeze in an hour of research once in a while",Fees,Low,0.0,web:pullpush:r/Professors:submission:fee,Low,0,1995,343,7,Frustrated by pointless student meetings.,0

"I was Registered for classes I never PERSONALLY registered for …. I am in need of immediate help from any academic advisor, college graduate, or anyone who may have worked at academic affairs at any college or universities. I’ll just start of by saying that I used to attend a private HBCU. It’s known for money laundering and while no one has every publicly spoke about it, it’s a huge issue and students lose thousands, yearly, dealing with this campus. In Spring of 2021, I was told to leave the campus do to a mental health situation that put me in danger. They got me the first flight out of there, from then on, I never registered for classes, spoke to any academic advising, or anyone for that matter. For Fall 2021, Spring 2022, Fall 2022 I never registered for any classes. Not to mention, in countless emails that I did not respond to, I was continuously informed that I am not financially cleared to attend any class; both by teachers and academic advising. After looking through more emails, I find my academic advisor and the chair of the Criminal Justice department asking me “do you want to re-enroll?”, “would you like to attend classes and set up a schedule?”. During this time I was not logged into my student portal so I did not respond, meaning NO. As I look deeper into the emails, I see one that says, “I was advised to enroll you in classes”. That does not seem right at all. Is that okay to do? They enrolled me in classes for 3 semesters without my approval, dropping my GPA. I am currently seeking a retroactive withdrawal and I’m hoping it goes through but I don’t know if they will because they get away with stuff like this. I am so devastated because when I looked back at my GPA, it is below a 1.0, meaning academic probation (which they were not going to tell me, the school is very negligent).

"Why should I study. Kinda just a rant For context, I'm clearly far from bright. I'm currently a 12th grader in Asia. This question isn't commonly asked here. Anyway, because I'm not that smart, I study a good amount. Parents and teachers always are like ""study twice as hard if you need to"" well, twice apparently isn't enough for me to make up for it. However, I am an honor's student, how? Well, I worked hard enough to get decent math grades and I have a slightly unfair advantage called being half American in Asia, so I have good English grades. Which is somehow all you need to be an honors student in a small town. But I do feel like it isn't as much as people make it out to be since I've never had any proper training in English. Now, my college entrance exam is coming up, we got one of those big exams to determine where you gonna go. Everyone else's working hard and getting good, well most at least, and I'm not seeing any improvement whatsoever. Honestly, that slightly unfair advantage is the only thing keeping me afloat. (Which sucks btw, having you're best grade being from something you barely worked for while working so hard for everything else and getting nothing.) So I'm gonna be going to some crap school where professors barely teach and everyone will either make fun of me or feel sorry for me. It's gonna suck. This is what I get for studying. So why should I study. What's the point in studying twice as hard just to learn half of everyone does. Why isn't there an other path? What sucks even more is that when I heard college is apparently ""easier"" in the US, I asked my parents and they were like ""too expensive, you can do that for your masters"" because apparently that is the default around here. I even got teachers acting like all my school's honors student will get a PhD.

"Normal for PI to be too busy to keep up with their own research. Hi guys, not sure if this is the correct place to post this. Throwaway account just in case. I'm an undergrad intern (unpaid) currently assisting with research where I'm supposed to play a fairly minor role. I've been with this project for a little over a year and a half. Initially, my main responsibilities were to just help around the lab, do data entry, keep track of files, etc., but as time has progressed I've gained more and more responsibilities related to the project. I didn't mind this initially, I liked getting more experience in new areas, but sometimes I feel like I'm expected to do more than I'm supposed to? I've ended up becoming the main person in charge of managing, maintaining, and making decisions about our data to the point where I'm constantly having to explain and update the PI on the status of the project. He's always too busy with something else, and it often feels like he's too detached from the current work to keep up. It's been really frustrating explaining the same concepts and decisions over and over to him. I've read stories on here about PIs who are unavailable or uninvolved, but only in the case of grad students working on their own research. This isn't my research project and I'm not responsible for getting the work published, so I'm not sure whether these are normal expectations. We have a deadline coming up, on top of additional work starting, and I've been feeling a lot of pressure from the PI to get the work done faster. When I'm unable to work, progress tends to stall or halt. On top of that, we're bringing on two more interns who I'm expected to help at least partially train and manage tasks for. I can only dedicate so much time to this internship since I also have classes and a part-time job, and the PI is aware of this. He does plan to start giving me a small stipend, but nothing has been set in stone yet, and it's coming with the expectation that I'll take on more responsibilities. Funding has been tight, and the way the interns were hired means that they are getting paid a higher stipend (but for more hours) than I am for a similar job, which has felt somewhat unfair. I really like the research we're doing and want to stick around. We're starting to head in a direction I'm a lot more interested in, and I feel the experience I can get from it would be valuable to my future career/educational goals. I have been applying to other avenues/internships in areas I'm interested in but with no luck, which is part of why I don't want to leave. I don't mean to paint the PI in a bad light here, I think he's genuinely trying his best to manage everything and he makes an effort to be around and involved when he can.

"Marked down for choosing a ‘bad topic’ from a list of topics. Hi all. I'm an online Australian university student, and recently had a class by a highly tenured professor on research in ICT. Ive had two classes from this professor and they have been some of the most poorly organised unfair classes I've ever had. All assignment sheets were on one page with a quarter page on average for instructions, reused lecture slides from another university with no recordings, and the tutor spoke such poor English that I had to teach myself the courses. Recently I did two assignments where I had to choose an ACM level 3 topic (dl.acm.org), and do a 20 minute presentation along with a 1500 word report, giving a superficial overview of the research topic. This made up 70% of my course grade for the class. I chose ""Philosophical/Theoretical Foundations of artificial intelligence"" as my topic (a valid level 3 ACM topic), and lost 40% marks on both assignments for the topic being ""too broad"". He also incorrectly marked me down for not attending the presentations, when I was there for the whole thing via zoom. My grades are excellent in every class and I spend 40-60 hours a week studying to keep my high GPA, but every class with this professor has been an absolute nightmare.

"Institutional formula for need based aid. Good morning! Hoping I can find some information about the institutional formula used to calculate need-based financial aid. Met with the financial aid office at an institution my child wants to attend, and while my expected contribution as the non-custodial parent was well within reason, the other parent’s expected contribution was nearly 30% MORE than the actual total cost of attendance according to the calculations. They explained, of course, that wasn’t what the parent would actually pay, but what the formula indicated they could pay. My question, then, is this: how do they determine the calculation? Does it not take in account actual costs of living? Or do I just live well below my income and the other parent lives well above? The other parent indicates they can only afford about 40% of actual cost of attendance.

"Grad School Panic/Crisis Before Starting. I am starting a neurobiology graduate program in a few weeks and I'm feeling incredibly, incredibly upset. I don't think I have felt this way in a long time and I am not certain if I need to listen to my feelings, or if there is something very irrational and unhealthy going on that I need to power through. Reading through the subreddit, I feel like many of you have had experience with such moments. I am coming directly from my bachelor's degree. During that time, I did research with a professor at a neighboring university (so on my transcript, I did not ever attend the university at which I was researching). I truly enjoyed my work and I'm an author on two pending publications, both to not insignificant journals. My PI was something of a workaholic but we had a great working relationship, and we have certainly become friends in our own right as well over the years. I began searching for a PhD program last year and I was given many great options. The institution where I'd been researching put up a ridiculously nice offer for me to stay- an extra $15,000 and the realistic chance of finishing in three years- and although they are not even close to a top 10 program, I felt excellent about the research I was doing, the collaboration possibilities, departmental support and my PI's standing in his subfield. Perhaps most importantly, though, I felt very involved and passionate about my research topic and it never felt like a chore to work weekends or nights. I was very stressed about making a decision. I got into the #1 program as well as many other ""big names"". I felt a lot of pressure to make a decision, and I just didn't know what to do. I was also really depressed at the time, and I am still having some issues with that. I ended up selecting a top 10 program that certainly looks worthwhile, but I am finding myself very angry/upset this summer and feeling conviction-less. I have a number of concerns, and I worry that I made a decision based on the dogma of doing something new for newness' sake and the security of big names rather than on what I wanted to do as ""me"". But I might have also made the right choice. I'm just not sure. All I know is that I feel very upset and I'm having trouble bringing myself to even look at housing or moving. I can still change programs, as I have very close connections at the other university. But I'm afraid of cutting myself out of what might be a necessary change/growth that I am irrationally resisting. Top 10 School: I would start over entirely new, have to do rotations, I'm not sure who I would end up working for or how I would feel about my research topic but I would be exposed to many new ideas and topics. It would take 5-6 years, the culture of the university tends towards larger labs (at least 15 people) and relatively infrequent contact with PIs (once a week). I would be extremely far from my family with prohibitively expensive airfare. University I Know: I could go right back to working on projects I really like and am personally invested in finishing, I would take courses but would not need to rotate, I could finish in 3 years with solid publications, I work great with my PI although he is on the overbearing side. Our research techniques are not mainstream and it is not likely I will be able to continue it elsewhere. I would be a few hours away from my family by plane.

"9-Month Contract. I recently started a new job as a NTT teaching professor. I spent many years working in industry. I took this job in no small part because I expected better work-life balance, and I actually believed I would get the summer off to spend with my kids. The semester is wrapping up, and I'm realizing now that there. seems to be an unspoken expectation that I will spend a lot of time this summer doing prep and meeting with various colleagues and administrators? The colleague that I work with most closely sent me an email saying that he plans to basically work all summer except for some time off in June. Don't get me wrong, the students and other faculty benefit from his work and dedication. At the same time, if the teaching load is so high (it is) that we don't have time to do this prep during the school year (when we are actually paid), then that's the department's problem to fix. I don't think we should just work harder to cover up a systemic problem. I want to be assertive, but not mean or confrontational. It's obviously my colleagues's choice how he wants to spend his time. I'm thinking of responding with a friendly ""I'm on a 9-month contract, and already have other plans for the summer. I'll be back in August."" I need to set some personal boundaries for the sake of my sanity and personal life. Honestly, my boundary is that I need to work during business hours only, and only during the 9 months when I'm contacted. I will do the very best I can during that time, but if the work starts routinely expanding beyond that, it just isn't sustainable for me long-term. I don't mind gently asserting this boundary, but I would like to understand whether this is something that is just not going to work out in academia from a cultural perspective? I did a PhD years ago, and there were no boundaries at all around research (I used to work at night and on the weekend, as did practically everyone else), so I understand that can be a thing. The reality of my life is much different now, though. I'm a single parent, and I will put my kids ahead of my career 100% of the time.

"What do you think is the best option here for me. Hello everyone! This is my first time posting here, so please let me know if there’s a specific format I should be following or anything else I should know. I’m seeking some guidance and advice regarding a few options that have been proposed to me. I come from a Math/Stats background with a physics minor, and I’m currently pursuing a Course-Based Master’s in Science with a focus on Data Science. I say ""focus on Data Science"" because, frankly, I don’t think the program is doing a great job of preparing students for the industry, despite how much it promotes that aspect. Over the past year, I’ve developed a keen interest in research, especially around data science and machine learning. I’ve reached out to several professors I’d like to work with, and I’m fortunate to have received positive responses. Now, I’m facing two very different options, and I’d love to get your input. Here’s the context: As of now, I’m in the math department, and I’ve completed 6 courses that could potentially transfer if I decide to go in one of the directions. If I choose one of the professors, I may need to transfer some courses or take extra ones. The two professors I’m considering are working in completely different fields: 1. **Jane** – Focuses on Space Physics applications using Machine Learning (ML) to analyze solar wind and inverse problems. 2. **John** – Works in mathematical biology, specifically cell biology, using diffusion models and mathematical models combined with ML. # Option A: I could pursue the MSc in Stats/Math. In this case, Jane and John would try to find a research intersection, likely around mathematical modeling and machine learning. There’s no guarantee they'll land on something, but both Jane and John believe there’s plenty of potential for a good collaboration, especially with my background in Math/Stats. This option also keeps open the possibility of working solely with Jane on biostatistics if they can’t find a solid research fit. # Option B: The second option is a bit more last-minute: applying to the MSc in Physics. Jane not super familiar with the process, but I’d apply as an external candidate, and the timeline would be pretty tight to get everything in by mid or late next week. This option would allow me to dive deeper into space physics and physics-focused ML, but I’d still end up with a fair number of Math/Stats and RL courses. The major difference between Option A and B is the balance of courses—how much ""space + stats"" vs. ""stats + space"" I want to focus on. Physics, of course, will require more physics coursework, but since Jane’s research is AI-focused, I’d still get plenty of Math/Stats and ML experience regardless. In the end I'd like to move into a PhD either in math or physics depending on what I choose for my MSc, but after that I'll probably move into the industry with focus on applying AI/ML methods but my friend brought up that a Physics PhD is not appealing compared to a Math PhD and this has been worriesome for me.

"Room Beside Me is Rude. I recently moved rooms, about 4-5 weeks ago because of my mental health and amount of loud music, yelling, talking and overall obnoxious behavior in my hall. Id often be woken up around 2am multiple nights a week and everyday for hours the room beside me would blast music so loud I could feel the bass. Despite my complaints to the RAs nothing was done so I moved rooms and dorms because that's just how it worked out with the Residential Life department. I moved into this dorm because it was smaller and quieter which stayed true for the first 3 weeks. Everyone seemed nice the only problem was the girl to the right of my room would play music loud sometimes, I didn't mind because it wasn't nearly as loud or obnoxious as my other dorm and she would only do it for maybe an hour at a time like twice a week. I could just turn my TV up louder. However I found out two girls moved into the room to my left which wasn't a problem at all. I only noticed once I saw one of them in the hall getting water, and she saw me go into my room. I have no idea when she moved in but I can only assume it was recently as she has no name tag on her door like me.The people who moved in at the begining of the year get a name tag on their door. What makes me think she moved in around a week ago is because the issues I'm about to describe did not take place till after I saw her in the hallway. About 4 or so days I was watching TV and I hear a knock. Nobody ever knocks on my and it was around 1am. I got really scared because I get paranoid at night about getting attacked or something bad happening to me. (It's just an irrational fear but I leave my room as little as possible after 9pm). At first I didn't realize it was a knock because I was to engrossed in watching TV and assume it was just the occasional thump from outside or from another room somewhere. Then it happens another time and I take a minute to realize it's a knock and get scared. So I walk up to the door and wait for another then I slowly open the door. (I wouldn't be so scared if my room had a peephole like my old but it doesn't). I answered it and she asks me nicely to turn the TV down because it's to loud and I say 'ok, sorry.' and turn it down. Which was fine because it was a bit loud. Then two nights later I get woken up at 4:30am by intense pounding on my door. Like it was so hard I thought someone was trying to get inside. Obviously this scared the shit out of me and I wait to see if they'd leave, I wasn't thinking it was this girl again. After 10 minutes she still keeps banging on my door. So I walk over and open it slowly only to see this girl. She tells me she's hasn't been able to sleep for over an hour because my TV is to loud. I say sorry and close the door and turn the TV down. The thing is my TV was at 10, you can't even hear it through my door which is thinner then the wall. And my TV is at the opposite wall from hers so I have no idea how she can it hear it across my room and through her wall and it is so loud she can't sleep. She could be a light sleeper or be used to no noise but there's an amount of sound to be expected in a dorm. It's unreasonable to expect it to be silent that's just what it is. I sleep with the TV on every night and I have since I moved in, keeping it at around 10-8 and during the day 10-15 sometimes 20 if the show is really quiet. And I have never once gotten any complaints until she saw me go into that room. During the day she never says anything. But ever since she moved in I've heard loud banging against the wall she shares with me it happens 10-20 time a day. So loud I can hear it over the TV which isn't saying much. The banging is so loud sometimes I think it's sounds like someone's trying to come through the wall. Id started noticing it a little before she moved in but ever since she came to my door that one night I hear it all the time. She stops at night which is nice but it's even louder now. I'm not sure if it's passive aggression or what. I have no idea if she does this to the other wall she shares. It's very confusing because whenever she comes to my door she acts nice. I'm going to tell an RA but I was wondering if other people thought I was over reacting. Or if I was the rude one. TL:DR I moved into a new room and someone moved in beside me recently. They complain my TVs loud when I think it's not and are constantly banging on the wall we share.

"I think two weeks is not much time to write a 6-page paper, especially when it's due at midterms, when all the other classes are having things due as well. My main complaint about professors/teachers is that they always seem to think their class is the only one students are taking. That said, I think it's important for you to be fair and transparent. Just because a student manages to use words that resonate with you, doesn't mean you should grant their extension and not someone else's who used different words. You could grant everyone's extension, you could grant no one's, you could extend the deadline for everyone in the class, you could require support from an outside source (like doctor or counselor) before granting an extension. Long extensions could indeed be unfair to those who worked to submit by the deadline; you should probably have told everyone in advance that an extension would be possible under certain circumstances, so they could make a decision for themselves. I advise you talk to your mentor/department head about what options are allowed and common. One of my favorite professors told us, if you need an extension, just ask and I will grant it, you don't have to explain why. It was for a specific amount of time for everyone, like a week.

"My 8-step CS research framework is being plagiarised in journals &amp; theses — how should I respond. Hi all, I’m looking for advice from academics who’ve dealt with plagiarism of their work, especially when it’s *methodological* or framework-style writing. # Background: I developed an 8-step framework for CS research Back in **2012**, while I was an undergraduate at **St. Xavier’s College, Kolkata**, I started working on a simple, practical framework to help students learn *how* to start doing research in Computer Science. In **2014**, as a postgraduate student at the **University of Manchester**, I formalised this into a paper titled: “How to Start a Research Work in Computer Science: A Framework for Beginners” The paper introduced what I called the **“Eight-Step Approach to Research”**, aimed at students who are completely new to research. It was originally hosted on the University of Manchester’s eScholar platform (the [original hosted link](https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw:231841&amp;datastreamId=FULL-TEXT.PDF) is now broken), but the PDF still exists in various mirrors and re-uploads (e.g. [Academia.edu](https://www.academia.edu/34540632/How_to_Start_a_Research_Work_in_Computer_Science_A_Framework_For_Beginners), [Scribd](https://www.scribd.com/document/420027245/How-to-Start-a-Research-Work-in-Computer-Science-pdf), etc.), and I have the original copy. Over the past decade, this framework has been used fairly widely: * It has been **properly cited** by some academics and courses. For example, in **CS 559 (Quantitative Cyber-Security)** at **Colorado State University**, the lecture slides explicitly reference:*“How to Start a Research Work in Computer Science: A Framework For Beginners – Somdip Dey”*[cs.colostate.edu](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/~cs559/Fall24/slides/L4.pdf) (I would also like to point out that I published a [shorter paper in ACM XRDS](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2627954) about my original work as well) * Other universities and CS methodology courses list my paper among recommended resources for research methods in Computer Science. [Google Sites](https://sites.google.com/site/guigalante/home/metodologia-de-pesquisa-em-computa%C3%A7%C3%A3o-mestrado?utm_source=chatgpt.com) That’s all fine and expected — I wrote it *precisely* to help students and early-career researchers. # The problem: blatant plagiarism, including in a journal article What’s bothering me now is that I’m increasingly finding **blatant, word-for-word reuse of my framework** in other people’s work **without any citation or acknowledgement** — and in some cases with other authors claiming the framework as their *own*. A particularly serious example is this paper: &gt;**“Starting Research in Computer Science: A Structured Guide for Beginners”** Published in the *International Journal of Computer Networks and Wireless Communications (IJCNWC)* PDF: [https://www.ijcnwc.com/admin/uploads/Starting%20Research%20in%20Computer%20Science%20A%20Structured%20Guide%20for%20Beginners.pdf](https://www.ijcnwc.com/admin/uploads/Starting%20Research%20in%20Computer%20Science%20A%20Structured%20Guide%20for%20Beginners.pdf) When I compared this article against my original 2014 paper, I found that: * The structure is the same: it presents an **8-step approach to research in Computer Science**. * The **step names and explanations are, in many places, word-for-word identical** to my framework. * Example issues (non-exhaustive): * Phrasing, ordering of steps, and examples closely mirror my original text. * Distinctive explanatory sentences and even some “informal” phrasings I used as a student appear unchanged. * Yet the article: * Lists **different authors**. * **Does not cite my original paper** at all. * Presents the 8-step framework as if it were the authors’ own structured guide. Separately, I’ve also found **multiple theses and guidance documents** (often on sites like Academia.edu) that: * Reproduce large chunks of my “Eight-Step Approach to Research” (including unusual phrases and examples) almost verbatim; * Replace “Computer Science” with some other field (e.g. “Guidance &amp; Counselling” or specific education topics); * And again, **omit any reference** to my original work. So this is no longer just “inspired by” or “similar idea” territory — in many cases it’s **direct textual copying** with my name removed. # Why I care (beyond ego) To be clear, I’m not trying to gatekeep the idea that “research can be taught in steps” — that’s obviously not unique. What *is* specific is: * The **exact wording**, structure and examples of my 8-step framework. * The fact that I developed this as a student between **2012–2014**, and it has since been: * Hosted by the University of Manchester, * Re-used legitimately with citation by universities (e.g. Colorado State University), and * Recognised enough that I’ve recently written an updated 2025 version of the framework for Computer Science &amp; AI research. Meanwhile, other people are now: * Publishing what appears to be **copied text** as their own pedagogical work, including in a **peer-reviewed journal**. * Using it in theses and methodology sections without any acknowledgement that this framework and wording came from somewhere. This feels wrong both academically and ethically, and it also potentially distorts the historical record of who actually created the framework. # What I’ve done so far So far, I’ve: * Collected: * My original 2014 paper (with timestamped hosting history), * The plagiarised IJCNWC article, and * Several other examples (theses / guidance docs) with overlapping text. * Confirmed that some reputable courses and academics *do* cite my work correctly, which helps establish that: * The framework is recognised as mine, * It has a history of legitimate use. * I have re uploaded my original copy on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/397670903_How_to_Start_a_Research_Work_in_Computer_Science_A_Framework_For_Beginners) for ease of access for others. What I *haven’t* done yet: * Contacted IJCNWC or the authors of the plagiarising paper. * Contacted universities whose students appear to have used my framework verbatim without citation. * Filed any formal complaints with editors or institutions. (These steps seem to be very tedious given so many blatant copies of my original work) # What I’m asking Reddit / academics for I’d really appreciate advice on: 1. **How should I approach the journal (IJCNWC) and the authors?** * Is it better to contact the authors first, or go straight to the editor with a documented comparison? * Should I explicitly request a retraction / correction, or start with a softer “this appears to be unacknowledged reuse of my work”? 2. **How far should I go with older theses and departmental documents?** * Is it worth contacting institutions about student theses and internal teaching docs that copy my text? * Or is it more realistic to focus on **published, citable articles** (like the IJCNWC paper)? 3. **How to frame this professionally (not emotionally) but still firmly.** * Any examples of emails / letters that others have used successfully in similar situations? * Anything I should absolutely *avoid* saying from a legal or reputational perspective? 4. **Long-term: is it worth writing a short “note” or commentary article** * Either in a journal or on a personal/professional site, clearly documenting the origin and evolution of this Eight-Step framework, and its use in teaching? * Would that help reinforce proper attribution going forward? I’m not looking to “sue everyone”; I mainly want: * The most egregious cases corrected (e.g. journal article presenting my text as someone else’s framework); * Clearer recognition that this Eight-Step framework originated from my work; * And some guidance on what’s considered reasonable and proportionate in academia when your work is reused without credit.

"Hated this course. Prof was unclear in lectures, wrote messy notes on the board and his online notes were even worse.

"What's your 'life hack' as a professor that sounds ridiculous but actually changed everything. As someone with ADHD who struggles with the endless grading and feedback cycle, I accidentally discovered something that completely changed how I work and grade. I started using voice dictation software for almost everything, and I know it sounds absurd at first. The problem started when I had a ton of ungraded papers and unwritten emails to respond to. It turns out that the simple switch of speaking my feedback instead of typing helps me get through it all several times faster. I now use voice dictation for detailed student feedback, emails for admin, rubric comments, etc without typing a single word. I can use it anywhere on my computer The difference is night and day. My feedback is actually more detailed and personalized because I'm not subconsciously limiting myself to save typing effort, and it’s taking me half the time. Several colleagues thought it was nuts in the beginning but several of now them are now converts after seeing how good it is. They had a ton of questions about which tool to use so I made a small guide for you guys as well. **Apple and Windows Built-in Dictation** \- Decent for quick emails but frustrating for detailed assignment feedback. It struggles with academic terminology, longer explanations, and often cuts off mid-sentence when I'm in the flow of explaining a concept. Fine for basic communication, but not reliable enough for meaningful student feedback or curriculum planning. **Dragon Dictation** \- This used to be the gold standard for educators, but after being acquired, it's gone downhill. It's no longer supported on Mac, and the accuracy has taken a hit. For the price, it's no longer worth it, especially with our limited department budgets. It's a shame because Dragon was once excellent for academic vocabulary. **WillowVoice** \- This is what I currently use and recommend to colleagues. It handles academic terminology surprisingly well (even specialized subject vocabulary), formats text properly for every platform, and rarely makes mistakes that change the meaning of my feedback. The educational discount makes it reasonable, and the time saved is well worth it. I can provide substantive feedback on rough drafts that actually helps students improve. **Aiko** \- The accuracy is okay, but since it processes everything locally, it can slow down when I'm also running our department's grading software or video lectures. The latency is noticeable, and it doesn't automatically format text which makes it not as good as WillowVoice for me. The biggest win is that my students get more thoughtful feedback now, and it takes less time than it did before.

"Do different things on different days or a little of everything everyday. I was hoping fellow grad students could answer this question because, while obviously everyone on the planet has multiple competing priorities to deal with each day, I feel as though grad school is unique in that pretty much of all of these competing priorities are ongoing things to some degree. For instance, I take a math course, which has homework assignments each week and generally can't be done in a single work session. I also have a research project that I'm working on from which I get my actual funding and requires me to write/read/write code, and I'm also working toward doing my research exam, for which I need to generally read a lot of articles. All of these things are ongoing projects in the sense that pretty much any task I do is a multi-day event. There never really seems to be any small task that I can sit down and just do in an hour or two and say ""okay, that's completely finished."" My question to you all is, do you try to work on a little bit of everything each day, or do you try to devote some days to readings, some to experiments, and some days to class work, etc? Right now, I feel like I try to work on a little of everything each day, but I get way less done than I would like because I find the act of switching gears between things to be mentally really draining.

Advice on bad professors. I have been having an issue with my public speaking professor at my community college. Dropping is also not an option for me either. So from the first day she has been bullying me and I don’t know why. I also want to mention I love public speaking and do it often. First the issue is I have a life threatening airborne peanut allergy I mentioned it one time because the kid next to me was about to open something with peanuts and for my safety I mentioned it. She yelled at me. Then I had an anxiety attack and she yelled at me and scared me so much I would get yelled at even just going to the bathroom so I hold it until I get home. Then it seemed like no matter what everything I seem to do is wrong to her. Finally I lost it mentally today. I asked her can she please cut me some slack today I had a sore throat from vomiting for 4 days. I’m so stressed out I’m physically sick. She told me no so I tried to stick it out but she kept giving me attitude to the point it triggered a panic attack not an anxiety attack and I was so worked up I was trying not to vomit. She then kicked me out of class for staying because she told me she was giving me a zero for today if I leave. It was so bad I considered going to the ER I had the worst panic attack of my life. I was legit shaking. The rest of today I have been off and on crying and convinced she decided day one not even knowing me she hated me. She’s also called me stupid twice and I got it on recording her being so rude while I am having a panic attack and trying not to vomit. I just don’t know what to do.

"First world request: looking for recommendations for a laptop and/or a bag for school. I’m starting a grad program in school psych next month, and my beloved Asus Zenbook 13 is 6 years old and finally starting to act like it’s on its last legs…. just in time for classes to start back up again. I’d love recommendations for laptops that you love! **Needs:** - I’m leaning toward Windows, as that is what I’ve always had and I will need to run SPSS for a few classes (can a Mac run SPSS?) - I prefer a smaller footprint (13in is ideal, with 14 being fine too) - I love how thin but sturdy my Zenbook is. It fits pretty much anywhere, but the body is mostly aluminum or whatever they make these things from 😅 Im not worried about plastic somehow cracking or whatever, plus it just feels nicer to work with - Budget 😅 I’d prefer under 1k. I don’t game or draw or anything major on my laptop, it’s almost exclusively for school work and shopping. Second, less question: Looking for a shoulder/tote style bag for campus. I have one that has done well, but the straps kill me and I expect to be carrying more than I was in undergrad as I’ll be on campus for longer stretches. **Needs:** - MUST be a shoulder bag. I have an injury on my non-dominant shoulder that I’m probably going to end up having surgery for in the next few months, so backpacks are off the table. - I’d prefer actual leather, but I’m definitely down for other materials if you’ve had a great experience with them. Mine is “vegan leather” and it is showing wear in a not cute way. - A structured bag that can stand up on its own would be ideal. Extra points for organizing pockets inside, especially if there is a slot for a water bottle. - Finally, I would love it if it looked somewhat polished without having a bunch of overt branding. I’m hoping this can be a workhorse that will go with me through school as well as practicums and internship in schools, so the goal is a quality bag that doesn’t draw attention (so not a Neverfull or something identifiable). I’m not trying to spend a crazy amount of money but I’m also fine with saving for a bit if the perfect bag is over a couple hundred bucks.

"Roommates making a mess in common spaces and not cleaning up. So I live in an apartment style dorm with a kitchen and a common area. It’s me and four others.

They live in the same room and are dating, they’re room is a mess but since it doesn’t affect me I don’t care. The issue is that they bring their mess into our common areas. I cleaned and organized our table like 2 days ago and now it’s a mess again. It’s covered in their stuff, one of them used our kitchen trash bin to prop up her work. This in itself isn’t terrible but I got back from the library an hour ago and it was the exact same condition as when I left. I know they are back in the dorms because one of them left her bag on the floor in the middle of the walkway. They’ve left clothes in the common area (one time they left a sock on the table). They leave their dirty dishes on the counter and I’m the only one who loads and unloads the dishwasher. I’m so tired of having to clean up after them. We need to get maintenance to our dorm because our kitchen outlets aren’t powering anything but we can’t until the space is clean because maintenance will call the RA about the conditions. I’ve told them that they should leave their space the way they’ve found it.

"How do I bring up concerns to my advisor. I apologize for the long post, but I need some advice about how to approach my advisor about my frustrations and worries. Here is all the necessary background information: 1. I want to graduate this semester. 2. I would like to be further along on my thesis than I currently am, but I was not able to work as much on it during the summer because my advisor wanted me to analyze samples THAT I AM NOT EVEN USING FOR MY THESIS. He kept saying I would get help running these samples (seek out undergrads willing to volunteer, hire an undergrad for the lab, he himself would come in and help, etc.), BUT I NEVER GOT HELP. While I was analyzing these samples, he kept telling me I should be working more on my thesis. I kept reminding him that he wanted these samples analyzed which would just prompt him telling me I would get help soon, so then I'd be able to really focus on my thesis. AGAIN THE HELP NEVER CAME. 3. My advisor is overall a good advisor. He has generally been available when I need help, but it seems that when it really counts, he falls short. When I was writing my thesis proposal, he kept dragging his feet on giving me edits. He procrastinated so much that I had to send out my proposal a week later than I said I would to the rest of my committee. Another time, I was applying for additional funding through my university, and I wanted to apply as soon as the application portal opened because it was a first come first served kind of thing. Basically, as long as a proposal was decent, it would get funding, but once the money runs out, it runs out. I sent him my proposal to get his suggestions, and he told me he would look at it a few days before the application portal opened. He did not. I contacted him the day before it opened to see what was up. He said he would get to it the next day. He didn't. Then he said he would get to it the next day. He didn't. This went on and on, and I ended up submitting my proposal 5 days after the initial portal opened. Luckily, I still ended up getting funding, but I was so frustrated because he knew it was important to get applications in early. I've also asked him to look over my application materials for two of the jobs I've applied for because I obviously would want his suggestions to make my resume and cover letters as strong as they can be. The first one, he was timely, but the second time, he dragged his feet. I told him the day I wanted to apply by, but he didn't look at it until a couple days later. I messaged him before I applied to give him another chance, but he never responded. He then was shocked to find out I applied when he hadn't looked at it yet because the posting wasn't closed yet. This really irked me because he didn't do what he said he would, and was not communicative when he couldn't hold up his promise. 4. My advisor keeps trying to add additional things to incorporate into my thesis. I know he's just excited because the stuff I'm finding is very interesting, but now is not the time. We are already in a time crunch. Literally all of my other committee members have agreed that my project is more than enough for a masters thesis. I do not need to add more. So now my big concern is that he is going to drag his feet once again when it comes to giving me thesis edits. I am not completely done with my draft, but I have my intro, methods, and most of my results done. I told him two weeks ago that I had my intro and methods done, so he can look at it whenever he has time. He hasn't looked at it of course. I am getting worried because I don't have a lot of buffer room timewise. He is aware of this and assured me he'd be on top of things because I'm his only grad student right now. It doesn't seem like he's on top of it. How can I confront him about these concerns without coming off as rude or entitled? I know he has other responsibilities, and I'm not entitled to all of his time. It's just if I am to submit all the stuff I need to submit on time, he needs to do what he needs to do in a timely manner. From past instances, I am feeling like I can't really count on him. I am kind of kicking myself because I should have just told him I wasn't going to run those samples unless extra help was lined up. I kept believing him when he said I was going to get help soon. I also need advice on how to tell him no about adding additional things to my thesis. He has a way of making me feel like I'm not doing enough even though I am doing more than I should be.

"How to approach reading papers with a mind that is too practical. I know there have been a million threads and a ton of discussion on *how* to read a paper. But at this stage I don't have any issues with comprehension. My problem is that I don't absorb information from papers, even if I understand it perfectly well. To be more precise, it seems like I'm only capable of absorbing information that is directly related to something I've done or that I am learning to do. All other information just kind of goes out as soon as it goes in. For example, I can understand what technique they used, and what the results were, but maybe not why they used that particular technique over another, or the significance of the results when compared with the rest of the field. And once I'm done reading the paper, I couldn't tell you what the results were if you asked me a couple days later. This is becoming more of a problem as I move through my grad school career. My project is very different compared to my labmates, so there's not much overlap in the literature or our methods. I don't think I've ever had a real question or a suggestion during group meetings, because it's all regarding things I don't understand well enough to think creatively about. I try to read up on literature to better understand their fields, but I run into the aforementioned problem that the information just doesn't catch.

"No, the solution to the cake problem is always algebra. I t doesn't matter if you write down the equation formally or solve it in your head, you're doing algebra. Algebra can be extremely simple and still count as algebra. Gatekeeping algebra serves no one's best interest. Every algebraic solution boils down to a sequence of arithmetic operations. It is knowing which composition of those operations gets you the correct answer which constitutes algebra. That multiple solutions exist is a feature of algebra as opposed to arithmetic. You can subtract the 20 then divide 80 by 10, or divide both sides by 10 and subtract 2 from 10. Both are algebra, regardless of if you write down an equation or not. I think your position is the far more damaging to students' confidence. Your position is that algebra is complex, that most things students are calculating is ""just arithmetic,"" that most students will never need to do algebra. It sets up algebra as a scary obstacle that people expect to be bad at because you've positioned it as difficult, transcending the stuff they are good at. My position is that students are already doing algebra. Their intuitive number sense is correct for lots of problems, and it just so happens to also be an example of algebra - meaning they already know how to do the algebraic process when they come into our class. They CAN do algebra - they already are! We just teach them how to take those ideas and use them more broadly. I find it kind of absurd that you think the solution to student self-doubt is to tell them how algebra is scary and complicated and they won't ever really need it, and that what they're good at ""doesn't really count"" as algebra.

"Article from the NY Times: “No, You Don’t Get an A for Effort”. I found this article written by Adam Grant interesting, and thought to share. Here is a link, but since it migth be paywalled, I pasted the article underneath as well: [https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/26/opinion/school-grades-a-quantity-quality.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/26/opinion/school-grades-a-quantity-quality.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare) \*\*\* After 20 years of teaching, I thought I’d heard every argument in the book from students who wanted a better grade. But recently, at the end of a weeklong course with a light workload, multiple students had a new complaint: “My grade doesn’t reflect the effort I put into this course.” High marks are for excellence, not grit. In the past, students understood that hard work was not sufficient; an A required great work. Yet today, many students expect to be rewarded for the quantity of their effort rather than the quality of their knowledge. In [surveys](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-328X/7/4/81#B21-behavsci-07-00081), two-thirds of college students say that “trying hard” should be a factor in their grades, and a third think they should get at least a B just for showing up at (most) classes. This isn’t Gen Z’s fault. It’s the result of a misunderstanding about one of the most popular educational theories. More than a generation ago, the psychologist Carol Dweck published [groundbreaking](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1998-04530-003) [experiments](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1999-05027-021)that changed how many parents and teachers talk to kids. Praising kids for their abilities undermined their resilience, making them more likely to get discouraged or give up when they encountered setbacks. They developed what came to be known as a fixed mind-set: They thought that success depended on innate talent and that they didn’t have the right stuff. To persist and learn in the face of challenges, kids needed to believe that skills are malleable. And the best way to nurture this growth mind-set was to shift from praising intelligence to praising effort. The idea of lauding persistence quickly made its way into [viral articles](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2002/07/22/the-talent-myth), [best-selling books](https://www.amazon.com/Mindset-Psychology-Carol-S-Dweck/dp/0345472322) and popular [TED talks](https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve?subtitle=en). It resonated with the Protestant work ethic and reinforced the American dream that with hard work, anyone could achieve success. Psychologists have long [found](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1992-26247-001) that rewarding effort cultivates a strong work ethic and reinforces learning. That’s especially important in a world that often [favors](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0146167215611638) [naturals](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-023-04763-2) over [strivers](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103117305413) — and for [students](https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2023-90931-003.html) who weren’t born into comfort or don’t have a record of achievement. (And it’s far preferable to the other corrective: participation trophy culture, which celebrates kids for just showing up.) The problem is that we’ve taken the practice of celebrating industriousness too far. We’ve gone from commending effort to [treating it as an end in itself](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-85298-001). We’ve taught a generation of kids that their worth is defined primarily by their work ethic. We’ve failed to remind them that working hard doesn’t guarantee doing a good job (let alone being a good person). And that does students a disservice. In one [study](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886924000709__;!IBzWLUs!WiVfy1JxYSnWATOUSCU_WlB6jM7Wzj6ZnL3zlzvxMy0R1a8gjwrVugp4E4-x8feTW7g0JDQRxn4CnnwqzzqoADp55pD_b7g$), people filled out a questionnaire to assess their grit. Then they were presented with puzzles that — secretly — had been designed to be impossible. If there wasn’t a time limit, the higher people scored on grit, the more likely they were to keep banging away at a task they were never going to accomplish. This is what worries me most about valuing perseverance above all else: It can [motivate](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009265661530012X) people to [stick](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/isj.12287) with bad strategies instead of developing better ones. With students, a textbook example is pulling all-nighters rather than spacing out their studying over a few days. If they don’t get an A, they often protest. Of course, grade grubbing isn’t necessarily a sign of entitlement. If many students are working hard without succeeding, it could be a sign that the teacher is doing something wrong — poor instruction, an unreasonable workload, excessively difficult standards or unfair grading policies. At the same time, it’s our responsibility to tell students who burn the midnight oil that although their B– might not have fully reflected their dedication, it speaks volumes about their sleep deprivation. Teachers and parents owe kids a more balanced message. There’s a reason we award Olympic medals to the athletes who swim the fastest, not the ones who train the hardest. What counts is not sheer effort but the progress and performance that result. Motivation is only one of multiple variables in the achievement equation. Ability, opportunity and luck count, too. Yes, you can get better at anything, but you can’t be great at everything. The ideal response to a disappointing grade is not to complain that your diligence wasn’t rewarded. It’s to ask how you could have gotten a better return on your investment. Trying harder isn’t always the answer. Sometimes it’s working smarter, and other times it’s working on something else altogether. Every teacher should be rooting for students to succeed. In my classes, students are assessed on the quality of their written essays, class participation, group presentations and final papers or exams. I make it clear that my goal is to give as many A’s as possible. But they’re not granted for effort itself; they’re earned through mastery of the material. The true measure of learning is not the time and energy you put in. It’s the knowledge and skills you take out",Examination,Medium,1.0,web:pullpush:r/Professors:submission:complaint,Medium,2,6500,858,5,"Article from the NY Times: “No, You Don’t Get an A for Effort”.",0

"Asking to be addressed by their professional title is perfectly reasonable.

"Isolation. Feeling stuck guys. I've found myself in a situation where I literally have no one to talk to. Nearly a year and a half ago now I left my grad institution to pursue my dissertation research at an outside non-profit science organization in another (non-English-speaking) country. I was really excited about it at first as I was inspired by the mission of the organization. However, since coming here, I've found the work culture here to be not so much in line with the mission that's outwardly projected. The group I am working seem seems to hold up tradition, bureaucracy, and manual labor over science and innovation. In a recent set of interviews for a position that had opened up, the team I'm on turned down an applicant for ""being too ambitious."" Nobody ever talks about science, and why would they if the emphasis is on maintaining the status quo and physical labor is the only ""work"" that's seen as work? To make matters worse, I had a falling out with my group a few months ago. I tried to tell them that, while I'm happy to help with things at peak times, I can't be spending all of my time on these manual labor activities that don't have anything to do with my project. I realized that's all I had been doing for a year and figured I needed to stand up for myself and buy some time to do research. It was not well-received, and I've had loads of problems since. Folks withholding data from me, avoiding me, not communicating with me about my field work, etc. I do have a research mentor here, and he's great! The issue is now I'm at our fieldwork site for the next six months, and he doesn't come out here at all for work. He's also English as a second language and quite old, so our phone calls don't often amount to much. I get much more out of meeting with him in person, but I'm tied down here for the next six months due to fieldwork responsibilities. This mentor and my PI have set a deadline for me to have the first draft of a manuscript finished before Christmas. I'm still trying to crunch all of the data calculations morning and night while working in the field during the day. The problem is I literally have no one to talk to here. The scientists here have little expertise in the stats I've been tasked with, and they forwent thinking/talking about science long ago. There are zero other students here either and zero seminars I can attend. I sometimes try to connect with my cohort back at my university, but it's hard. Sure, maybe I can get a direct question answered over email, but what I'm missing is that chance to sit down and discuss my project. Shooting the shit about science. Checking out a seminar and having a chat about it afterwards in the office. I try to read papers when I can, but again, I have no one to talk about them with. I have so many results right now, they're a mess, and I can't see any story in them that I can tell. I have weekly calls with my PI scheduled, but he often cancels about half of them due to invited talks, conferences, special seminars, students' exams. I feel like I'm trying to do my PhD in a vacuum. Any ideas for how to cultivate some scientific interaction with little to work with? A semi-related request: tips for dealing with isolation more generically. Right now I'm in a rural community with very little going on. The community is very conservative and insular. The role of women here is more of girlfriends, wives, mothers, etc., so it's unlikely I'll find any like-minded gals to be friends with. I also don't speak the language super well. I have a bike and there is a park here, but it's too hot to be outside most of the time, and I spend a lot of time at work in the heat, so being outside is the last thing I feel like doing in my free time. My weekend activities right now are going to Walmart and Starbucks. Sometimes they have movies showing in English.

"Berlin student assistant interview - in person or remote. So I am an MA student in Berlin. I applied for a student assistant job a while ago and they want to interview me on 11.04. Now that is a bit of a problem because it clashes with the period my partner is on holiday (8-15), and I had almost decided to join her by travelling on the 10th when this news emerged. I asked them if they would be willing to do it on 9 or 16 April, and they said not really because they want to fill the position as soon as possible, but they offered to do a Zoom call on 11.04 instead. Somewhat confusingly, they also said if Zoom doesn't work for me then they would ""gerne"" find another date. So I think now I could either leave Berlin on the 10th and do the Zoom call the next day, either where my partner is staying or somewhere else, or I ask if they could move the interview to 09 or 10, though obviously 09 would be better if I still intend to leave on the 10th. I kind of lean towards the latter because I feel like doing Zoom might put me at a disadvantage (and I'm scared of possible technical problems), but potentially losing a day if I have to go on 10.04 is also meh (for context the travelling will very much be an entire day undertaking so yeah). Of course, I could go to the interview in person on the 11th, but travelling after then would effectively reduce my time away to two days. And I'm guessing, based on what they said, that they won't accept doing it after the 11th. Am I making sense? Am I right to be scared of Zoom, or is it maybe worth it? My partner and others I've asked seem to think that making them do the interview on a different day is more likely to put them off/disadvantage me more, but I'm not sure",Fees,Medium,1.0,web:pullpush:r/academia:submission:problem,Medium,1,1722,338,7,Berlin student assistant interview - in person or remote.,0

"Working Paper/ Complete Draft submitted for a Summer School. There is a summer school in Europe that was open for application, and its requirement was ""a full paper (working paper/complete draft)."" I have two versions of the paper that I wanted to submit; one is like complete complete (it is nice and stuff), and the other one is a revised version of the first one (I added a few stuff and one big section for robustness check).

"How to deal with pain from sitting at desks in class. Hi! I was just hoping that someone in a similar situation to me might have some advice. I've got an ongoing injury (both shoulders, currently in PT, but improvement is very VERY slow) and started school a few weeks ago. (Yay for returning to school as an adult with some fancy schmancy new body problems.) This week I realized that my shoulder pain has suddenly amped up by an astounding degree, and the main factor seems to be from sitting in class and taking notes. I asked my therapist for some advice but unfortunately the only real posture advice applies to home desks that you have control over and can change, not to crappy college desks. I can't exactly bring in a footrest and specialized cushions 😅 I haven't talked to disability services on this campus yet, but I'm not really sure what they could do for me anyway. Does anyone else with chronic shoulder problems have any advice of how they deal with classes? I handwrite all my notes but could swap to taking them on my laptop if necessary. The chairs in all my classes are about as cheap as they come, and none of my classes really have any tables where I could stand to take notes at.

"Did the damn thing! Submitted my first paper today. Some reflections. For the record I’m wrapping up my fourth year in a STEM PhD program (no masters). This is my first time submitting a manuscript for publication in a journal. Some reflections: **I actually enjoyed writing the first draft.** I’ve always liked writing and would like to think of myself as a decent writer. The process of writing the first draft proved to actually be a bit of fun for me. I enjoy how academic writing to so logical, clear, and orderly, and I sort of reveled in the process of making all of the puzzle pieces fit. **However, the enjoyment ended there.** Next came advisor edits. Coincidentally I have three advisors, who all had some substantially differing idea about how this or that should be annotated, where to move this piece, delete that piece, cite this paper, don’t cite that paper… Argh! The first round of edits from my advisors were the most difficult to trudge through, in part because there was just *so much* to correct, but also because there were parts of the results and discussion sections that needed to change significantly from their original forms. **The battle for corresponding authorship.** I had worked with one main collaborating scientist on all of the analysis for the entire paper. It’s a statistics-heavy paper, and this individual is a biometrician. He has a better understanding of the work than any one of the other co-authors, including my advisors. It made total sense for him to be the corresponding author, and all of my advisors and I were in agreement on it. However, at the last second, the leader of his group stepped in and told us we needed to select this other woman as the corresponding author. She has had very little to do with the paper, and she has minimal understanding of the vast majority of the methods. It made no logical sense but was very clearly a political/bureacratic move on the part of group leader. It has been difficult to work with this woman as the corresponding author because she knows so little about the research. **Co-author craziness.** I had a co-author ask to be removed from the publication. This was a person who had contributed to the research and should have been included on the publication. Even my supervisor told her she should be included as a co-author. However, over the past year there have been a number of blowups with her. Several months ago she emailed me telling me to not publish half of my results because she ""wanted to do some analyses with those datasets.” The research and datasets I would use had been agreed upon by my advisors and her supervisor over a year earlier, the research was done, and I was writing it up. Her attempted scoop got back around to her supervisor, and she got in trouble for it. Then recently her supervisor asked me to get a dataset from her (wasn’t actually “hers”) and try it out with an analysis method I was working on. She refused to share the data and started yelling, saying I was always “hoarding data” and “stealing projects” from her, while I was just trying to follow her supervisors instructions. Suffice to say she has been a difficult person to work with. Requesting to take herself off the paper was petty, but ultimately it only hurts her in the end. Most of the other co-authors didn’t have many changes to make to the manuscript, so that part of the revision process felt easy. Getting folks to respond was the hard part! We submitted the manuscript this afternoon, and I just received revisions from the last co-author this morning… **Splitting hairs.** I felt like it took *so much* time and effort to cross all the T’s and dot all the I’s in terms of getting all of the formatting correct for the selected journal. Use *et al.* for more than five authors, paragraph-initiating boldface for this section header, centered and all caps for that section header, no more than 35 characters for the running title, 10-point sans serif font for figure and table headings, etc. I wanted to gouge my eyes out. **Faulty journal submission platforms.** The journal submission portal was clunky and difficult to work around. Had to do many parts of it over again. Couldn’t copy-paste into boxes because the formatting made it look as thought the character counts were too high, etc. Frustrating. **Suggested reviewer awkwardness.** I asked around among co-authors for suggestions of folks whom I could list as recommended reviewers. One of my advisors was advocating for this guy I had overlapped with a few years prior at my institution while he was a research associate. He has put out some decent papers, but he’s a mess of a person. He used to leave work 2-3 times a day to go home and get high, and there were multiple instances when he tried to come on to me. He even tried to get me to go home with him once at a party, despite being about 25 years older than me. Ultimately I was able to get him off of the suggested reviewer list without having to divulge his past transgressions to my advisors/co-authors. **Still a long road ahead.** I’ve been working on this research for years now, and at this point I would like nothing more than to see this work in print and move on to a new project. The thought of there still being *months* left in the peer review process is a bit discouraging, and who knows how difficult the reviewers are going to be. Not trying to shade the peer review process, as I know how important it is. It’s just that I’m exhausted and ready to move on. Overall, I’m glad to have this first one submitted and will probably have a little celebratory drink tonight when I get home. Anyway, I just wanted to share my experience. It was messy, but it’s done. I’m hoping writing and submitting my next paper will go more smoothly. I’m more excited about that research, and the paper should be much less complicated to write than this one was, given the subject matter. Anyone want to share your paper writing/submission trials and tribulations? TLDR; Submitted my first paper for publication. Lots of challenges, but most fell into one of two categories: 1) splitting hairs about revisions, what to do when co-authors disagree, formatting for the selected journal, etc. and 2) political/bureaucratic issues among those involved",Faculty,Medium,1.0,web:reddit:r/gradschool:search:portal not working,Medium,1,6266,1097,6,Did the damn thing!,0

"Thinking of switching from a 4 year university to community college for dental hygiene, looking for advice. Hello yall, I’m currently a sophomore at a 4-year university majoring in Biology. I’ve got about a 3.1 GPA and 47 completed credits right now, and I’m taking 13 credits this spring to bring me close to 60. Most of what I’ve taken so far are gen eds. I originally planned to go to dental school and become a dentist, but I’ve realized how competitive, time consuming, stressful, and expensive that path is. I’m not sure if that lifestyle is realistically what I want anymore. I’ve been seriously thinking about switching directions and becoming a dental hygienist instead. The problem is my university doesn’t offer anything related to dental hygiene, so I’d likely need to switch to a community college program. I *think* some of my credits will transfer, but I’m not totally sure. I’ll be talking to an advisor after break to figure that out. Right now I’m registered for Calc 1 and Gen Chem 2, but those wouldn’t really matter for a dental hygiene program. I could swap into A&amp;P, which I would need, but part of me feels like sticking toward my bachelor’s is the “safer” option in case I change my mind again. I also keep hearing mixed things about dental hygiene, some people say it’s a great, stable, good paying job, while others say hygienists burn out and end up switching careers. I’m worried that if I go the associate’s route I’ll feel “stuck,” and would need to go back later for a bachelor’s if I ever wanted to pivot. At the same time, part of me still likes the idea of dentistry, but with my GPA, not much shadowing yet, and not many extracurriculars, I don’t feel confident in that path right now. I do plan to get shadowing hours this summer though. Basically, I’m really lost and don’t know what to commit to. Is switching from a university to community college for dental hygiene actually worth it? Does having “just” an associate’s really hold people back long-term? Or is finishing a bachelor’s the smarter route even if I’m unsure? If you’ve been in a similar situation or work in dentistry, I’d really appreciate honest advice. TL;DR: Sophomore bio major at a 4-year with a 3.1 GPA and around 47 credits. Taking 13 credits this spring semester to reach about 60.

The lab had entered into a program to make compounds and send them out for bioactive testing, so we had a quota for so many compounds per quarter. We were constantly pushed to get numbers as well as produce innovate research. My adviser would regularly call people hacks, threaten people's careers via bad letters of rec, and would throw things around the lab when people under performed. I was assigned to work under the new post-doc. I was chosen because no on else would work with him. He was openly nationalistic, racist, covert, obstructionist, and barely had a grasp of English. He refused to perform lab duties or participate in anything in the department that did not directly affect his research. I worked with him for several months developing methods and making compounds before going off the bench to prepare for my comps and oral exams (as was policy for the lab). During this time he took everything we worked on and with my adviser's knowledge, published without my name on the work. After I passed my orals we went into grant writing mode. The post-doc again was not involved. I was asked to get results from the him and he ended up getting so upset at this request he ended up hitting me. I was later forced to apologize for upsetting him because I was the grad student and he was a post-doc. I'm trying to put together my original line of research and move forward on publishing, but every group meeting where I talk about my experiments, this post doc says he's already done them. Any ideas I came up with or work I did was constantly sabotaged. Eventually we found out he was performing proposed experiments to get his name into everyone's work. He ended up having a shouting match with the PI and a fistfight with another post-doc because of this. So in my fourth year I lost my mind and had to take a leave of absence. I was in therapy and on meds, but no one seemed to really care. Both my grandfathers died within 6 months of each other. I got evicted from my apartment because the landlord pissed off the city. After I returned but the post-docs notebooks they were all in Chinese and in code so we couldn't read them. After another leave of absence I returned to leave with a 7 year Master's, my adviser promising that I could return in a few years and finish the program as another student of his had done. (BTW the post doc went on to another lab and pulled the same stunts and was fired within 6 months) I taught for 2 years, which was a very rewarding experience for me. Any professional job I interviewed for always asked about the 7 year Masters. I tried to get back into the program, but was denied. I ended up starting a new program at a new university to try and improve my situation. Here I was denied my first and second picks for lab. The lab I entered into had been closed for two years and everything was dirty. Again I got through classes fine, but struggled with research. My adviser refused to meet with me, refused to give me guidance, and refused to play any part in my graduate program. I coordinated primarily with the School of Graduate Studies to prepare me for my exams and make sure my paperwork was done correctly. I addressed this in my annual review of my adviser, but he forced me to change it to a positive review. In my 3rd year a capricious grading charge was brought against me by a student because of 1 point on a lab. I was found to be in compliance with regulations, but was put on probation because of the charge. Over my 4th year the department did nothing concerning assessing my probation status. At the end of the year I requested to be informed if I passed probation or would be terminated, but got no reply. After contacting HR the department had a meeting and said I was off probation, but admitted to not following the guidelines they had set. At this point SGS stepped in. They met with my adviser and he was unable to tell them what my thesis was, what his expectations were of me, or even what I had done in lab that week. A timeline was drawn up for both my graduation and my teaching assignments. My adviser met with me and said he would not comply with it. I met the goals for the first semester, but my adviser and the department did not. I gave him a negative review again and he tried to get it changed, but I stuck to my guns this time. At the beginning of this year I submitted another complaint. My committee met to discuss why things hadn't been done. My adviser said he knew nothing about a timeline or what I was doing. I then showed the e-mails when I was sending him my manuscripts and results. The committee was stunned. I had submitted a paper and it was accepted without his approval because he wouldn't respond to the e-mail. A new timeline was drawn up. He refused to comply again. Deadlines passed. I submitted an official grievance to the University. An investigation was held and he was removed as my adviser. When he was told this he came after me. The Dean personally stepped in. He determined the environment at the University was so hostile towards me it would be best if I worked elsewhere. I moved across state and wrote my dissertation with what I had done. My adviser was removed from research, removed from teaching, and removed from any other graduate committed he was on. He retired last month. He was not at my defense. I defended this week and passed. One of my committee members cried during my defense. Now I just have to do the edits. I have a entry-level job with low pay that I start tomorrow. I picked it because I like the people I will be working with. I turned down a better paying teaching position because I did not like the people who interviewed me. If I would have known the things I know now about how a student deserved to be treated I would have taken action in my first program, but that was a learning experience. I was not the only one struggling in both situations. I was not the only one to leave the first lab, and the second program is struggling with low graduation rates. Never allow anyone to mistreat you, call you names, or ignore your needs even once because then it will happen again. Professors are not all-powerful, they have people above them and sometimes need to be reminded of that fact. You have every right to speak up and if you're told not to, then report that as well. I couldn't have made it without a LOT of people helping me.

"Not sure if I should continue or drop out again. Hi! I’ve been lurking a bit but it’s my first time posting here. I’m on mobile so sorry if this post is a bit messy! I returned to community college after taking some time off and it has … Not been going well. I struggle with mental illness (BPD, depression, anxiety) and I’ve had constant on/off struggles with my education due to sudden “episodes” or hospitalizations. I don’t feel comfortable disclosing my exact age but I’m in my 20’s and my transcript is FULL of F’s and W’s + huge gaps from when I would drop back out of school for a year or two. (i’m also at an age where my classmates openly say i’m pretty old for a community college student) There are hardly any semesters where I actually pass all my classes with decent grades. It’s definitely not a good look and it stresses me out more anytime I think about how much I’ve screwed up my education and how much it’ll affect me when I do start applying to universities. I recently had another bad episode and I’m still struggling with extreme anxiety/paranoia and I’ve missed class for the past week or so because of it. Part of me is tempted to just drop my classes and try again next semester because I feel so mentally exhausted already and I don’t know how I’ll catch up on work I’ve been missing. The other part of me is terrified at the idea of having more W’s on my transcript. I do get accommodations for disability by the way (in case anyone is wondering) but my professors are only accepting of numerous unexcused absences and said they cannot accommodate for me being unable to turn in assignments on time because that’s unfair to other students…. which I understand of course. I just don’t know what to do right at this moment. I’m beginning to think maybe college just isn’t for me but I don’t want to give up on it entirely either. Is it just hopeless for me at this point?

"After 4 years and academic hell, I submitted my thesis and have a defence date. I did it! I have submitted my MSc thesis and have a defence date. I started my masters 4 years ago and after the second year got a great job opportunity, so continued working on it any time I wasnt at work. It has been in the back of my mind for two full years every time I relaxed and wasnt working on it. I have had over 15 drafts. My supervisors put me through the ringer so, so many times. One of them, a prof at my uni, is an old perfectionist who wouldnt even read my text for a year until all my figures were formatted (delete this border, change the colour of this graph etc) only to make me change everything multiple times because he thought of something else I should add. Every one of his students takes at least a year longer than they should because he is like this and because he takes on far too many of them. Some of his students never finish. My other advisor works for the government and was always too busy to read my drafts, but roped me into several government reports about my project that I was forced to spend tons of time on despite it lengthening my degree, even though I stopped getting funding 2 years ago. The only reason they worked on it recently was because I straight up told them how unfair they were being and how expensive it was to pay tuition when I didnt even attend the school anymore. My prof called it a mean email but still edited my stuff finally. Then when we finally had a draft we liked, my other non advisor commitee member who hates my prof advisor edit-destroyed the draft, and I had to spend two weeks on his edits while trying to also make sure I didn't set back all the progress I had made with my advisors. Combined, this has been a fucking nightmare and every time I have felt like my degree was within grasp, they made it impossible to finish. Every weekend I worked non stop on it didn't matter because they made me redo everything or ignored me. I have had so many breakdowns over this is it unreal. And now, it is done.

"Microaggressions, Macroaggressions, and Modern Racism in Higher Education (2018). **Access:** [https://drive.google.com/file/d/15JAHDLCceSF9dr1n3VryImRxs907bDYa/view?usp=share\_link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15JAHDLCceSF9dr1n3VryImRxs907bDYa/view?usp=share_link) **Key excerpts** **Research Findings on Racism in United States' schools: Qualitative Data** * I present and discuss qualitative data from the research I conducted about racism on college campuses. This data comes from a predominantly White Midwestern US school and a racially diverse US school in an urban area. * The intent of these questions was to generate in-depth responses about participant’s experiences with racism on campus as well as their view of their campuses’ racial climate. * Respondents were asked the following questions: (1) Please describe your experiences with racism on your campus; and (2) Do you think that your school provides a comfortable environment for culturally diverse groups? * The following themes emerged: anti-Black racism, anti-Asian racism, segregation, “reverse” discrimination, and racist jokes. **Anti-Asian Racist Sentiments, Microaggressions, and Macroaggressions** * Anti-Asian sentiments, microaggressions, and macroaggressions were common at both schools. * Asian students at both schools (and particularly the predominantly White school) endured anti-Asian racism, verbal harassment, liquid racism, anti-international antagonism, racist retaliation as a response to the critical mass of Asian students, and being blamed for White students’ underperformance. &gt;People hate Asians (White woman, 18, at a predominantly White school). People are most racist to Asians (White woman, 19, at a predominantly White school). People dislike Asians the most out of every race. People telling Asians to go home/making fun of their customs and speech (White man, 19, at a predominantly White school). * The first quote is one of the most profound in the study. It is a simple and declarative statement that captures the climate of race relations on the predominantly White campus. **Anti-Asian Racist Comments and Verbal Harassment** &gt;A week does not go by where I don’t hear something negative about my race. There are comments made every day…about the international kids. The way they eat, talk, smell, stick together, and other cliché generalizations of Asians. I’ve heard many comments about Blacks too, from mostly Whites. Rarely so \[do\] I ever hear negative comments about Whites. When I do, it’s about blondes (Asian woman, 21, at a predominantly White school). I’ve heard people make comments about other races. My friends are somewhat racist. I’ve had experiences where Asians were made fun of in front of me (they didn’t know I was Asian) (Asian woman, 18, at a predominantly White school). I get called bad names, and it hurts my feelings (Asian man, 18, at a racially diverse school). People usually call Black people the n-word and Asian people chinks (Asian male, 20, at a racially diverse school). * The first comment is incredibly disturbing but is unsurprising given the intense anti-Asian sentiment at the predominantly White school. At least once a week, the participant heard “something negative” about her race. Her experience was not uncommon. * Asian students on both campuses were inundated with verbal harassment and racist comments that were dehumanizing, humiliating, and embarrassing. * Such comments not only impacted the target’s mental and emotional health (as seen in the third comment), it fostered a climate that was generally hostile toward Asians. **Anti-Asian Liquid Racism** * Racist jokes are also referred to as liquid racism. Weaver (2011) uses the term liquid racism to describe the difficulty of identifying behaviors as racist, particularly when racist behaviors are presented in a so-called humorous way. Weaver (2011) explains that racist humor “… is fluid, difficult to collect or identify because it may escape or dissolve before it can be contained, and is explicitly encouraged or given coverage in mass media (252).” &gt;I notice a ton of racism towards Asians. Jokes which people know they will not respond to; stereotypes; rude comments; all around I feel that Asians are most targeted and that is not because I have \[an\] Asian background (many people do not even know I am) (Asian man, 18, at a predominantly White school). I’ve received racial slurs \[from\] White people before with no reasoning. People tend to make many Asian jokes but always claim I’m not Asian because I’m Filipino (Asian woman, 20, at a predominantly White school). I hear friends and people on the street downtown making racial jokes towards Blacks and Asians ALL the time (White woman, 19, at a predominantly White school). * Liquid racism is one of the most common and insidious forms of modern racism. “Jokes” are used to dispense racism in a way that allows the offender to hide their true intentions by saying they were simply being playful. Attempts to hold the offender accountable for their words and actions often result in targets, allies, and those investigating such incidents being charged with the difficult task of proving intent. **Anti-International Antagonism** &gt;Most people are bad to the international students (Asian woman, 19, at a predominantly White school). The only racism I have encountered was what I have seen others do and say to the foreign students usually from China (White woman, 18, at a predominantly White school). I observe a lot of racism aimed at Asian international students on campus (White man, 20, at a predominantly White school). Derogatory slurs about Asian exchange students (White woman, 20, at a predominantly White school). Some students in my class don’t want to discuss with me, I felt (because I’m Asian) (South Korean woman and international student, 21, at a predominantly White school). * International students, and particularly Asian international students at the predominantly White school, encountered a hostile and unwelcoming environment. * international students may find it particularly challenging to navigate a foreign school system and to find allies and support systems that can help them document, report, and overcome the challenges of racism. **Defending “White Territory” from Asians** &gt;The Asians are taking over this fucking school and can’t even speak English (White man, 21, at a predominantly White school). Chinese and Koreans come and don’t speak a word of English. They do not learn the language or customs because they make little or no effort to interact with Americans (White man, 22, at a racially diverse school). * The above comments are very hostile and aggressive toward Asian students. It is clear from the comments that these White students believe that there is a wrongful intrusion of Asians onto their “White” campuses and, in an attempt to preserve their territory, they are responding with hostility (Levin and McDevitt 1993). * Since there is a critical mass of Asian students at both schools, their visibility makes them clear targets for retaliatory hostility, microaggressions, and macroaggressions (Levin and McDevitt 1993; Stotzer and Hossellman 2012). **Curve Setting** &gt;Asians are categorized as smart and throwing off our grade curves (White woman, 20, at a predominantly White school). A lot \[of racism\] against Asian students because they make up a good majority of the university and set curves (White woman, 18, at a predominantly White school). * Asian students were accused of “setting the curve” or outperforming other students on exams and assignments. However, it is outlandish for any student to blame someone else for their academic performance. * Unfortunately, for some students, scapegoating, bullying, and engaging in anti-Asian microaggressions and macroaggressions are more appealing than taking responsibility for their own academic performance. **Racial Segregation on College Campuses** * Students at both the predominantly White school and the diverse school cited racial segregation as a major problem on their respective campuses. There is an assumption that a diverse school would be more integrated and that there would be a higher degree of interracial solidarity and positive interactions between racial groups. This is not the case. &gt;I rarely see different \[racial\] groups comingle… \[The school\] prides themselves on having many races of people, but no sense of community is visible. Asians hang \[out\] with other Asians, Latinos with other Latinos…I tried to be open, but I was shunned when I attempt\[ed\] to try to say “hi” (Latino man, 26, at a predominantly White school). \[On\] campus, I feel \[like\] people \[are\] divided by race, Asian with Asian, White with White (Asian woman, 20, at a predominantly White school). \[It\] just \[feels\] hard to step into the circle of Whites (Asian woman, 21, at a predominantly White school). I see a lot of discrimination and people choosing to be friends with people of the same race (White woman, 22, at a predominantly White school). Many races seclude/exclude themselves from others. Sometimes they hang out with the same type of people (Asian woman, 20, at a racially diverse school). Even though our campus promotes diversity, I feel that everyone is racially separated (Asian woman, 18, at a racially diverse school). * Self-segregation and isolation serve as protective mechanisms for students of color. Some students of color feel that it is safer (physically, emotionally, and psychologically) to separate themselves from the dominant group because of personal experiences, vicarious experiences, and the legacy of racism in America. **Research Findings on Racism in School: Quantitative Data** * The quantitative data comes from 2500 participants at a predominantly White institution and a racially diverse institution who filled out a survey that included scales and items related to racist microaggressive experiences, racist macroaggressive experiences, racist beliefs, post-racist beliefs, perceptions of campus climate, and cultural competence. * Major findings are as follows: 1. students of color experienced more race-based microaggressions than White students; 2. Black and Asian students experienced the highest levels of race-based microaggressions, and 3. students of color experienced victimization by members outside of their racial group at higher rates than White students—which underscores the violence and oppression that students of color experience both vertically (by Whites) and horizontally (by other people of color). * **Table 4.1: 81% of Asian students experience racist** ***macroaggression*** **at predominately white campus, 86% at racially diverse campus.** * **Table 4.2: 82% of Asian students experience racist** ***microaggression*** **at predominately white campus, 83% at racially diverse campus.** * These results are in line with recent literature that found, compared to White students, Black and Asian students reported experiencing more racial discrimination (Gomez et al. 2011). My findings are also in line with literature revealing that White male students are less likely to be victims of racialized violence (Perry 2010)",Examination,High,2.0,reddit:r/academia,High,2,11220,1695,5,"Microaggressions, Macroaggressions, and Modern Racism in Higher Education (2018).",0

"What to do if I feel like I'm lacking 1/3 references for a co-op opportunity. Hello, I'm applying to try and get an arts co op for the summer as an undergrad in Canada, but I only have two folks in mind that I'd definitely ask for a reference from. One is a prof I've had two classes with who knows me well, and the other is my employer. I'm just worried about who to put down as my third reference if I happen to get an offer, as I don't feel like at this point I could ask any other prof for a reference. I transferred to my current major last year, so I guess I haven't had too much time to build relationships with profs/sometimes had TAs and was doing well in these classes so I didn't care to go to office hours. Excuses aside though, the third prof I planned to take more classes with and eventually ask for a reference has suddenly gone on research leave + I couldn't get into a class with them last sem though I was 1st on the waitlist.

I *really really* don't want to, because I'd much rather build a better relationship with them/show them the kind of student I am overtime, but I'm not sure what else to do.

"Should I report a Professor for Misconduct. During this week, I encountered a situation involving one of my professors. In previous interactions with my professors, I have requested that content warnings be provided when material involving sexual violence is included in the curriculum, particularly in the context of film presentations. Firstly, it allows me to prepare for the content mentally, eliminating the element of surprise. Secondly, it lets me take any necessary anxiety medication, facilitating a more composed experience. This also aids in averting panic attacks. However, during the week mentioned above, the professor failed to issue a warning for a film screening not included in the school syllabus, catching me unawares. Approximately one-third of the way into the film, I began to experience a severe panic attack characterized by physical paralysis in my legs and arms, intense constriction in my neck and shoulders, blurred vision, and cognitive impairment. My initial instinct was to leave the classroom, but my physical state prevented me from doing so. It took approximately 20 minutes for me to summon the courage to exit the room and seek solace in the hallway, where I remained for approximately two-thirds of the movie's duration. Upon returning to the classroom, my professor solicited the students' opinions on the film and, to my discomfort, singled me out on multiple occasions. I verbally expressed my unease and suggested he ask someone else for their perspective, as I did not have a favorable view of the film. In response, he commented that he valued the opinions of students who adhered to a politically correct viewpoint. This comment prompted an emotional response from me. Subsequently, I felt compelled to remind him that I had requested a content warning, and he had chosen to disregard it. Overwhelmed and pressured to respond, I exited the classroom in tears. My professor followed me and attempted to place his hand on my shoulder as I hurried away. He later sent an apology email and continued to single me out after the incident. His apology said all the right words and was well-composed. That wasn’t the problem; it was the fact he singled me out in my class when I was showing apparent discomfort and continued to push for an answer five times back to back. I'm pondering whether or not I should file a report. I genuinely appreciate the professor and the class, and I wouldn't want to introduce any tension into the wonderful learning environment it offers. Nevertheless, I've been feeling uneasy in the aftermath of this incident for the past three days.

"Fired(?) from lab and I’m relieved. I need to vent about a frustrating experience I've had as a materials engineering student and undergrad researcher in an additive manufacturing lab. The lab was small, with about six members, including one graduate student who had as much research experience as the rest of us. Two of these members worked in a separate lab, effectively leaving three undergrads and the grad student. Not that it matters, but all of us are women, which was originally a nice thing for me. When I joined, two other PhD students and a master’s student were there, but they graduated soon after. They tried their best to teach us despite their busy schedules, and we managed to learn how to use the equipment. Our PI loved to go on and on about how he enjoyed the small lab and how we all got along well, how he wanted to foster that kind of environment, etc. All lies, LOL However, there were red flags with our PI from the start. Although he was easygoing and loved to joke around, he had a habit of gossiping and speaking poorly about others behind their backs, including students and faculty. He especially had a deep grudge against the department head, but I never understood why. Now I kind of question whether he was right to always speak badly of her. My PI was always very disorganized and inconsiderate of others' time, often running late or missing scheduled meetings. For instance, he would get annoyed and snappy at me over files I had already sent him months before or abandon his class responsibilities to chat with one of my coworkers in the hallway. Other instances of his childishness include inviting our grad student to a conference but leaving her stranded without paying the $500 entry fee, which had never been discussed beforehand. Additionally, he told her he couldn't pay her full-time, yet became jealous and resentful when she started working for another professor to receive her full stipend. Despite his flaws, he seemed to appreciate my work initially, and I believed we had a good rapport. However, I eventually realized he has a tendency to favor some students while belittling others. The real problems began when another student and I were tasked with helping the grad student with her thesis over the summer. We worked hard and successfully completed the project, even though the PI was rarely around due to personal commitments or something. He eventually used some of our data, combined with that of one of the previous grad student’s, to publish a paper, giving me a second author credit, which I appreciated. Who knows, maybe that alone makes all of this worth it. It was pretty exciting for me anyway. For the rest of the semester, we received little guidance from the PI, who was often too busy to meet with us. This lack of direction was especially hard on the grad student, who was on a visa and needed to publish to stay on track for graduation. The PI would send accusatory messages to another one of my coworkers, questioning her productivity despite the two of us working on various tasks around the lab. In Spring 2024, the PI returned and focused all his attention on this student who he had previously sent accusatory messages to; he basically gave her a solo project, ignoring the rest of us and calling us ""useless."" He neglected the grad student, who was struggling without his support. Meanwhile, the solo project student falsely claimed to be working late into the night and on weekends, creating a toxic environment. Up until this point, our lab had never had the expectation of logging hours, since we were not paid hourly. The majority of us worked in the lab in person, and there was flexibility with the hours. It was never a problem because we got our work done, but this student’s actions led to the PI sending us messages talking about “lack of lab attendance” even though he was never actually in the lab himself to see whether or not this was true. Tensions peaked when the PI asked me to assist the solo project student, who rudely dismissed my offer to help. This ended our friendship and left me feeling isolated. As you can imagine, it also made me feel kind of angry, because she was frequently complaining about how “overworked” she was. I should mention that our department is clique-y; there is a “cool kids table” inside the lounge, for God’s sake. This solo student was fairly close to these people, and after this disagreement, I was shunned by them, which took a toll on my mental health. Reminds me of a recent LabRats post. These were people who were sunny and cheerful and always greeting people in the hallway, but went strangely quiet when they saw you. I was never anything but nice to them; I am pretty quiet, but never do anything to offend anyone. In fact, I spend most of my time inside my lab. Maybe they saw this and thought I saw myself as “too good” to spend time in the lounge? Who knows. The other two people in my lab felt the same way, and I know for a fact that neither of them had done anything to justify this. This semester has been particularly rough. I was nearly homeless, missed classes, and failed a course I should have dropped. The PI was vaguely aware of my struggles but only reported me to the student welfare office over the holidays without offering any personal support. Whatever. Yesterday, I was abruptly removed from the group chat without any warning, leading me to believe I've been fired. The PI had previously assured us he would never do this without informing us first. Needless to say, it’s been radio silence since then. It's unclear if I was dropped (if I was actually?) due to my failed class or because I'm currently out of state for an internship, which I had informed him about well in advance. Despite saying it was fine for me to leave initially, he later punished me by taking away my chance to write an abstract for a conference, while giving the opportunity to a coworker in a similar situation. I’m just baffled. This guy is immature beyond belief. Not the first time he airs things out in the group chat, either. When one of the previous grad student’s seemed to be missing lab days a lot, the PI called him out there. In response, the student sent a very well-composed message talking about how he was coming in on at odd hours, making progress, and keeping records of the things he was doing, while suggesting that the PI implement measures to check on these things without aggression. The PI responded by deleting the messages from the group chat and not acknowledging them. Little surprise that this student was removed along with me yesterday, while the other grad student who has already graduated was allowed to stay. Is it bad to say I feel kind of relieved? I only mourn losing the income and research ability, but oh well. I know I’m not perfect, but I really cannot believe this guy is a tenured professor. Thanks for reading.

"How to ask for more attentiveness from my PI. I've been in my PI's lab for 3 years (first year was as an intern finishing a Masters, then as a doctoral student) and am generally very independent and self-directed. I like to figure things out for myself, solve my own problems, etc. As a result, I don't ask questions or ask for help very often but when I do it's because I've exhausted other possibilities and I *need* her input. The problem is she rarely gives it if I send something via email, Teams, put it in my weekly report, etc. If I'm not asking her a point blank question in-person she usually won't even respond. This isn't too bad since my desk is right outside her office so I can often get her attention in passing at which point she's happy to sit down and talk to me at length, but because she's often away for conferences or working from a second office elsewhere or working from home I can't always speak to her directly. She assures us in meetings she always reads our weekly reports, but she never answered questions or problems I put in my reports. So I started sending the report along with a specific question in the email if I had one. But then those weren't getting answered either. She reminds us all she's always available on Teams, but she near-never responds to me there either. To be clear, despite the way this sounds I don't get the impression she doesn't care about my progress or isn't interested in my work. If anything, I think that she thinks I'm capable enough to not need her attention so she doesn't give me any, essentially ""Ok, Ancient_Winter's weekly report is fine, I don't need to look at it closely, they're always on task"" sort of a thing, especially compared to the doctoral student who came in after me who seems to need a lot more guidance and time from her. One of the more capable interns, as well, is often ""forgotten about"" relating to our PI communicating with her in all but in-person mode. It's starting to become really frustrating though, because I'm trying to do things like coordinate meetings with her and a collaborator, or I'm trying to set up something for the lab I need her approval on, etc. and unless/until I can see her in person it's like I can't expect a response. She's out of town for a week now, and I have a few pending questions/issues that I've basically just had to assume won't be resolved until next week at this rate. They are often too specific to my project for weekly lab meetings, and our biweekly 1-on-1s keep getting cancelled (for everyone, not just for me) due to schedule conflicts. She's also, as you can probably surmise, very very busy. Lots of collaborations, has two offices in the building since she's basically overseeing her own lab + an institutional clinical data collection site. We're trying to hire a new coordinator, get some major equipment up and running, and we also just brought in two new doctoral students this week. (I worry she works too hard, sincerely, I adore her and I hope she takes care of herself but I try not to pry into her decisions!) I want to basically say ""I send you questions or bring up issues in my reports and emails but never hear back, and you often don't respond on Teams. I can't always come knock on your door. Can you please start being responsive to me via some form of electronic communication?"" except I don't want to be at all combative, whiny, accusatory, etc. ##**TL;DR:** PI leaves me to my own devices which generally works well, but when I need her she isn't responsive if I'm not standing right in front of her.

"Writing class grade. I'm taking a required writing course for my school this semester and to say it's been bullshit would be an understatement. The writing class, like many college writing classes, is based around opinions and interpretation(what could ever go wrong.). Anyways, that has nothing to do with the actual situation. Essentially, everyone in this course is required to write a total of 5 papers when it is said and done. My course instructor/professor is a relatively nice guys in terms of personality, but unfortunately he has been probably the LAZIEST fucking instructor I have ever encountered. I finished the course with a grade of a B as my final paper being the final determining factor. I was sure I would at least finish with a B+, if not an A, but my instructors' inability to return papers in time and be fair was what I believe made me fall short. A fellow student in the class that I am friends with received his fourth paper 2 weeks before our final paper was due(which comes along with instructor feedback), and so did many other students, while me on the other hand, did not receive his fourth paper until 2 days after our FINAL paper was due. My question is essentially pertaining to me wondering if I am just being a stickler or if I am valid in my concern that it is incredibly unfair to have a final paper due for every student while the majority of students have received feedback for their previous paper(as my instructor claimed) and a select few such as myself have not. Each paper follows a similar format and so I truly believe having the feedback on my fourth paper would have helped. Additionally, my instructor fucked me earlier on the fourth paper itself. Our fourth paper was required to be submitted in two parts in which one was a rough draft and the other was the final version. I messed up on my part and submitted the wrong file for the rough draft and I explained my situation to my professor and he allowed me to resubmit and said he would provide me with feedback over the weekend. I EXPLICITLY asked if he wanted me to email him reminding him of my rough draft in case he forgot over the weekend, to which he responded that there was no need. Surely enough, I never received the feedback he claimed he would give me, and while he was nice to give me a chance and offer feedback, he should not tell me he is going to do something only to fuck me once again. So now I will ask the same question, am I being a stickler or do I have a valid reason to email him with my concerns and dispute my final grade for the course on the basis that he has not been fair this semester/consistent with how he has handled paper grades and feedback. -Also, the site that my college uses would allow one providing grades for a course to not publicly release them to any students until all grades and feedback are provided. -I wish I could provide a TL;DR version but I think that would leave holes in my argument",Academic,Low,0.0,web:reddit:r/college:search:unfair grading,Low,0,2943,542,0,Writing class grade.,0
"Facing sexual harassment from a recruiter. I'm not sure how to proceed. For background, I'm a female PhD student in a STEM program. At my department a lot of major companies recruit for summer internships and jobs in my field and the internships are very important for future employment opportunities in the industry. This past September, a recruiter--I'll call him Jim--from one of the companies called me on my personal cell phone (which he got from resume) and asked me out on a date and said some inappropriate things to me after my interview. I said no, of course, and told him that I was happily in a long term relationship of 5 years and asked him to leave me alone. I was never explicitly promised an internship with the company, but he hinted that he would put in a good word anyway, even when I told him not to. 'Jim' texted me for a few weeks, but I didn't respond and I thought that was the end of it. I did end up getting an internship with 'Jim's' company, but I turned it down and went with another company that also offered me a place because the whole situation felt very weird. 'Jim' stopped trying to contact me and I thought that was the end of it. I didn't report the situation to anyone because I thought I had taken care of it. This past week, the same company 'Jim' works for invited about 15 people from my department (professors and students) for dinner. I went because one of my advisors asked me to go and I didn't think it would matter much as I doubted 'Jim' would be there. Well, I was wrong. He cornered me while I was coming back from the restroom and said some really inappropriate (sexual) things to me along with telling me that I had been invited because he had pulled strings and he really wanted to see me again, that I should be thankful to him, that he'd talked to his bosses and they would still give me a placement, etc. I tried to be civil, but I was incredibly angry at this point and I just left the dinner. 'Jim' has been texting me and has tried to call me a few times since then. Right now, I'm ignoring it until I can figure out what my next step should be. I've never returned any of these advances nor have I given 'Jim' reason to think that I would return his feelings. The company is one of the largest in the world and fund quite a bit of research in my department (luckily not mine). My department relies on them and the recruiters are important to the departmental relationship with the companies as they're alumni from the school (usually). They give the department quite a bit of money for a lot of things, actually. I'm also in my first semester and just came to this school so I'm worried about being seen as a trouble maker, I suppose. There aren't that many other females in my field and I've had to face things like this before, but it's usually been from peers. There's never been this huge power differential and I feel exploited. I've talked to my boyfriend and a few close friends about it and they believe I should first talk to my advisors (who I do trust very much) and then possibly the department chair, but I'm not sure. Has anyone out there been in a situation like this? I'm just not sure if I should report this or exactly how to navigate the situation. Any advice you could give would be really, really appreciated. Edit: Thank you guys so much for responding to this. I know I haven't responded to everyone, but I have read each comment and I thought I would post an edit with what happened today. I called my advisor today and met with him about it after waking up this morning to some other lewd and pushy text messages. I decided it was the last straw as obviously this man is not taking ""no"" for an answer. My boyfriend was able to get back all of the text messages I had deleted from when this first started in September and I showed them to my advisor. He was absolutely livid, but luckily *not* as over-reactive as I was afraid he would be--and called the department chair who then contacted people within the company as well as a few administrators on campus. Even the department chair--who is friends with 'Jim'--was angry and very supportive, especially since I had documented proof. I'm having to file a formal complaint to the company right now and on Monday I also have to meet with my school's Affirmative Action Office (and possibly Student Affairs) to file another complaint. The people at the company with whom I spoke were also supportive so my fears were hopefully unfounded. I'm not sure what the end result of this will be, but hopefully it will stop 'Jim' from doing this to anyone else. If anyone ever has anything happen to them like this (or are going through something similar) my best advice is to document everything and speak up I wish I would have told someone what was going on sooner.

"The University I went to Sucked Bad. The University I went to (Cal State University Bakersfield) has to be one of America's worst Universities. Everything about this place sucked hard and I'm tired of pretending it didn't. I came hoping to make friends and have a social life, but I did not make one single friend at this University. I thought I'd meet a girl and have all the firsts I missed out on back in high school - first kiss, first dance, first date, etc. None of that happened, no one here wanted to date at all, or at least not date me. Every girl either already had a boyfriend or wanted to ""focus on studying"" as if its impossible to study a few hours a day and still date. In general I thought there'd be parties, people wanting to have fun, etc., but nothing. Everyone at this school kept to themselves, everyone walked around with their faces glued to their phones or wearing headphones. No one was willing to make small talk or be social here AT ALL. I spent years prior going to the gym, getting in shape, upgrading my wardrobe, practicing up on social skills, etc. coming in with the expectation of making new friends to hang out with and get to date, but nothing. It was the opposite actually, I felt like I still couldn't fit in, like the people here still didn't want to talk to me. I was actually bullied on many occasions even worse here than back in high school. I was called ""gay guy"" as an insult depite being straight, and had students gaslight me into thinking I was doing bad during group projects, people taking credit for my work, etc. And the Professors were never any better. They often mocked and criticized me, the assignments were boring, and I don't feel like I left this Uni being any smarter than before. I feel like I actually LOST brain cels by going to this school, and I never even picked up a single drink. The Professors constantly gave me unecessary trouble, I had a year-long lawsuit occur between Professor Barbara Bartholomew because she falsely accused my of plagiarism on an assignment and expressed sexism against me (giving everyone else in the class besides me and another boy an A while failing us). This made me fall back an entire year of school, and during the final hearing she STILL had no evidence that I plagiarized. The school forced her to give me a C for the class and she was not penalized or fired at all. The events and clubs here all sucked. Low attendance, people on their phones or being hyper introverted (and this is coming from an introvert myself), etc. No participation from anyone. Overall, the worst five years of my life were wasted at this awful school. No friends, no dates, no fun, no learning, no good clubs and orgs, zero incentive, and I wasted a Hell of a lot of money for a stupid degree I never even wanted just because my parents forced me too. I hate this damn school and hope it loses as much funding as possible, and hope the entore school pays for the Hell I had to go through. X) I went in with the upmost optimism. I escaped an abusive father, escaped being part of a religious cult, practiced meditation, self-awareness, and satisfaction, plus use to go to the gym everyday, eat healthy meals everyday, etc. I had optimism I could start over fresh and had faith that the world was a great place, that University would give me many role models to look up to, friends to make memories with, and potential dates and love interests.

"I have a PhD in political science from a university off your list and teach it at a school you’ve probably never heard of except once a decade they make the NCAA tournament…. Long story short, I don’t encourage anybody to do grad school in the social sciences anymore, but I’ll give you some advice anyway. The job market in academia is bad, and seems especially bad in the social sciences. When I started, my department was a top ten in some areas. They had nearly a 100% tenure track placement record for their PhDs. I graduated into the recession and got a TT, but suddenly, lots of good people were stuck adjusting, and finally, the market never recovered. There are some good jobs out there, but the competition is fierce. A job like mine has security, but the pay is shit and you’ll probably end up living somewhere that sucks. And being an adjunct is just awful, and extremely common these days. Basically, if you’re going to do it, you need to be super driven and one of the top students out of one of the top programs. And even then, it’s a crapshoot. For grad school, pedigree matters a lot, as does the specific faculty you’ll work with in your niche. For undergrad, it doesn’t matter that much where you go so long as it is a reasonably well regarded place. Pretty much anything on your list is fine, as would any flagship state school or reasonably highly ranked private. More important, look at campus vibe (some people and campuses are a better fit than others). If there’s a specific niche you care about, make sure they teach classes about it. And look at price. I’m not confident PSLF is going to be around much longer, and taking on a bunch of debt for a lousy salary is a bad idea. As others have said, think about why you want to do this. Getting a PhD is a pretty miserable experience, and being a professor needs to be intrinsically interesting enough to offset the many downsides. You really need to be passionate about research on a particular topic, as that’s what the job is really about, even pre tenure at teaching focused schools. The other issue is that a polisci PhD is close to worthless outside of academia. STEM PhDs have a leg up on industry jobs. Social science PhDs don’t. I think majoring in polisci is a great thing for an undergrad. Do that, see if anything really sparks your curiosity, and if it does, come back here in 3 years so I can remind you not to get a PhD in political science",Academic,Medium,1.0,web:pullpush:r/AskProfessors:comment:placement,Medium,1,2428,447,0,I have a PhD in political science from a university off your list and teach it at a school you’ve probably never heard of except once a decade they make the NCAA tournament….,0

I'm lucky in that my part time work has been a combo of working the bar in my university's SU, teaching in my department and also teaching at another university which is nearby. My advice would be: *Are you able to find work nearer to your university to cut down on the physical (and mental) exhaustion? Nearly all Universities seem to need PhD students to act as teaching assistants or demonstrators depending on your subject. Are you teaching? If not, could you speak to your supervisors about opportunities? *Even if you can't get teaching, there are other opportunities on campus a lot of of the time. Most if not all SUs recruit students for bar work or cafe work. It can be a bit mundane but it pays the rent. Additionally, many Universities are on the look out for part time RA roles. It's worth keeping an eye in your University job portal or similar for any roles. *Have you spoken with your supervisors about the impact this is having on you? If not, I would. They can explore options with you that range from going part time to meet flexible deadlines. *You mention a family. Have you looked into any support your University offers for students with dependents? I can't speak for all universities but mine offers additional financial support for student carers and student parents. You can contact your SU for info. More generally, I'd say I get it.

"How should I respond to passive aggressive email from my professor after asking for clarification on an assignment. Right now I’m in an asynchronous online course. We have a final presentation due in two weeks and I had a question about two guidelines that seemed to conflict. She included an example presentation, but it conflicted with the requirements. She said we needed 6 sources in our annotated bibliography, but the slides shown used 1 source per slide (for 3 slides). I emailed and asked her if all 6 sources needed to be present in the slides as well and this is the email I got back “ I went over the presentation yesterday and last week in class. The example PPT does not use the same reference. Three references are required, and the reference slides reflect this, as noted in the citations. I recommend you take another look at the example and/or see the Psychology tutor.” 1. As I said I’m an asynchronous student. There are 2/3 optional zoom sessions that took place this semester but the last one was listed in the syllabus as being on October 7th. 2. I looked at the example and that was what confused me.

"Weighing the relative importance of PI fame vs. PI mentorship for a postdoc seeking a career in academia. Hi all, I’m finishing my PhD soon (UC Berkeley MCB) and in the market for postdoc positions. I’m currently weighing two offers from different labs at UCSF and am stuck on the issues of PI fame versus PI mentorship. Lab 1 is huge, famous, and publishes several articles in C/N/S per year due to extensive collaborations with industry and academia. However, the articles often contain 20+ co authors, so that not every postdoc gets a first author publication, and the Lab 1 PI (while nice) is not super active in mentoring trainees due to demands on his time from collaborators and the size of his lab. Lab 2 is less prominent and smaller but sufficiently funded and publishes frequently in good journals and collaborates extensively within UCSF; most trainees leave with at least one or two first author publications. Furthermore, the Lab 2 PI is famous within UCSF for her active mentorship and taking a great deal of time to foster her trainees’ development and careers. I am interested in a career in academia. However, everyone seems to have a different take on the relative importance of PI fame versus mentorship when it comes time to apply for faculty positions (obviously the science you do is most important, and I think both labs do excellent work; Lab 1 is just a bit higher tech and in a field that is currently very hot which makes C/N/S publications easier to achieve). As people with experience in these matters, how do the users of this sub feel that the relative importance of the PI’s prominence versus their ability to mentor their trainees contribute to success during hiring for faculty positions?

"Please Choose Affordable Textbooks—There is a Predatory Textbook Rental Program At Colleges Affecting Low Income Students. First off, I thank anyone reading this. I’ve encountered inspiring professors during my college career who are passionate about the subjects they teach. I’ve only had good experiences and it is because of their dedication to teaching. In my experience, while the administration might be indifferent to my plea, professors care. That’s what inspires me to write this. This is an open plea to any professor taking the time to read this. Please choose affordable textbooks. Please tell your fellow professors to do the same. If you have any sway in this decision making process, please do what is ethical. It’s already well known that most textbook prices are insanely inflated. These are mainly textbooks that are required, mostly for courses students are required to take—the 101 classes. Each book can cost hundreds of dollars. Please allow me to explain how a new predatory book rental program at college bookstores take advantage of this. These bookstores on campus offer a discounted price to rent grossly inflated textbooks. The only article I could find on these programs was from 2013, praising its implementation, lamenting how much money students would save. Finally, there would be an answer to the textbook dilemma. I’m writing to let you know that this is an irresponsible take on the program. It’s predatory. I attend a community college in a low income area. When you search for a book on their website, the first option that comes up is for a rental. If you’re barely scraping by, this option looks good. Sixty dollars instead of 164? Sounds great. The catch is that you need to return the book right after your last class. The window for return is incredibly slim, perhaps purposefully so. I contacted other community colleges in the area, the policy was similar. Return after your last class. But what happens if you have a night class that ends at 10pm and the bookstore closes at 7pm? Your card is charged the full list price for the book. Plus a $25 non returned book fee. That’s over $200 for the $164 book when taxes are added. This is a devastating setback for any low income community college student. And community colleges offer tons of night classes. When I went to the bookstore to challenge this policy, the “past due” list they looked my name on was pages long, double sided. That’s hundreds of students for one semester. If you don’t teach at a low income community college, your textbook choice still matters. Community colleges work with universities to meet transfer standards. This means the university has a big sway in which books are used not only at their college but at several others. Your textbook decision could mean that, somewhere down the line, a low income student won’t be able to continue on next semester because their rental book cost was greater than the cost of a class.

"Mental Road Blocks. Hey all, I’m essentially done with my MA program in Anthropology (cultural), aside from doing the field research and submitting my thesis. Problem is, ever since I’ve gotten to this point I have hit non-stop mental road blocks (along with topic-based ones). I cannot convince myself to do anything productive related to my proposed research for my thesis that my advisor has already basically approved. Since its community based and the community has completely changed (and I’ve removed myself from it), I’ve lost all interest in my work. I’m just not sure what to do. At this moment, the program only has a thesis option for the degree (though I’ve been told by my advisor that a non-thesis option has been in the works). Do I try to wait it out and see if this ever comes to fruition? I’m pretty sure I would only need to take exams since I’ve completed all coursework (plus an extra elective, and possibly more as I might be working toward a grad certificate fot LDT). I feel like swapping programs would be an absolute waste of my time and money considering the point I’m at, but I also feel stuck because of this. Anyone else in a similar boat? What would you or have you done if so? My options are basically defer for a few months for mental health, apply for the grad certificate in LDT and focus on that temporarily, change programs, suffer and push through the issues, or drop out.

Because of my mental health (depression, lethargy, social anxiety, etc), I dropped out the last whole semester with retroactive withdrawal (in progress right now). I tried to overcome it this semester, but unfortunately, lethargy made me quit the study for the first time the semester. I just didn't want to do anything, so I just lay down (I slept more than 12 hours a day) and was lethargic even when I was awake. The first semester was ruined by mental problems, but if the second semester is like this, I really think my life has no answer, so I wanted to cure the disease, so I asked the school for help and received counseling, and it improved to some extent. However, in the second test, I foolishly set the proctorU wrong, so I lost the test time received by 1.5 times and took the test in panic. I was depressed for several days after taking the exam. At this point, I thought about giving up everything, even though I got a good grade on this test. I still don't know if I'm qualified to stay in graduate school. I want to do well, but my body and mind don't follow, so I don't know what to do. I have one final left, and I am not sure I can do well. It doesn't seem impossible to take a break and start over. If I drop the whole year with retroactive medical withdrawal, I can drop it with W, which does not affect my GPA. However, I have already lost a lot of my confidence, and I feel like a failure.

"This is an automated service intended to preserve the original text of the post. *Hello, I'm relatively new to this community! I'm a current senior working on a thesis project and I am running into a problem with a professor. For context, our thesis has two advisors - one that works witth us 1-on-1 and another that oversees everyone's theses (I will refer to this position as the supervisor rather than advisor). In this post, I am talking about the supervisor. The problem stems from a sub-quality paper I submitted this semester. It was a short assignment, no more than 5 pages. No, I wasn't accused of plagiarism or Chat-GPT, it was simply just not the best writing/research, and I do agree with the supervisor that I could have worked on it harder. No issues there, and I agreed to work harder. I thought this was the end of the discussion. My next three assignments, I worked extremely hard on and it showed in the feedback, which was mostly positive. But my issue stems from the fact that the supervisor keeps bringing the past paper up each and every time. For every subsequent assignment, the first piece of feedback he would give is ""this is much better than your sub-quality ___ (assignment title omitted for privacy) paper."" The supervisor even went so far as to bring it up in front of a classmate, saying ""I hope you don't mind me saying this in front of ___, but you finally got your act together!"" They also said something along those lines in front of my 1-on-1 advisor. it's honestly pretty hurtful at this point. That was one single poor paper out of the many other ""good"" papers I have submitted before and since then, so I don't understand why it has to be brought up every single time. Am I overreacting?

"Special ed teacher snapped at me for something I didn't do. So, this happened when I was 9. It was recess so me and my friends decided to hang out at the basketball courts. We had this kid (I'll call B for short) at our school who was apart of that special needs class for kids with behavioral issues and had to have assistance by a teacher (I'll call her ST for short). I was actually good friends with B since we've had many classes together. So, B and his friends came over to the basketball court where my friends and I where, and started to socialize with my friends. I noticed he was there but I was too focused on playing basketball. Now, from what I'm aware, I guess one of my friends did something that caused B to cry and throw a tantrum. That same friend came over to my basketball game and jumped in. Now, in comes ST. ST noticed that B was crying and ran over to help him. He couldn't speak that well and ended up pointing to our basketball game when ST asked who did this, and for some reason she thought I had done it. She had always had something against me and I never knew why. So, in her complete rage, she ran over to me and grabbed my arm so hard I was telling her to stop, and she dragged me back to the school.

So, quick backstory, at the time of this my mom left my dad with me cause he would constantly abuse her and me, and when he abused me, he would confront me and degrade me, just like ST was doing. This caused me to break down screaming in terror and yell for help. No one came over though sadly. ST ended up taking out her radio and called the front office to come and ""take me away,"" but luckily my former 1st grade teacher saw what was happening and ran over to stop ST and calm me down.

"Should I bring up issues in a group project with my professor. I’ve been working on a group project for the past few months now. It is for a very demanding and difficult class, and I’ve spent more than 100 hours this semester on this project. We have the opportunity to indefinitely keep working on it if we want, but it would be for research purposes only (the project has important implications if we do everything correctly), not for a grade or for a class or for anything. At first, I was very excited for this proposition, we all were. But i began thinking about what that would mean for me. There is this guy in my group who’s very unpleasant to work with. He constantly talks over everyone, he speaks aggressively to you if you have a disagreement, and if he has his mind set on an idea, he’ll do it no matter what you say (we’ve gotten points off on an assignment because of an idea he had, despite my adamant disagreement). He’s made my other group members uncomfortable and one of them is particularly sensitive and they’ve argued a few times before. The part that makes me mad the most is that, this dude does almost no work, especially recently. We had to write an assignment that was more than 60 pages long, and I wrote the majority of that assignment, and he didn’t contribute (neither did my other team members, apart from one). We also had a bunch of other stuff to do, and I’ve been the one doing most of it. I keep having to remind them of things, asking them when they’re available, begging them to do their work, etc etc. I am tired and I was comforted by the fact that this would be over in a few months, and I didn’t think it was worth it to make waves especially because this project was going to be finished in a few days. Because of how outspoken he is, my professor thinks he is the “leader” of our group, and he’s pulling his weight. Additionally, he has brought up issues he had with us to our professor in the past, while we haven’t said anything about the things he has done. He doesn’t know what’s going on most of the time.

"To many times I grant an extension to one student and three other come to me and complain I let so and so do XYZ"" Agreed, its frustrating but I make it clear in class that anyone who comes to me with questions is between me and that student. I will grant accommodations on a case by case basis (which means maybe 1 other students has a valid reason but I will happily tell the other 2 no). "" I’m not going to give you extra credit to help your grade with your peers have been working hard to earn theirs."" Agreed, I grant extra credit to the class sometimes, but other times its again, case by case basis. If a students hasn't been showing up (if my class is face to face, I also do online), doing the assignments, etc. I will tell them no. I have a student who shows up every time, is trying their best and just having trouble, I will happily give them extra credit to turn that C into a B. (provided they do it) ""But the other kicker is—I want them to learn the material so much I allow late work for any assignment (except tests) up until the last day of the class—for a late penalty. I ONLY do this in my intro class because it is foundational to upper level courses AND I do a cumulative final. They won’t do well on the final if they never did the work from earlier units."" Again agreed, I have quizzes and assignments that they can turn in late if they so choose but I warn them that they won't want to have work snow ball on them in the course (of course some do it and ask me for help.). But I also have it in the syllabus and I remind everyone a week before, that some things (assignments) must remain sacred. Mid-terms, larger research papers, so on. I give NO leeway on this, they can ask me, I will simply say no. (unless they have a valid excuse or prior accommodations approved by the university). I think overall we agree. But the premise of this post isn't about if we are being fair or equal. It is ""should students be encouraged to think ""no harm in asking"" is ok"" For me, for the reasons I listed, I still say yes. We as professors, are preparing them for the working world. All I can say is my own experience (I work in the tech industry). Simply doing what you're told and following processes with no questions will not get you very far. As unfair as it may seem, the people who push boundaries might ruffle the most feathers (as it seems to be happening to you), but in the long run, they tend to make it the farthest. I am of course Bias because I teach Leadership development/ Management. Leaders are the ones willing to question things, the ones willing try to demand/convince you into changing your mind, even if they have been told the rules before hand. You as their leader, have every right to simply tell them no (and you should if they are not following your rules). But trying to discourage them from asking is a little bit of a disservice. I am not judging, I totally understand how frustrating it is, but I also had to realize, in the real world, their willingness to be so bold will serve them well so I can't get to mad at them.

"Take easy classes to meet degree requirements to speed up graduation or take challenging classes that are relevant to career and delay graduation. I am looking for advising help. I am currently pursuing my masters in computer science and I also work full time. So far, I have completed 7 classes including this semester, and I have 3 more left. For the 3 remaining classes, I am in a dilemma and not sure what is the best course of action to take. **OPTION 1:** Take 3 x 1 class a semester and delay my graduation. See schedule below. The 3 classes are going to be beneficial from a learning point, but will be challenging. The Service API will be tough because currently, I am taking Enterprise Java and the professor who’s teaching has made this semester very challenging (and doesn’t help students that much). As far as Hadoop, I don’t know anything about this class but am interested in learning. Same with Angular, this is something that's interesting and want to explore this option. * Service API Design (Spring MVC) * Big Data Processing using Data Hadoop (Apache Hadoop platform) * Front end Web Development (Angular.js). **OPTION 2:** Take 2 classes either summer or fall semester, and then 1 final class to graduate. See schedule below. I believe the object oriented design class might be easier, as it is mostly diagrams, documentations, quizzes, discussions and a group project (no coding). I should be able to pair this class with another one. And software patterns has weekly coding assignments in C++ (which I don’t know but I may have to ask whether I can do it in Java). As for the XML class, I don’t know what this is but the professor is very good. Database class, I am interested but have heard the professor is tough and doesn’t help students that much. * Software Patterns * Object Oriented Design * XML Design OR Principles of Database **What would you recommend in my situation?

"Little to no instruction since week1 of class. I have this professor that ran into some visa issues resulting in him having to teach the class remotely from his home country. There was supposed to be some supplemental instruction from a GTA familiar with the course topic but she has been just as confused and lost as us students enrolled in the course. There's a huge lack of communication from the professor to us students but especially with the GTA that's supposed to be leading instruction resulting in our 3 hour class block every week to be cut short by 2.5 hours because the GTA has to admit they have no idea what is going on. The professor lives 10 hours ahead of us meaning there are some tight windows during the day to even get a response from them. In the past few days he announced our next exam via teams, which we use for all course communication/announcements prompting some students to reply asking where the feedback from our first exam is. He had further said he does not keep track of any notes or feedback for each exam and that our assignments are graded automatically by some Python script he made and that if any students want feedback they should attend his office hours at the end of the week (after exam2). This prompted me to respond that it's a bit absurd to expect us to commit additional time outside of class to get feedback that should have been included with our grade especially when our given time slot is not utilized already. This resulted in him going on about how I shouldn't make judgments in our open teams class chat and muted me from replying or posting in our class chat. I've had similar open criticisms earlier in the semester as well which also prompted other students to chime in and voice frustration but I was a bit more blunt this time. ~11 weeks in and we have not had really any formal instruction or guidance on assignments and exams, the undergrad dean in our department doesn't really seem to care, and pretty much no learning has occurred this semester.

"[Rant] I feel like my parents are trying to force me to apply and go to schools I hate over the school of my dreams. Hello, a2c Does anyone else feel like their parents are trying to relive and force their own values onto you? For me, I've always loved the University of Florida, and it's been my dream school ever since I learned about it. To that end, I've spent high school trying to optimize for the University of Florida. I've taken 21 AP exams in my first three years of high school, but only the ones that UF accepts for credit, and have dual enrolled 30 credit hours so far (in the past 2 semesters) at local universities, just so that I could transfer credits to UF. My plan this whole time was to triple major at UF (microbiology, mathematics and chemistry) and graduate in 2 years, and then move on to study biophysical chemistry and its interdisciplinary applications. For a while, this plan I came up with was fine with my parents. Then, I did really well on a bunch of standardized tests (SAT/subject tests) and my parents started reading prepscholar. Now they've gotten the idea that I NEED to go to MIT/Harvard/Stanford. While they haven't been forcing me to apply, they've sort of passive-aggressively told me about where I should and shouldn't go. For instance, my family and I wrote a pro/con chart on the different schools that we were looking at, and they wrote almost all cons about UF, and all pros about every school in the top 10, which I only had complaints about. They are always forwarding me emails, trying to get me to do interviews, and everything else. This last week, they sent me up to the northeast to look at schools, scheduled a bunch of tours, and had me go around that entire region of the country to look at the schools that they wanted me to see. I know a lot of you are probably really interested in applying to some of the schools that I despise, and feel like having parents who are willing to do so much to help you apply is amazing, and that I'm being ungrateful, but I just really don't have any interest in an ivy league/other elite school. I feel like my parents are trying to do their best to help, but on the other hand I feel like they're trying to make me live the life that they want me to live, and not the life I want to live. I feel conflicted and confused, and I'm not even sure what I want anymore. I'm wondering if any of you feel the same way. Do you all also have parents who want you to go to a college that you have no interest in? Is anyone else so done with this name brand frenzy that hey want to only apply to a state school? Is anyone else so fed up with the admissions process, and the ceaseless ""encouragement"" from everyone around them that they just want to apply to a few ""bad schools"" as a fuck you to everyone else trying to make you into something you're not?

"I had a full ride scholarship at a state college and a guaranteed spot in medical school to become a Physician Assistant. My parents were so proud of this scholarship and my future and after I got my first C, which ended up being in anatomy, I realized that's not where I wanted to be. I ghosted my classes and eventually dropped. The conversation with my parents was brutal and I had to spend the next 6 years being called a failure and drop out. The key is sucking up your pride and rolling with the punches. I do not feel they handled the situation very well but they were ultimately my parents and I was willing to take the verbal harassment and let it fuel my desire to find my own way. I had been working as a CNA to get experience in the medical field. I ended up going full time to be able to live on my own. After a year, a business office manager position opened up at the nursing home. At this point I was almost resigned to staying in the CNA role my entire life as I didn't have that much confidence in what else I could do. All the higher jobs felt like they came with too much responsibility and there was no way I could handle it or even have a chance. Some of my close friends encouraged me to go for it and I ended up getting the position. I learned so much in this new position, mostly about myself and what I could do. It also showed me my passion for business and information technology. I went back to school and completed a business degree. I still was called a drop out but I kept moving forward. After five years I realized I wanted to move into IT. I left to join a help desk position at a local computer shop. This was a significant pay cut and the job was very unorganized and stressful. Six months later I found another big break in a project management position. I worked hard and was very liked by my coworkers. A year later showed another opportunity and I made it to a full time IT position as a portal administrator. I am now working on my masters and getting into some major software development projects. My family is now in awe of my career and complain that I was born lucky. Believe in yourself and always be looking for opportunities. Looking back I would have taken advantage of internships, fellowships, and the like. Those will create amazing experiences and teach valuable lessons.

"Unreasonable workload in an undergrad research project. Last week, my research advisor told me to create a simple simulation for our project over the weekend. The project is to span the entire academic year and we have four other researchers on our team, each with a different speciality. The goal of the whole project itself is to create a computer simulation of a complex phenomenon and to analyze it. It feels like I’ve been asked to do something so massive that was supposed to take months of collaborating on my own, despite it being a “simpler” version. Moreover, my strong suit is math and stats, not programming. In fact, we have another researcher who’s speciality is programming and we were all a but confused as to why he wasn’t asked to do this! I barely know any python (our preferred language), definitely not enough to design an entire simulation, and I made that clear when I was brought on. And I even brought this problem up this week at our research meeting, that I wasnt able to create a simulation because I have absolutely no idea where to even start. I was given some pointers but those weren’t helpful at all. And now I have to go in this coming week and tell my team, once again, that I was unable to create a simulation because im so lost. Our research advisor was supposed to send me material that would help last week but he forgot, and he forgot to do it again this week. So I can’t help but feel like I’ve been given an unfair amount of work to do on my own. The expected workload for this project is supposed to be 5 hrs per week, but I’ve already spent so many more hours learning numerical methods on python, and am expected to spend a whole lot more to create this simulation? That doesn’t sound right at all and I’ve already embarrassed myself enough when I couldn’t produce anything. At this point, I’m probably just gonna call in sick to avoid the embarrassment again. Am I in the wrong here? Is research actually this much work, even if it was literally in our contract that it’d only be 5-7 hrs per week? Because my previous research experiences definitely weren’t like this. Its making me want to walk away from this- which I know is a terrible thing to do mid-project.

"Letter about NIH 15% cap. Hi all, I wrote a letter to my representatives today regarding the NIH cap. I'm putting it here too and wanted to encourage you to send something similar to your reps! And, you can find who your local officials are here: [https://www.usa.gov/elected-officials](https://www.usa.gov/elected-officials) Please repost in relevant reddit threads, and if anyone has made something similar for other policies impacting researchers right now, please also add those here! (I also posted this in a few other reddits) EDIT: Folks are right that you should call as well! This is a very helpful tool going around social media for making calls: [https://5calls.org/](https://5calls.org/) Dear Congressman, I hope this letter finds you well, and I would like to express my deep concern about the recently proposed budget cuts to overhead fees for the National Institutes of Health (NIH; https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-25-068.html). This would have major impacts on research in the United States, such as the research of health and diseases that affect many people – including your constituents. I am troubled by comments suggesting that indirect costs are unnecessary or unimportant. First and foremost, the majority of indirect fee percentages are not even set by the NIH; rather, they are most often established by the HHS Division of Cost Allocation or the Department of Defense’s Office of Naval Research (https://www.niaid.nih.gov/grants-contracts/know-basics-facilities-and-administrative-costs). Thus, attempting to gut the NIH budget rather than reforming the way that other departments calculate overhead fees is simply misguided. Further, it is important to recognize that while these fees can be high, they cover quite a lot. Other than simple administrative costs, they aid in chemical waste management, proper storage of animals and chemicals, maintenance fees for machines, electricity, water, and janitorial fees. Additionally, indirect costs allow for administrative assistance in submitting NIH grants – this is a complicated process that can and should be reformed, however, I am concerned that there has been no discussion of reforming federal grant submissions. I am greatly disturbed by the potential implications of these policies. While the United States is currently a world leader in scientific innovation and research, many laboratories would be forced to close their doors under these policies, and I foresee the US quickly losing its status as a top tier country for research. These budgetary cuts also make little financial sense, as every $1 used for NIH-funded research is more than doubled in return at $2.46 (https://www.fiercebiotech.com/research/report-every-dollar-nih-research-funding-doubles-economic-returns). Most academic institutions will not use their endowments – if they have them (many state universities do not have large endowments) – to cover these losses and aid a department that is not making them any money. Further, NIH policies do not allow for researchers to use funding for direct costs for indirect costs, leaving researchers at a stand-still. I would also like to provide you with a more personal story of how this will impact your constituents, such as myself, and academic research. (add personal story here if you want) These changes will force a lot of progress to be lost and will impact everyone, especially those in rural areas who have less access to medical care. I sincerely hope that you can take action on this pressing issue, advocate for this funding to not be cut, and work to ensure that our tax dollars are used in a way that enables important scientific research to continue and thrive – allowing the US to remain number one in innovation and discovery.

These include: - intercollegiate athletic fee (all games / practices are cancelled) - student media fee (the school newspaper hasn’t published anything in ten days) - student success fee (all tutoring appears to be cancelled) - music / theater fee (obviously cancelled too) - transit fee (the busses are operating on only one of three lines, and it’s a reduced schedule) - consolidated student services fee, which is the biggest. While this includes student health, which is still operating, it also appears to pay for our rec center and other facilities that are closed. Have a look at your billing statement. Are you paying for things you no longer have access to? Has your school said anything about refunds? I’m considering contacting financial services here and asking for some of this money back.

"Accepted to two different PhD programs. at the same school. Need advice, please. Hello! After many, many rejections, I am very blessed to have been accepted into two programs at a university that I consider to be very of-quality (Case Western Reserve University), but Im not sure which to accept due to some odd circumstances surrounding the two. One is an Applied Mathematics PhD program, and the other is a Computer Engineering PhD program. Now I know the answer to this is ""We don't know where your interests lie, pal. That's ultimately a decision you need to make on your own."" However, I would like input on the odd circumstances I alluded to above. Also, I would like input on a few other topics as well that Ill get into here in a bit. Ill try and keep it as brief as possible. For the Applied Math PhD program, I got my acceptance (after being put on the waitlist initially) yesterday. They want me to make a decision by tomorrow. The Computer Engineering PhD program accepted me outright - also need to make a decision on that program by tomorrow as well, I assume. However, for the CE program, I have to seek funding on my own. AKA, I have to speak with professors and *hope* that one of the professors whose research interests align with mine have an open RA position that I am able to fill. Seems a bit weird to me, right? I dont want to accept the CE offer just to not find a position and be forced to pay the entirely-too-expensive tuition and boarding fees. What would you all do? I have to make this decision pretty darn quickly so. time isn't really of the essence, unfortunately. Another issue, is that there are some other programs that I have applied for that have not yet got back with me. If I accept one of these two offers that I've already received and a new programs accepts me down the line, and I want to be a part of the new program instead, I dont have much issue rescinding my acceptance (although, emotionally, I would feel pretty bad doing so). I just want to know if it is possible. I dont want to shackle myself to a program that Im less interested in simply because I would feel bad leaving it after accepting their offer earlier in the year. Would it be a bad move to accept the program now, and then if a better offer comes my way to accept that one, even if I do so after April 15th? And finally - a more general question. Would an Applied Math PhD or a Computer Engineering PhD be more beneficial to me job-wise in the future, specifically relating to careers not in academia? Is one dominant over the other, or are the differences pretty negligible? As a note - my bachelors is in Math/Computer Science so I have an education background in both Mathematics and CPS. Also, as a final question, do the programs themselves generally differ from one another in any key ways that I should know about before going in?

"&gt; Military service is essentially a loan, just a loan of your time/life instead of money. This is only true if you choose to take the most dramatically negative perspective of the actual situation. &gt; You owe the U.S. army 4 years of active service &amp; another 4 years afterwards during which you’re required to drop everything and fight if they need you. During your active duty period you will also receive training to perform some kind of a useful job. You will also be paid, and provided with access to a retirement savings program. You will be provided with extensive medical care (of admittedly varying quality) to address any significant issues you might have. You may be provided opportunities to see more of the world than you otherwise might experience. Then once you exit active duty you are provided with a very nice handful of significant veteran's benefits: * Vocational training. * The GI Bill (4 years of free college) * Veteran's Home Loan assistance * Free lunch and dinner every year for the rest of your life on veteran's day and memorial day. * 10% discounts (or more) at retail stores all over the country. * Preferential employment status with most US employers (though this may be considered a DEI initiative) &gt; this will actually mean risking your life. Is there risk? Yes. There is risk. The level of risk may not be acceptable to everyone, and that is a personal decision to make. If you agree to an Infantry contract or Tanks or Anti-Aircraft Rockets these job-roles all involve quite a bit of risk. But if you negotiate a Payroll &amp; Finance clerk contract, or an HVAC Facilities Maintenance contract, or Satellite Communications contract, while none of these are a zero-risk job role within the military, they are all dramatically less risk than other job roles. Yes: It is possible that a Payroll Clerk on an Air Force Base in Texas can die in a freak accident when a bomb falls off a truck or something. But it is similarly possible that a student at a random university can be run over by a donut delivery truck on their way to class. It is also similarly possible that a student can complete their $180,000 undergraduate degree in psychology and after failing to access meaningful employment choose a path of self-harm under pressure from student loans. Human Life includes some level of risk. Those risks can be evaluated and discussed to help an individual make informed decisions",Placement & Career Services,Medium,1.0,web:pullpush:r/ApplyingToCollege:comment:issue,Medium,1,2428,419,17,"&gt; Military service is essentially a loan, just a loan of your time/life instead of money.",0

"should I drop out? 6 weeks left in a 1 year course but I'm kinda miserable. basically, I'm just over 6 weeks away from finishing a pre-college one year course. I like the content but because one of the main instructors was absent for the first 6 weeks of the course we are moving through projects and assignments really quickly. I was stressed about it but doing ok-ish until I got sick for 3 weeks in January and even with extensions it seems likely I'll just fail a couple of my modules because my work is handed in so late it wont be graded. Not going to get into my mental health much here because of the post rules - but it's been pretty bad since this course started. I think I may have depression or something at the moment but I'm slow to throw labels at things. I'm seeing a therapist but the sheer amount of work that I know I just dont have the time to catch up on, and the sense of like shame that I can't do this course as well as I thought is messing with me. I've always been good academically and at the start of the year I was one of the better students in many of the modules, but that is no longer the case and they all seem vaguelly like disappointed? when I tell them I'm planning on doing Arts next year instead of this course they all look at me like I've failed or something. I've been fairly stable mental health wise for the past 4 or 5 years so this is quite unusual for me The way this course is structured (3 2/3 hour long classes with one half hour gap in the day, only about 13 people in the course and a small campus so no social stuff at all really) doesn't suit me at all. I have pretty significant Adhd and even on meds I've really struggled with the structure of this course. We get loads of work to do at home also and it's so hard for me to get anything done at my desk after coming home at the end of the day. The college library also has really limited hours so I can't even work there really. Its also all assignment based rather than exam based and its taken me longer than others to get used to that because of my Adhd. I also have to do 40 hours work experience between now and the course finishing, so I'm looking at a very heavy 6 weeks ahead with that also (8 hours a week work experience on top of 26 hours in college and then more hours working from home as well as that). It also seems like because of how burnt out I am that I won't be able to do the work experience projects as well as I'd like, and I'm worried that will damage my relationship/reputation with the person I'm doing work experience with, I really don't want her to see me as unreliable. I did quite well in my exams in secondary school and will for sure get a spot in the Arts course in my local university for September based on those grades, so I dont need to do well in or even pass this course to get in. I'm fairly confident that the arts course will suit me more, it's more interesting to me content wise, there are more essays (which I really enjoy writing, my current course has almost none) and less contact hours with more gaps in the day, and a bigger campus so I can have more of a social life (a few of my friends study there also). The pure amount of hours this course takes for me to do means I have way less/no time to do things I care about (make art, write, see my friends, have a part-time job, my youth theatre group). The course was also not that expensive fees-wise, so it's not been a massive financial investment So yeah idk if that made any sense. Basically do I pull though 6 weeks of unnecessary slog that is stressing me out to the point of loosing my will to live, but get to put a solidly useful qualification on my CV and have my parents not be disapointed in me. Or do I drop out, fuck around with a part time job and focus on my creative hobbies before going into college in September as a fresh start (and if I'm still not right then I'll go up on my adhd meds I'd say)",Attendance,Medium,1.0,web:pullpush:r/college:submission:fee,Medium,1,3921,774,2,should I drop out?,0

Hello fellow professors, I've noticed recently that students sitting in the back rows of my classroom are having trouble seeing my projected slides clearly. I want to make sure all my students have equal access to the material, but I'm unsure of the best approach. Some solutions I've been considering: -Sharing slides before/after class (though I've been reluctant to do this) -Using larger fonts and higher contrast -Encouraging back-row students to move forward -Verbally describing visual elements as I present -Creating handouts for complex visual content -Recording lectures with clear views of slides For those of you who've dealt with this issue before, what worked well? Did sharing slides beforehand affect attendance or engagement? Any creative solutions I haven't thought of? I teach in a traditional classroom with 30-40 students.

"I feel like I’m going to fail my algebra class no matter what I do. Back story: mental health issues my entire life. I was taken out of school during 6th grade to be “homeschooled” which never happened. Finally at 30, I decided to change my life for the better and I got my hiset. I have never been strong at math and I have dyscalculia which makes it even harder. I barely passed the math portion of my hiset exam. Somehow I got placed into intermediate algebra when I did my placement test upon entry to a CC. Current situation: in intermediate algebra and my professor is just awful. This is not just me talking either, a few other people in class that I’ve connected to also dislike her and one even says she’s the devil. She’s just a bad teacher. She goes extremely fast, doesn’t finish line of thought, doesn’t finish problems. She does them halfway and says “okay you get it, let’s move on”. I didn’t get it, I don’t understand. But if you say something or speak up, she shames you. I literally have a list of things she’s said and done that I will be turning into the school at the end of this semester. I don’t want it to come back on me at this point because I HAVE to pass this class. I have asked for help, I’ve emailed about specific homework problems I had trouble with. One in particular was a graphing problem and I sent it to her explaining I didn’t understand where I was going wrong and how to fix it. She just emailed back “your lines are wrong”. I obviously knew that since I got the problem wrong. Gave me no advice on how to fix it. The next class, a few of us were talking about that specific problem and she heard us and just said “the computer is finicky”. (It’s on my math lab)One girl even said she couldn’t finish it because everything she tried didn’t work and the professor just shrugged. At least 4 of us all said we struggled with that and she literally just shrugged. The school does have a tutor that I have seen, but he isn’t a teacher. He can help me with specific problems but that’s it. I’m literally basically teaching myself and I don’t know what to do. I watch khan academy videos, I ask AI, but I’m struggling.

"Complaint and legal discrimination. am a single mother with terrible ADHD, autism, PTSD, and multiple anxiety disorders. I'm currently in college and I came across a bad professor. I've been told he's very old and I'm assuming he's tenured. The low level math class should be easy but it's terrible and the prof isn't right. This started with a complaint (with evidence) and an investigation involving unfair grading and his syllabus. His syllabus is consistently wrong about dates/times of tests, it is unclear, and he lied to me and told me to disregard to syllabus when he shouldn't of. The material he gives us to study doesn't match up with a good portion of what is on the test. He gets a lot of documented complaints. It now has a disability twist! My accommodations declare I get extra time on tests which I haven't received. I assumed that I needed to call up there and talk to student services, and because of the nature of my disability and the stress this class has caused me, I didn't have the bandwidth. Apparently, the letter was sent out but was ignored by my professor even after I told him that I had a learning disability and didn't receive accommodations this semester. Would I be wrong to assume because of this and the fact he lied about the syllabus, that this is a terrible case of harassment and discrimination? The syllabus lie that he told me was that I needed to study two weeks of material in one week for our weekly test. Should I speak to a lawyer? What should I expect?

"Too nice? too mean. Hello! I was hoping I might get some feedback on my approach to emailing two different professors, in two different contexts, with two different intentions. Let me explain: 1. Too nice? I am currently taking one class that I am (unexpectedly) **really** enjoying. Moreover, in the context of remote content delivery, and in contrast to my other classes, this professor and TA have BY FAR the most dynamic assignments, the clearest online formatting (through the university website), and *transparency about their expectations!* In addition, they are also just super nice, passionate about the topic, and compassionate to students who are struggling. I have never felt inclined to do so before (during the course), but I want to express my gratitude and appreciation to my professors in an email — but is this *too nice?* I don't want to come off as a ""teacher's pet"" who is doing it cynically to boost their grade, but I also really, genuinely, want to thank them (I would guess based on the class averages for graded material that I am in the top percentile of students, for whatever it's worth). Even if I was receiving mediocre/average grades, I think I would still want to express my appreciation for the formatting alone! The content of my email wouldn't be *too* effusive but it would at least commend the pair for the most of what I've said above. Do I *mention* that I'm not trying to affect my grade? Does that make it worse? Help! 2. Too mean? I am also taking a course which is the exact polar opposite of the first one. The professor is very opaque in every respect: her assignments carry with them absolutely no guidelines beyond a single sentence describing the assignment, there is no clear expression of how we're being graded beyond the standard university letter-GPA conversion chart, and the course page is messy and confusing. Listen, I would never expect folks who are unfamiliar with an online format to produce one like I've seen in the first question in the *best of times* — but omg! Much more importantly though, this professor is RUDE! Some may call it ""challenging"" or even ""demanding"" but it feels malicious; during one session, the professor made a student tear up after berating them for how disappointed she was in the student for not meeting the expectations of the course! After setting no expectations! Very inappropriate to do, even less so when the rest of the class sat in stunned silence on zoom. To this professor, my email will be admittedly self-interested — but I have no idea how I'm doing in the course! She's incredibly hard to read, has not handed a single assignment back, and as I said, does not explain how she'll be grading us, barely setting the parametres of her own assignments! If I had to guess, I'd say I'm about C+ to B+? Who knows! Sorry for the rant, here's the problem: we have a couple major assignments coming up. During our very first seminar a student asked if she would offer a grading rubric and she said she would; we're about half way through the term and I haven't received it nor has it been posted nor discussed by anyone ever again! Second, during one seminar I asked if I could see a past assignment as an example of what she expects (this is an entitlement for students under our university policy). She said she would try, but that I might not receive it before the due date. Totally understandable. I was negligent and I asked late. But I still have not gotten anything. I want to ask how I'm doing so far. I want to know what she expects from me. I want to bring up the examples where she said she would provide clear examples of her expectations but has not done so! But also — it's almost midway through the term and I haven't contacted her directly yet. I don't want her to think I'm a bad student for not having established these things sooner. I don't want her to be prejudiced against my final assignments because I was too assertive or rude in the email. More than anything, I just really want to do well in the course because I really, really, really, love the topic. I'm so passionate about it. I want to be able to reflect that! HELP! \--- EDIT: I thought of another problem of mine lol. I get the feeling that I may not be doing well in the ""participation"" metric of a few different courses. I've always dealt with anxiety (maybe you could already tell?) but in-person, I was able to get by. Especially when class discussions would devolve into smaller, more intimate groups. But now I feel even *more* self-conscious participating. When you speak on zoom, in many of my classes, your face takes over the entire screen. It feels like so much extra pressure. Should I — and I get the feeling I should — email my professors about this? I'm trying to get over it and become more confident in participating, but it's difficult",Academic,Medium,1.0,web:pullpush:r/AskProfessors:submission:professor rude,Medium,1,4831,862,0,Too nice?,0
"should i transfer? shift? or stay. This would be a long post so please bear with me. I just really feel lost rn. Do i pursue medbio in this university where I'm planning to transfer, or shift to psych in my current uni, or just stay in my current course (bio) in my current uni? A little bit of a background: bio has always been my first choice, it's my current course but I've lost my passion for it. I wanted to pursue med but due to personal reasons and my continuously deteriorating mental health, I'm starting to think that it isn't for me. Psychology has always been my 2nd choice, but rn I became more interested in it and I already got future plans after graduating. Also, I think career choices in bio after grad are more limited (well, in our country) if I won't be going to medschool. I also applied for psych in the uni where I'm planning to transfer but I've been informed that it's already closed so i opted for medbio. I also live in a toxic household (I live in the province) and ever since 2019, I've always wanted to move out, go to the metro and live the college life of my dreams. I'm also in a long distance relationship. They're from the metro and my attachment style rn is not secured. I have so many what ifs and worries. Lastly, I'm a scholar and I have to consider financial stuff since there's a chance that my stipend will be put on hold for a year if i push through my transferring or shifting.

I'm kinda overwhelmed thinking about the back and forth stuff bet my current uni and the uni (in the metro) for the documents, the crediting of subjects + docs for my scholarship. If I'll stay here in the province, I'll still be staying in a dorm so there's still some freedom I guess? So what do I do? • pursue medbio in the metro? (college life of my dreams. I'm with my s/o, so less fighting. New environment. There's freedom. I'll be more independent. BUT financially, will I survive? For a year? Classes have started already, transferring process is already so stressful + the course :(( ) • pursue psych in my current uni (yay love the course! Province :( there's freedom but? maybe 20-30km away from home? no s/o, still ldr. stipend will be put on hold) • don't shift/transfer. stay on your course rn. (No motivation but at least stipend won't be put on hold. No more delays. Not that stressful rn, no worries about documents and stuff. No s/o, still ldr) Thanks for reading until the end.

"Getting Old Classes Removed. Hello r/college, I have a couple questions. Just FYI my background is longish to give context for the questions. I’m currently a senior in university. I’ve changed my majors twice from chem eng &gt; comp sci &gt; industrial management. I currently love my major, but I’m suffering from fees from the college for having more than 120 hours. Every semester from here on out I have to pay an extra 600 dollars. I don’t make good money, I’m part time cashier, and I don’t qualify for financial aid (1.94). Since I’ve come to my new degree, I have nothing all As and Bs with the exception of one C. *First question would be* Is there any way to get those grades off my transcript? I never want to touch those majors again, and have some Ds really affecting my gpa that could help me with financial issues. I’ve heard from friends who attend bigger named colleges like A&amp;M, that they offer a forgiveness program but it’s a one time thing for a semester, surely there has to be other options right? *Background for second question* I suffer from being extremely depression/anxious/suicidal and am being helped by the Disability Research Center on campus. I’ve had my disability since late 2015, and I am currently doing better. It’s caused me to retake countless courses in the past, fail numerous times, and drop plenty of courses. This semester I had to retake a class from my freshmen year which was CHEM 1311. Immediately I had a hard time having taking it in Summer Session 1. Our first hw, exam, and official grade was given after the drop date to get my money back for the class, so I was “forced” to continue the class. On top of working part time, and taking another course, this professor made me very anxious (something I hadn’t felt in a long time). After the first exam he basically said if we were still here after the first exam having made a bad grade we had a 90% chance of failure. WHO SAYS THAT. Mind you this is a 5 week course, so on top of all this anxiety we had a bad storm hit campus and damage all the computers on campus that had a program that I needed for my second class so I started to fall behind in both. I needed an A in this class since it was a major course, so I decided to focus on the course and just pay for the CHEM class not finishing it. I barely made a C in the class, because on top of falling behind due to the storm, that SAME week, my grandfather was in hospice and on his death bed. Who wouldn’t make time to see their dying grandpa? So there was no way I could take the CHEM course with all the stress and stuff I had been dealing with. *Second question* Is there anyway to get this F removed from my transcript? I originally had a D in the course, but the registrar notified me that it takes the most recent grade no matter what (something they failed to mention). I don’t care about the money at this point, I just want to be able to get my GPA above a 2.0 so I can save up money for my last 5 classes since I only qualify for 4 more classes of financial aid (Which bounces off my first question of possibly getting my old classes removed if I could, I don’t think I’ll be using Thermodynamics in the manufacturing business). I could really use some help, I’ve talked to Financial Aid and the Registrar and just keep bouncing around my questions and giving me short responses (they are terrible people no matter how much bs I know they deal with, we’re all human I just want to be treated like I matter). And as of right now the DRC hasn’t answered me back being busy with Summer Session 2 students so I’m probably not priority. I just want to know my rights because at this point I don’t think I can afford my next payment which is in 2 weeks, or even my fall classes that I’m registered for",Academic,Medium,1.0,web:reddit:r/college:search:fee issue,Medium,1,3770,712,0,Getting Old Classes Removed.,0

"Getting into your top school won't guarantee happiness. I got into my top school REA, and it felt like a dream. I kept refreshing the page and checking so often because I legitimately couldn't believe it. For a week, it felt like the happiness wouldn't wear off. But, then it did. I'm constantly worrying right now about the same things I used to. Some part of me had assumed that getting into a great college would be enough of a self-esteem boost to help other aspects of my life. But, the same anxiety and self-doubt still stay. It may manifest differently, thinking my acceptance was a fluke or that since I'm from a small-city public school I can't match the private school kids later in college. I find myself being hit even harder by senioritis. And the worst thing is that I feel so guilty about being sad. I should be happy; after all, my high school work paid off. But, the anxiety I developed on the way isn't going away. This isn't much of a complaint or a seek for help. I've had a great high school life and have had both a social and academic life. I've dated, hung out with friends, hiked and explored, and done other high school kid stuff. But, the stress with this entire, impending process has changed me and the way I think. I can't do anything without finding flaws in myself to pick out. I don't know what's next anymore. My entire high school life I had college as the highest academic goal, and now I'm just faced with uncertainty and my own deficiencies catching up to me. Three summers ago, a person in one of my extracurricular's community took his life. I didn't know him very well or at all really, and I heard people saying that they didn't get it. He was set to go to a T5 school, but that didn't change that he had been struggling with his mental health for a while. All I really want to say though is that don't think everything will be better once you get into college. The academic system in America will make us value higher education to the extent that we conflate personal fulfillment with an acceptance letter. Our emotions still matter, and our lives will still continue. Although I come from a place of privilege when talking about getting into your dream school, I just think it's important to understand that your life will change but it doesn't mean all your problems will go away.

Are there any grants that cover past semester bills. So I started school at Lehman in 2020 fall. I got the excelsior scholarship I was good. 2022 spring I was notified half way through the semester. Not even. I found out my self that I lost the excelsior scholarship because i was missing 1 credit from the 2021 school year. By the end of 2022 I would have have 63 credits. Over the the amount of credits needed and still on my way to complete my degree. I tried to appeal they said no. Whole ordeal. So now I owe 10k because of loss of scholarship. The next two years are now torture for me mentally and physically many factors. Leads to Depression. Identity stolen(ex stole messed). Family issue etc etc etc. I transferred to a community college. Taking small classes here or there paying my tuition. Took time off I think I found my passion I could get into the program I want to pursue dental hygiene. So now I transfer to Hostos community college. I can’t attend until that 10k bill is dispersed because cuny bills are all tied into 1 basically. I now here I am.

Food is (apparently) mediocre * **Competitive**, exclusive club culture and could bleed into the student body * Also, I heard there are curves at McDonough, conrtibuting to this competitive culture. I don't know if this is a valid concern but it's something that stuck with me. * Overall I am **unsure of what student life/culture is like**.

I'm concerned about connecting with others and having a good social life, and I know I'll have it at Dartmouth but I'm not sure about GU (which I feel sounds trivial. but yeah.) **Dartmouth** Pros: * **Flexible** with courses and thru D-Plan, will allow me to explore what I like if I end up changing my mind on business * Apparently (not too sure a friend of mine said this) very **strong for consulting** despite not having a business undergrad * I visited their fly-in, Dartmouth Bound, and really appreciated the **tight-knit community** and felt like I was sure to be supported throughout my four years * Generally nice and collaborative students based off my visit, felt very welcoming and seen * **Dorms are okay**, I have no complaints really, **food was great** though and set the standard for my expectations * Ivy league lol * **Grade inflation**? Not too sure * I think GU is still sort of personable as it's not too big but Dartmouth seems like it guarantees the personable college classes and experience Cons: * Although **Hanover** is beautiful it is small and I don't know how I would like it for four years, my current town is already sort of small and I wanted to branch out for college + it is nature-oriented (which I don't not enjoy but I am not a heavy nature person.) * If I wanted to go to the city I'd have to go to Boston, which doesn't seem like it would be an often occurrence * **Greek life** is prevalent as opposed to GU's lack of Greek life, I don't know if I would like it Overall I really enjoyed my three days at Dartmouth, and it stuck with me ever since, but I feel as if it's unfair to compare as I never got to experience Georgetown IRL and there are a lot of aspects that attract me towards Georgetown.

It happens. My tips for a happy home: * Things will get tense, its inevitable, you will fight. Pick and choose your battles and decide which hills are worth dying on. You will quickly find that its better to keep the peace than to complain for the 12th time for your roommate to clean up their dishes. * Always be courteous and let your roommates know when a guest is coming over or if you plan on having a party. Don't blast your music at all hours and if you have to get up early, be quiet and leave quickly. * Do your chores and clean up after yourself, but don't expect others to do the same. **Expectation is the mother of disappointment.** * Pay for your portion of the bills on time. Sounds simple, you would be surprised at how hard it is for some people to respect deadlines, even friends. * Pay for your own food, avoid communal eating. There is always one person who eats more and accommodating everyones personal tastes and dietary needs in this day and age is a nightmare. Go in on bulk items like ketchup but leave the rest for yourself. * Don't eat other peoples food, and if you do replace it and then some",Hostel,High,2.0,web:pullpush:r/college:comment:portal not working,High,2,2416,427,9,Living in an apartment is a bit different from living in a dorm.,0

"A positive experience teaching racial ideologies and stereotyping this week (!). I'm as frightened and horrified as many of you are here about the state of. everything. But perhaps this is a glimmer of hope? I say this as an immigrant here on a conditional green card in an NTT position. I'm also a petite, young looking White woman.

And I have. This week, I taught 2 separate lessons on racism and stereotyping in sport to about 140 students (big-name Black football players, small town White kids, Asian-American students, and many first-gen Hispanic students). We talked about Jack Johnson and the racial prejudice he faced in 1908. We talked about racist caricatures of Serena Williams from 2018. We talked about Jeremy Lin speaking out against Asian hatred post-COVID. We watched a clip from Coach Carter and talked about barriers to access and their relationship to racial inequity. Students talked in small groups, related these stories to their own lives (I was overhearing things like ""you know, someone also made a racist comment to me on the basketball court once, so I get this""), spoke up in the big lecture hall to share why they were troubled by racial stereotyping in college football recruiting, and above all, they LISTENED. Like, they actually listened. To me and to each other. My TA thanked me after class today. I almost cried with relief when the last class was over today.

"Can someone take a look at my appeal for academic suspension. I just want to know if it is too long or if I should change/add something. Everything I say below is genuine and I truly do think I can do better next semester: To the Satisfactory Academic Appeal Committee: My name is (x) and I am a freshman in (major). After the Spring 2024 semester, I was informed of my academic suspension from (x). I understand that my academic performance has been less than adequate and take full responsibility for my shortcomings. I write this hoping to convey how important continuing my education at (x) is. With careful reflection on my mistakes, I created a plan to ensure academic success. I have used the last couple of weeks to think about where I went wrong in both my past semesters at (x). Although I did improve drastically from my first to this past semester, my final grade did not meet the required 2.0 cumulative GPA. Between fall semester and spring semester, I planned and applied changes in my learning that enabled me to succeed in the classes. Some of these changes included: implementing a flexible schedule in which I used to allocate my time primarily into studying for at least 2 hours a day when I had the time to, having a better daily routine in which I became more focused during lectures and discussions, creating practice tests on my own to test my understanding of the material consistently for test preparation and to stay on track, increased hours of sleep and more. I have also changed my methods of studying to achieve better results in comparison to fall semester. For example, I stopped spontaneously planning my studying and organized what I needed to get done in addition to planning ahead, which I can attribute to the helpfulness of the STS Success Coach from the Mentor Advising Connection (MAC) program I have also scheduled weekly online tutoring for most of my classes. A problem with one of my methods, however, was writing notes in a notebook for every lecture. There are times where I still did not understand the material due to the rapid speed of the professor and had to figure out another way to retain the information. The part that I failed was I still could have found more ways to understand the material, such as communicating with professors during office hours instead of through email. As a result of the changes I implemented in terms of studying, I stayed on track with assignments and consistently was able to receive high grades for them through most of the spring semester. In addition, I have achieved a 94 on my first midterm for ECON 162 which I was very proud of because it showed the major improvement I made compared to fall semester. In fact I had done so well consistently in my classes that my academic advisor, (x), did not think that it was necessary for me to schedule a meeting with him once a month in accordance with the contract. The first problem came with the second midterm of CQS 112. The professor had not prepared us well for the midterm in which the entire class submitted a petition for a final curve. This had devastated me as I had prepared as much as I could with the resources I had. I also had major issues when it came to writing essays for WRIT 111 especially during the latter half of the semester. I found writing about the topics extremely difficult. Instead of going to office hours and seeking help with them, I racked my brain for hours and accomplished very little, adding onto frustration. That was my biggest problem academically this semester. The biggest blunder that I made was during finals. I quickly became anxious. My mental state quickly deteriorated, and I could not study with the same confidence that I had. This was an issue for the fall semester as well. For context purposes, I would like to explain my mental struggles during Fall 2023 and Spring 2024. This is by no means an attempt to excuse myself from my shortcomings but rather an attempt to give a more holistic perspective as well as a plan that I will discuss later on how I could deal with these situations. As a freshman in the fall of 2023, I entered school positive and determined to make myself and parents proud. What I did not realize at that time however was that I was not accustomed to the pace of college coursework. During the fall semester, I found it difficult to balance my scholastic responsibilities with other goals I had, and did not adjust well to college life. For one, I had to withdraw from my math course due to the overwhelming difficulty and lack of understanding previous material. I chose to switch over to MATH 108 and was kept on a waitlist until the end of the add/drop period was over, but with the help and guidance of academic advising, I was able to enroll in ACCT 211. However, since I came into the class so late with no knowledge, I had to spend the entire semester catching up due to the difficulty of the course. In addition, I have not taken into consideration my needs to destress, and it quickly deteriorated my mental health over the semester, to the point where I worried everybody around me. For many years I have battled depression, and the stress of not being able to adjust led to lack of sleep and loss of appetite, which affected my academic performance. I was scared of talking to professionals due to reasons of the past, and did not think of meeting with a therapist. The build-up of stress led to me frantically trying to catch up on everything, with finals week continuously setting up all-nighters. Over winter break, I reassessed myself and developed a plan to succeed academically for the spring semester. The results were very promising and I have gone through with my desire to continue staying in (x) University. I have made results which if continued through for the rest of my academic career would yield me positive results. However I could not prepare well enough with the stress of finals and I slowly started falling apart. To ensure my success if given the opportunity to return this semester, I have created a plan. It involves increased mandatory communication with my academic advisor as well as extending it for the whole year so that I can understand the standing that I am throughout the semesters and understand any additional resources I could utilize. I will implement mandatory office hours with all of my professors to my schedule for myself and extend my time on schoolwork as well as provide enough room for methods of destressing. I will also continue to use the MAC program to figure out how to succeed for midterms and finals, the points I struggled with the most. In terms of mental health, I have started to understand the importance of therapy and counseling and will schedule sessions to figure out a plan to combat my instabilities for my personal growth as well as academic growth, especially during the latter half of the semester. To better achieve a balance between my family responsibilities and my academic ones I have planned out how I could involve myself as efficiently as possible with family matters when I come back during breaks to minimize its interference during my time on campus. I am planning to become more involved with extracurriculars as well. I have attended multiple seminars for the Management Consulting Group over the spring semester and will continue to do so with the hope of applying for a position. I will attend Goldman Sachs' 2024 Emerging Leaders Series over winter break as well as other similar opportunities to expand my networking and professional experience. I realize that my goals in the past have been very general, but this semester I have very concrete goals, if a bit unrealistic, goals. First, I strive to commit to getting top-notch grades consistently and particularly for finals. Second, I strive to become more involved on campus through club involvement and professional events throughout the semester as well as attending career fairs and gaining exposure to networking opportunities. In addition, I have made close friends who wish to see me excel for future semesters by continuously looking out for me and helping me with studying. I understand that my GPA is not enough for me to continue at (major) as they require a minimum of 3.2 and I will meet with (x) Advising as well as Major Advisor to help determine a plan for transitioning into a major that is suited for me. I know that I can succeed at (x) and contribute to it as well. From challenges in the past, I continuously grew and continuously strive to improve. I would greatly appreciate another chance to demonstrate what I can do. The spring semester has really served to rekindle my motivation and drive and knowing that I could definitely excel at the pace I was going with the new discipline I had. I hope you will allow me to bring my enthusiasm and drive to thrive at (x) University. I would greatly appreciate a chance to speak in person if it is possible.

"I need advice. My entire college process has been so difficult and it has been hard on me and my parents. When I was a senior in high school I applied to a bunch of schools and my entire plan was to go to a school in Florida, and so I ended up enrolling to St. Thomas University but they ran out of housing so I ended up having to switch however, that was the only Florida school I got into so I enrolled to Ferris State University Because it was close to home But St. Thomas University wouldn’t give me my enrollment feedback or the deposit money so we wasted $300. Then I ended up getting into Penn State and my parents wanted me to un enroll from Ferris State University and enroll into Penn State because it was a really good school. So I did and we got the enrollment fee and deposit money back from Ferris State University. I got my enrollment fee and deposit completely covered by Penn State. I was so excited and I was so determined to go, but then I got my financial aid and I was going to get $0. Nothing. Zip. Zero. And I come from a really poor family and my parents forced me to unenroll because they didn’t want me getting loans for it however I was okay with the loans, but I did what they said because I wanted their support. And so because this was also last minute of me having to unenroll from Penn State I decided to enroll in my “local” college, Trine University. I went there early, doing a summer bridge program and met one of my roommates there who I hated she stole and invited guys over all the time and all in all she was just an awful roommate, but other than that, I was having a pretty good time. I felt very independent and free. I went for elementary education and kept getting pressure from my parents to do something else because teachers don’t make that much money. So I switched my major to criminal justice and I wanted to be a crime scene investigator or a detective. However, if you do that you have to be a cop for about minimum 10 years and I refuse to be a cop. This college was super expensive and because of my roommate issues and my parents pressure I decided to switch online and it was way cheaper and it was OK for about two weeks but I hated being stuck at home 24 seven and it was harder because I didn’t have teachers helping me because I am more of a hands-on learner. I ended up dropping out two weeks in the second semester. I was planning on transferring, but my parents kept getting mad and so I dropped out and enrolled into cosmetology school, which I start in March because in high school I always wanted to do cosmetology, but I still want to go to college and kind of want to back out of cosmetology because the deposit alone is $1050 and my mom said that she’s gonna be short on her car payment because of her paying for that so I feel really bad and my mom keeps yelling at me that I have to do something because she doesn’t want me sitting around the house and I kind of want to just instead go to a college and start summer semester but I don’t know how to tell anybody that and I haven’t paid any money or anything for cosmetology school. I just toured the school so I don’t have anything financial or any obligations to that. but I don’t know how to tell my parents because I know that they will be really mad. They’re just gonna yell at me and be like why did you drop out if this entire time you still wanted to go to college and finding a major has been a struggle for me and just everything it’s a lot of stress. I don’t know how I’m supposed to know what I wanna do for the rest of my life at only 18. I want to go to a college further away either in Florida, California, Oklahoma, Alabama, Kentucky, or North Carolina. I am still deciding on what major because I think no matter what major I do, I will not get my parents support because they have never supported my decision in going to college because it is a lot of money and I think I just need to get it over with and start my life. Should I just tell my parents I’m not doing cosmetology school? I will tell them I am still figuring out my education and I won’t be “sitting around the house” cause I have work until I do start school at some point but I’m just nervous Now I also need help figuring out what major to do Elementary or Secondary Education - I have grown up always wanting to be a teacher since I was like seven, but they don’t make a lot of money. If I do elementary education, I would want to be a kindergarten or second grade teacher, and if I do secondary education, then I want to be a literature teacher (hopefully for seniors) Communications - this is what I was originally going to switch my major to after criminal justice but I knew my parents wouldn’t support it and I knew that the rest of my family wouldn’t understand, but I have a few ideas for what I would do with this degree. I definitely plan to do social media related things in the future with my life, no matter what major I do, but I feel like this would also help and then I also want to work for the NFL as either a social media manager or marketing manager or photographer, religious anything for the NFL I love football. I grew up watching it and I think this would just be really fun and I’m really passionate about this and I feel like I would have the best time doing this however, working for the NFL is not a guaranteed job but communications is such a wide variety that even if I didn’t get a job working for the NFL that I would still find a job Public Relations - same thing with communications.

"I don’t know what to do. AI tools can check for plagiarism because they literally scrape information. That can find word for word copying. However its also really easy to spot when you should be backing up your ideas with sources without ai. Big flag is when you are using course content and ideas and aren't citing the text or professors slides, or in some cases the sources your prof used for concepts. Your defense isn't a defense if you just aren't citing your sources. Why would he have to listen if you're not attributing properly? What defense? You have a video of yourself just writing. I'm not sure how you expect to have anyone ""take your side"". You are plagiarizing, full stop, if you aren't appropriately citing your sources. If you don't know how to cite or aren't sure what parts of your writing are coming up as plagiarised (AI or not). Then most schools have writing support. Those supports help with citation. If you have been told multiple times, and given the same resources, I'm wondering why you aren't listening to the feedback and instead are wasting time trying to prove or defend yourself? It's not malicious. But if you continue with being defensive about it instead of actually learning how to give credit, then you will find yourself in continuing hot water. Including academic misconduct, failing courses, and basically irreparably damaging your own reputation.no one likes the coworker that takes their ideas without giving them credit.

"Update to: Chilling chronicle of what I'm learning through dealing with my PI's abuse and research misconduct. Dear reddit, About a year ago, I came here to share my experience going through reporting my ex-PI for research misconduct: [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/45g9d2/offmychest_chilling_chronicle_of_what_im_learning/) And today, I came here to briefly share the rest of the story since then, and more importantly to share the technical aspects(process and tips) of misconduct investigation for those in a similar situation. **TL;DR: through extreme luck, I got my PhD, landed the job I wanted outside of academia, and have since moved on, and the investigation concluded recently finding my ex-PI guilty of research misconduct.** Without further ado, let's now go through some of the processes involved. After the formal allegations are filed, the inquiry begins where a preliminary assessment on the validity of the claims/allegations is performed. This could involve impounding relevant records (lab notebooks, laptops etc), and conducting interviews with relevant parties (the respondent, complainant, and other people who have direct knowledge of the claims in question), which the inquiry committee will use to make decisions on whether to open a formal investigation, or to conclude the inquiry without further action due to unsubstantiated claims. My understanding is that even formal allegations need to be reported to the federal funding agencies where relevant. The federal guideline suggests maximum 3-4 months to complete the inquiry phase, but the institute can easily request for an extension to this suggested timeline, so in practice, things could easily drag on. If the institute decides that an investigation is warranted, then they may expand the committee and more carefully go through the claims once again, and probably interview more people/require more documentations etc. Similar to the inquiry phase, there is a federal guideline for the timing of these things, but again, things tend to take much longer than suggested. Throughout the process, it will always feel like working with a black box without much visibility, and your/complainant's involvement would be mostly as an interviewee by the committee, but you're given an opportunity to read the drafts of reports before they are finalized and provide any comments/counterarguments for finalization. Hopefully, there shouldn't be any surprises in the report drafts, but due to the lack of transparency/interactions, you may have to provide a solid argument/evidence to prompt the committee to reconsider their reasoning and revise their decision. In my case, the inquiry committee initially concluded that my claims were unsubstantiated, and recommended that no further action be taken. It was due to a combination of incompetence and conflict of interest of the inquiry committee members, and fabricated evidence provided by my ex-PI/other post doc(s) who lied for him. On the other hand, while the inquiry was taking place, I continued to gather evidence and in doing so, I gathered even stronger pieces of evidence, which I was able to use in my response to the committee's report. With my response, the administration decided to disregard the committee's recommendation, and instead open a full investigation and also appoint a new committee for the investigation. I managed to defend/graduate and interview for jobs while this was ongoing, and moved to another city at the beginning of the investigation after being interviewed by the committee. After 6 months, I received a final draft report, finding the ex-PI guilty of research misconduct, and the report concludes with recommending ""appropriate sanctions"", whatever that means. This was about 4 months ago, but I believe no visible action has been taken on my ex-PI, though I'm pretty certain the PI will not be at the institute for long given the ridiculous amount of trouble the University had to deal with. On my end, I think I underwent something similar to PTSD in the following months since my move. I have definitely become a lot more careful with my words and trust, and I changed from someone never able to hide one's feelings on one's face to someone with a thick poker face. While I'd never recommend/wish this experience upon even my worst enemy, I'd like to believe that it was the right choice for me and a serious learning experience. That being said, I have to emphasize that I have been incredibly lucky, and if you ever need to do this yourself, please take advantage of my learnings: Some technical things to keep in mind when going through investigation: **1) Keep everything recorded (either voice recording or written summary of meetings etc)** (for voice recording, check first if your state is one party consent state). Do not trust anyone, not even your deans/administrators. I unfortunately ran into situations where the administrator/inquiry committee member was being rather shady with me where he tried to throw me under the bus through the inquiry, but I had recorded the conversation to save myself. Even if you cannot record the conversation, you should at least keep a written summary of the meetings. **2) Make sure your inquiry/investigation committee members are chosen adequately.** Specifically, you should ensure two requirements are met: 1) it should be obvious that the committee members should possess relevant scientific background to be able to assess the science of the misconduct claims, and 2) these individuals should be relatively free from the interest of the institute. The first part is easy to check by going through the potential member's publications list, but the second one is much harder to check and to object to. In my case, I blindly trusted the administration's pick of the initial inquiry committee composed of two administrators which turned out 1) not to have the right scientific background and 2) to have too much interest in prioritizing the University's interest. I remember that for investigation the process called for the complainant's explicit agreement on the choice of the investigation committee members, so please exercise your right and do your homework. You don't want to find yourself in a situation where you have to be teaching the basics of your field to the inquiry members. **3) Make sure to formally file complaints on any retaliatory actions with appropriate office/administrators on campus.** This could be the dean of students or a separate office for equality etc. Unfortunately these offices won't be really effective or timely enough in stopping unreasonable people from doing crazy things against you, but it does accomplish one thing: creating a formal complaint with the administrators **(read: known risk of a potential lawsuit)** and a record of unreasonable actions taken by the accused, should the institute decide to use this later on. Also do not be fooled into thinking that these offices are there to help you: they are absolutely not, and their job is to manage the risk for the university before there are lawsuits. In my case, it was evident that this office waited until the end of the investigation to draw their conclusions on whether or not my ex-PI took retaliation against me, even though they had collected all the evidence more than a year ago. **And lastly, continue on with your life to the best of your ability.** Remember that your life does not stop with this, nor would this ruin your life forever. You are still very much in control of and responsible for what happens to your career and your life, even when life throws you a curve ball. Finish that paper/thesis/defense. Keep searching/interviewing for jobs. It's much easier just to be depressed and fall into endless self-pity, but it will only worsen the situation. It's also helpful to have something to look forward to. I hope no one ever needs the information/tips I provided above, but in case there's need, I hope this gives some idea of what to expect and watch out for",Examination,Medium,1.0,web:reddit:r/gradschool:search:complaint,Medium,1,8029,1286,5,Update to: Chilling chronicle of what I'm learning through dealing with my PI's abuse and research misconduct.,0
"I have a dilemma: choosing between two excellent universities. I'd just like to preface this by saying that this is a throwaway for obvious reasons. Let me start by saying that I am an excellent student. I don't say this to ""blow my own horn"" or anything, it is relevant to the issue at hand. I have worked hard over the course of my high school career and have a certain amount of natural aptitude; furthermore, I was lucky enough to be born into a relatively well-off family—well off enough that I attended a very prestigious high school, known both nationally and internationally for its excellent results. Which brings me to my current situation: I have been offered a place at my dream university, Imperial College London, to study Biology and Spanish (a combined course). This university has everything: amazing facilities (which I have experienced first hand); a stellar reputation with domestic and foreign employers (though not so much with the foreign student body, it would seem); it was ranked 5th worldwide on QS last year and 10th worldwide in the THE rankings; and, to top it all off, is ideally located. In short: I love it. The course is great, the uni is great, the setting is great, it's just fantastic. Now, on the other hand, we have my other dream university, McGill. This is a relatively well-known university in a city with which I fell in love. Montreal is a beautiful, culturally-fascinating city, and an escape for French-English bilinguals such as myself. The people are nice, the weather is potentially amazing (not in winter, obviously) and the course looks like a very cool one. I neither visited the campus nor experienced the facilities, but the prospect of moving to North America is an exciting one. Furthermore, they are considering my major scholarship application ($10,000) and have already elected to grant me a $3,000 scholarship. This covers all of my freshman tuition fees, as French citizens pay a significantly discounted rate. And if that wasn't enough, I don't even have to take most freshman classes! most 100 level classes can be skipped because of transfer credits. I can do a joint honours major with two minors (or another major in, say, Spanish), come out with 2 degrees in 4 years and pay for only 3. Whilst living in a crazy new place. So essentially, I need advice. On the one hand, the draw of excellence is strong, and Imperial truly is a better school. On the other hand, the ""exotic"" nature of McGill as well as the prospect of significant beer money in my first year is very appealing.

"Student attempting to weaponize my ""no free-rider"" policy (some advice needed). My third-year undergraduate course has a semester-long group project where students worked in groups of four on an environmental engineering topic related to the course. Each group is to submit a project proposal and progress report in the middle of the course, do a group presentation and submit a final report (one week after the presentation) at the end of the semester. At the start of the semester, I outlined my ""no free-rider"" policy and stated that the potential grade penalties that a free-rider will encounter. After the group presentations but before the submission the final reports via Canvas LMS, I had a student claiming that she was representing her two other group members to complain about the lack of contribution by their fourth group mate. As proof, she provided screen shots of group whatsapp messages where the fourth student was slow to respond to messages (1 or 2 days later). To handle this situation, I emailed the fourth student to arrange a meeting to discuss this issue, and I told the group through email to include a CRediT statement in their final report (explained what it is and how to prepare it). I received the final report before I met with the fourth student and found our that they left out their group mate completely from the CRediT statement, making it look like she did not contribute to the project at all. I met with the fourth student and she was surprised when I informed her that her name was missing from the CRediT statement (they removed it in the final version of the report prior to submission). The fourth student came with evidence of all her contributions, including drafts of some of the sections in the final report that she wrote, slides that she made, data analysis that she performed, emails she sent to the group etc. She also told me that she and the student who made the complaint did not get along, and that student somehow managed to convince the other two group mates to ""gang up"" on her throughout the semester-long project? Apparently, the fourth student has been shrugging off their attempts to bully her (just grey-rocking them)? This is such a mess. These are third year students. This type of drama seems like something that you should only encounter in high school. This is the first time I am encountering this situation even though I have had this group project component in my course for the last 5 years. After considering the entire situation, I am definitely not going to penalize the fourth student. But should I be addressing this situation with the other three students? The teaching period is over and we are currently in the final exam period so it may be difficult to get hold of them for a meeting. Should I penalize the other three students for the stunt they pulled with the CRediT statement in their final report? If yes, what justification should I use? I currently don't have course policies to penalize this type of behavior. Also, moving forward, what steps should I implement to prevent something like this from happening again?

"Ways to stay sane during this school year. (coming from a college freshman) |. Looking back at my high school experience, there are a lot of things I wish I had done differently, mainly academically, but some mentally. What someone has probably told you, is that your experience with things is what you make it, rather than stuff related to your career, schooling, jobs, hobbies, life experiences like relationships or mental health. If Someone had told me this list of things as an incoming senior, I would have thought it was ridiculous but as I look back at it, there are a lot of ways that I wish I could go back and do differently. The first one being, try to balance your time out evenly. There are many methods and tools that can help you manage your time. A popular one is a Todo list. The benefits of the Todo list method are to have a visual list that you can look at to know what needs to be done. I used this method a lot due to the amount of homework you are given, it is different for everyone. As an upcoming college freshman, I will use this for my homework load since it has helped me a lot in my senior year. *Tip 1: You can also color code your classes with different colored highlighters so a different color represents a different class, (e.g.: green- science, blue- math, etc.) you can use this to highlight the things on your Todo list according to which class the assignment is for. So, if you have “biology essay” on your Todo list then you can highlight that in green since your science class is color coded green.* Next, by senior year you should know your way around the school and where your classes are, but if you are new see if your schedule is available to have it printed out, if it is, print it and memorize it. This makes you remember where your classes are and also won’t feel overwhelmed on trying to figure out where each class is. What helped me during my freshman year of high school was going to my freshman orientation where they showed all of us around and had us meet all of our teachers. *Tip 2: Reach out to your teachers before the first day of school, maybe your class schedule has their contact information on it and if it does, write the email to them introducing yourself and explain how you are just trying to get more familiar with your new environment. As I’m about to be a freshman in college, I have already done this with my professors!* Next, have a time when you wind down in the evening. Figure out a time to put your phone down and relax. This will make your brain shut off quicker when you turn off the light and you will be able to fall asleep faster! This is scientifically proven to help get better sleep because the blue light in your devices stimulates your eyes which are connectors to the brain. *Tip 3: Here are some pass times to help relax. Read a book, do your night routine, take a bath, do skincare, and my personal favorite, Journal.* Journaling helps in many different ways, one by helping your eyes focus on something that doesn’t have a screen attached. It also has benefits on helping with letting go of the things that are on your mind, rather that is relationship issues, family issues. It is also good for helping depression and anxiety. When writing down an entry, try to imagine that everything that is weighing you down in that moment is slowly moving from your brain onto the page of your journal. At your school, you probably have a counselor or some kind of person that is there to help with problems. Rather if that is family problems or others, they are normally there to help. If you are struggling mentally or extremely overwhelmed with schoolwork or life outside of school. Reach out to that person, rather than struggling with anxiety, depression or something else, don’t suffer in silence. *Tip 5: if you are struggling, please reach out to your counselor. They are there to help you, so please don’t struggle by yourself, remember that there are people that will help.* Another thing is do not procrastinate. Falling behind in schoolwork can also be very overwhelming once you realize you have fallen behind. There are a lot of ways to get yourself to not procrastinate. One thing I recommend is finding resources around your school or online to help you stay motivated. (discord servers for studying, studying with friends, going to the library and studying. If you go to a college, you can find a spare studying room and study in there since that is what they are used for. *Tip 6: if you are still falling behind, ask your teachers or school counselor if there is a tutor that could help or another teacher that could help you after school. If you are in college there might be a tutoring center that you could go to, and they will help you.* This next tip might not be for some people, especially if you have social anxiety like me but, stay involved in extracurricular activities. This will keep you wanting to keep up in your classes so you can participate in them. For me, I’m joining theater, choir, and a creative writing club to help me meet new friends and be more motivated in keeping up with my classes. *Tip 7: there are many organizations and clubs you could join as well as sports. Growing up I never played sports, but I was involved with my choir and now that I am in college, I’m involving myself in things I’m interested in.* This might be one that you already know about researching your classes before taking them helps you figure out what the class is about way before you take the class, now this is probably more for college students since in high school there are a limited amount of courses you can take but for college kids It is probably your best bet to look into the course way before you take it so you know what you are getting into. The last thing is to set goals for yourself, rather than personal goals, academic goals, finance goals, etc. It will help you and your mind stay organized with what you are trying to achieve. For me the way I do it is I write them on a paper with different categories like Finance, Academic, Career, etc. you can search up “smart goals template” on google and go off of that to write your own smart goals.

"Sadly, that's an administration issue, which is also the professor's responsibility to bring up. If the students aren't *prepared* for it because they didn't have prereqs or were taught poorly, and still passed, that's also bad pedagogy, from the institution. That's where the professor brings the issue up with admin, and recommends the student to withdraw and take remedial coursework - not just let them fail. That recommendation of withdrawal and remedial work (or tutoring if they are not terribly far behind) is *also* a form of meeting students where they are. It requires proactive work on the professor, which I've seen very lacking in my decades in academia. Most I know don't recommend such remedial work unless they are specifically asked. This works the same in music where people are expected to perform at a certain level, and if they can't, they are told to drop the course, take lessons, and reapply when they meet the minimum audition requirements. Music programs in colleges also make every music student have an audition and take a music theory placement exam to place them at the appropriate level of coursework. Math departments may be well served by this approach as well - also another metric of learning where students are, so they can be met there. However, in instructional pedagogy, the study and science of teaching, is the same across fields. It doesn't matter the subject. There are different subject matters, with their own criteria of success in each field, but the science behind teaching - the relaying of complicated subject matter into understandable units, using varied methodologies, learning styles, and approaches remains the same. What you brought up isn't as much about instructional pedagogy insomuch as institutional pedagogical failure. At the end of the day, a class's success is a direct reflection of the teacher and the institution, especially if the institution is failing the teacher who then fails the students. That happens in math all the time: one missed calculation can throw off every other calculation. That is very important for a professor to know from a covering their own self aspect. I have sat on committees where it can, and has, been used as metrics to deny and remove tenure and fire underperforming teachers (usually through non-renewed contracts). Constant student failure is a red flag, and if I'm not in that department and no one was brought up the institution failures, then the teacher in question will be assigned the blame. A response to said committee of "" Most of my students fail because I'm just teaching the course"" without trying to get students the help they need, get them out of the classroom and into the appropriate classroom, wouldn't fly with most of the committees I've served on.

"Accepted, but had to drop classes because of financial aid issues. I am heart broken. I had my heart set on DePaul for years. I just transferred in for winter quarter but due to my transcripts being severely delayed my fafsa and financial aid package/offer were also late and so I had to enroll without knowing how things look. I was relying on my Pell grant, which has been max amount for the last two years, and the DAPP scholarship I was promised. Unfortunately, that scholarship is actually much less than anticipated and with everything I can gather between grants, scholarship and federal loans, I still can’t cover even half of yearly tuition. I feel dead inside. I haven’t been able to stop crying for 2 days now and I am so filled with rage. I come from an extremely disadvantaged background - arrived in the states by myself with no money and my only connection was an estranged aunt which told me I can’t stay with her for more than 2 months. I was 18. I got a job, eventually my own place, made it a home, worked through full time community college and got an AA. I genuinely thought that working my ass off and doing everything I can to give myself a chance of a good college would pay off. Like. I was living under the delusion that hard work and playing fair would give me an equal chance to everyone else here.

"What do I do. This has been living rent free in my head for a few weeks because I am conflicted between my own morals(?) and pragmatism. There is this paper I wrote as a collaborative project between my university and a foreign university. I visited the univesity for a month in 2022, did some experiments, then came back. A lot of things went awry during the experiments largely due to the collaborators' failure to get materials in time and inadequate equipments, but thats another story. They sent me data two months after I returned to the US, and I did the data analysis and large chunks of writings. It took a lot longer than it should have partly because one, I had my own projects to work on, two, I spent a lot time trying to make the sense of data that seemed to contradict past studies of similar natures, and lastly, I got a little lazy over time. After my own defense and dissertation submission, I finally sent off the manuscript to a journal on the second week of November, and expected to hear around early January because I expected that things would slow down during December. In the meantimes, I finishsd all my paperwork with my grad school, moved out of my state for a new job in NJ with a plan to fly back in May for my graduatiob A week ago, I logged into the submission portal out of curiosity, and it turned out that the journal actually denied the manuscript a day after Christmas, but for some reason, none of us was notified, not even my PI, the corresponding author. I called my PI immediately and notified him what happened, and he said he didnt get the denial email either but would get back to me a day later after talking with other co-authors including my writing manager.its been a week and I have not heard back. On one hand, I feel like I have to be proactive in this matter as the first author and to not damage the relationship between the universities.

If we all go about life with the “it’s not owed” attitude, then what differentiates us from animals or reptiles? It doesn’t cost money to offer verbal condolences. It doesn’t take up too much of your time considering how people make time during their super-busy day for a lot unnecessary things….unnecessary and unhealthful snacking, gossiping, jerking off, checking social media, watching Tiktok, etc. My boss didn’t say anything at all when I said I would be a little late to work due to my uncle’s death which I found out about when I woke up in the morning to get ready for work.

"Is my advisor being passive aggressive. I’m a third year PhD. In the fall I defended my thesis proposal, which my advisor was extremely supportive of, but one of my committee members (more senior than advisor) eviscerated it. This had a major impact on my mental health, as I had not experienced this level of rejection before (typical “gifted kid” problems). I admit that my second year was not great overall. My field has a pretty steep learning curve, so there’s not a huge expectation to produce novel ideas early on but I was fucking up in like basic classes (that my advisor taught). Last semester, my weekly meetings with my advisor seemed to get progressively contentious. Little things like, “you probably wouldn’t be good at this since you don’t pay close attention to detail.” We had an end of year meeting where he basically told me that it wasn’t acceptable for me to not be the strongest student in his classes - he then retracted that at our next meeting because it sounded “too harsh”. We agreed that I should have deliverables at every subsequent meeting to help keep me accountable. I have an internship over the summer, and I’ve been really trying to make up for the last year of subpar work. I made huge edits to my lit review to try to appease the committee member, and I sent the doc to advisor for feedback. He said he needed 2 days for review, I sent it Monday at 8am. He said he made “light comments” because he didn’t have a problem with the way it was before. He highlighted a term, which I have seen used multiple times in this context in reputable sources, and commented “this has a very specific meaning. Look it up.” At our meeting today, he said “let’s make sure the next meeting is scheduled with enough time in advance for you to get me the deliverable, in case you want to send me another 30 page document.” I’m like, you asked for exactly 2 days for this, and I did that! It just felt really snarky. He also had some comments about “no name” citations, which I found out were published in adequate journals but the authors mainly publish in a different field. Am I being overly sensitive? Am I projecting because I don’t feel like I’m doing enough? Our relationship used to feel a lot less effortful. Now I feel like an idiot every time we talk.

"Sick and tired of a master's program ""for working professionals"" treating me like I'm 18. I know that this is outside of the normal range of post from doctorate candidates here, but I'm at my wit's end and my friends and partner have heard enough ranting. I am doing an MPP part time at a university that is convenient to me. This program prides itself as being ""for working professionals"" (though most of my classmates appear to be right out of undergrad). I am only a few years out, but my first priority is my job - I'm on a performance based reimbursement plan (so grades do matter) and they treat me well. But, this program just seems to be fucking ridiculous and I'm over it. Please forgive the incoming petty (and maybe mean rant). * I am in a class where the attendance policy says that missing more than 1 class requires extra credit. Missing more than 2 classes means that ""it will be hard to get a B."" I have already turned down a work trip and may have to again in a couple weeks because of this absurd policy. This isn't even a lab or something where being present matters - you could listen in and get the same info. I understand that it doesn't foster discussion the same way (not that she stops talking enough for it to even happen.) so I get losing participation points but how is participation 20% of my grade and missing more than 2 classes just automatically pushes me to a C? Come on. * When I talked to my advisor about the above issue (in the context that if you had a covid scare and needed to stay home while you waited for results, that would count against you), she said that ""it's up to the instructor"" and that I could ""drop the class if I wanted."" Yes, but idk - maybe just take some responsibility and don't let grad professors have such obnoxious attendance policies? * All the fucking group projects y'all. One of my classes this semester has a group project and it's the second one to say it's important because ""in the real world, you have to work with people to write policy memos."" Guess what? I *am* in the real world. And I *do* write policy memos. But you know what? There are 40 hours / week where the person I'm writing the memo with is expected to be available for questions and if they aren't, that's a pretty big deal. Outside of that, they actually *know* how to write the damn memo - we might disagree on style or word choice - maybe there is a squabble over how the tone reflects intent - but that's it. In a class last semester, the professor used the first (individual) memo to create group where he balanced the groups (put someone with an A, a B, a C, etc. in the same group). I ended up having to babysit my group through the process. It's not my job to teach my colleagues. But I have to if I want to get a good grade. Idk - maybe my professors should do their their jobs and stop shirking responsibility? Group projects where I have to find time outside of work and class is silly - the \~real world\~ that my professors seem so obsessed with literally does not require that. * This one is maybe a bit controversial. But, I'm tired of having to treat everyone's political opinions with some kind of reverence because ""academic discourse."" If you think racism isn't real, you're wrong. You might even be a bad person, but you're def wrong and as a WOC, I don't want to have to engage with your racist and violent ideas because \~discourse\~. I don't want to spend half my class time listening to the instructor convince a student that lobbying is impactful when he is just naive (e.g., ""but why would politicians. take the money?""). Send the student home with some reading or at least relive the rest of us from class. * I hate that we treat knowing pre-algebra as a basic requirement, but not civics. I had to test into the stats class (which let's be honest only taught me how to pass the exam, not anything about stats) but I started a class this semester talking about the three branches of government for. weeks. Why don't we require students to test into that? * I understand exams, but didn't we all agree that having your performance in a 15 week graduate level course determined by 4 hours of your life is silly? Because it feels ridiculous and silly. At no point in my job has a client said, ""quick. tell me what section of the Federal Acquisition Regulation related to technology transaction agreements? And if you get it wrong, I'm gonna fire you."" And even when a question like that has come up, I've always had the ability to say, ""Hm, I'm not sure. Let me send you an email with the excerpt when I'm back at my desk."" I'm just tired y'all. I get that I'm in school and it's not just going to be rainbows and daisies all the time. I also get that I probs just need to get over some of this stuff and is the result of me being unnecessarily exhausted. But, this program sells itself as a program for professionals - hell, it sells itself as a program for ""mid career professionals,"" and it really isn't. I am tired of the babying, the unpreparedness of my colleagues, the obnoxious desire to stick to ""the rules"" even when they don't make that much sense. I just feel like the program is trying really hard and by extension some of the professors are trying really hard to feel / be more important / special than they are. I just want to shake them and say ""no one is in this program because it's \~prestigious\~ or they realllllly wanted to take your class, we're all here because it made sense.

"Thoughts on moving abroad? (Discussion). Hiya! I’m looking at schools and I thought I’d ask for some advice/stories/experience. Those who moved to another country for PhD (or grad school in general), what factors led you to make that decision? What are some things to look out for when considering PhD abroad/overseas? If you stayed domestic, why? Another way to approach this: How would one swing their area of study to travel out of the country (besides just for conferences)? Are there more/less opportunities to do research or teach abroad? Could one reasonably/feasibly spend significant time in other geographical locations during school? I’d like to imagine something similar to study abroad in undergrad, but I’m sure that’s an unfair assumption I’m making based on lack of knowledgeability lol.

This past quarter I took a lower division computer science course with what ended up being an interesting professor to say the least. Aside from minor complaints like him not knowing if he had TAs to teach the mandatory recitations that term or sounding like he was completely unsure about everything, he also: - spent a decent amount of lecture time either confusing himself or trying to work through a mistake he made on the slides (like does (2^8 * 16) equal (2^(16*8))) - frequently forgot why he had something on his slides, why he was going to teach something, or what he was going to teach, usually resulting in an odd pause while he read the slides or Wikipedia article - specified in his syllabus and during the first lecture which weeks would not have a quiz… which he then ignored and gave quizzes during those weeks anyway - edited the syllabus about half way through the course to remove where it had said there would be no quizzes during specific weeks - appeared to not really know the programming language he was teaching the course in, with students correcting basic errors multiple times and him questioning if they were right — they were - used a “textbook” he had written himself that was full of serious errors, incorrect information, and general bad practice. Sometimes you would get told you would get extra credit for pointing these errors out, sometimes he just was obvious and said it was just how he did it (which, isn’t really a thing if your code literally will not run) - assigned homework with requirements that he wasn’t sure were even possible, but said he would deduct points anyway if it didn’t meet the criteria (he did end up dropping that) - exams had tons of errors, inconsistent questions (a question on the midterm may also be on the final, but with a different answer)and questions that relied on the output of his code on the book — the code that does run - no one knew what we needed to bring to the final exam. He would not respond to email, and the TAs didn’t know either. 2 hours before it was scheduled, he emails and says he wants to make sure it was clear that we needed to bring a laptop because the final would be on canvas - completely ignored me when I questioned his grading on my final (I emailed about a week before grades were due, and a couple days after getting the grade back), instead just submitting the final grade with no contact, no explanation, nothing.

TLDR; My school led me along and told me to leave, and now I have an extra 30k of student loans and am significantly poorer and stressed than when I started. \------------------------- So, I've had immense trouble with my masters program and I honestly shouldn't have led it on as much as I did to start, but, I did, and now I feel kinda totally and utterly screwed over, and I don't know what to do. I've been doing a grad program since 2020, but it's been constant issues with advisors not listening to me, administration and advisors not responding to emails (sometimes for months, sometimes not at all), the school ignoring an abuse report I submitted, and me having to pay for semesters again because no one would respond when I needed clarification on papers and assignments, no matter how many emails I'd write (and because I had numerous close family members die the wrong time that made it hard for me to focus). But, after all the weirdness and me trying to stay with it and just finish it out since this one year program turned into thousands of my money, tens of thousands of family members pitching in, and two rounds of big (fortunately federal) student loans to keep it all going and to help support me with school and life in the meantime, I was told (after literal months of my advisors and teachers not responding to anything I said) that I should exit my program altogether and come back once I'm doing better with my disability, when I expressed in perhaps 50 emails this year that I needed advising on my thesis and on numerous assignments where I was only given a sentence of guidance as an initial parameter. I've had unimaginable stress dealing with the school with them deleting my accounts, gaslighting me, not responding, demanding money, denying services, and being absolutely cruel in some responses. The worst part is that, yeah, I am facing weird disabilities that do greatly limit my work and I can do the assignments, it's just that I can't handle going to grad school and writing a thesis while having less than zero support through the whole process apart from random emails that say ""You can do it, I know you can"", without ever answering the questions I had. I'm less limited in doing the assignments by my own health than I am by their ongoing bullshit. I'd like to go to school again, but with my disabilities, I don't really see taking out other loans to go to school as an option as I'll never be able to afford paying them off.

We are here to support you.* ***Preface:*** *Why is AA banned? Why is this post locked?* *This post is a joint production from the moderator team. We wanted to give some perspective directly about the recent AA decision and shed some light again on our community's stance on discussion of AA.* *AA is a difficult, complex, nuanced topic. Whenever AA comes up, we see and remove multiple violations of rules 1, 6, and 9. This is not about censorship, controlling narratives, promoting specific ideologies, politics, or anything else. It's about making A2C a supportive community and helpful resource for college admissions.* *Every time—every time—these AA threads start, the mod team has to remove dozens or hundreds of distasteful, hurtful, bigoted, racist, awful things. Some of it is subtle, and some is overt.* *We also get complaints, often from our Black and Latino members, that they felt hurt, attacked, or unwelcome because of the comments they read.

There are other places online and on Reddit where you can discuss this to your heart's content. Since this type of discussion also tends to draw attention from people outside our regular users, we are also locking the comments on this post.* ## What was the Supreme Court Decision? To understand the Supreme Court’s decision about affirmative action, it might be helpful to recap about what affirmative action is and isn’t. Affirmative action is a genre of policy that aims to help groups that have been historically discriminated against or disadvantaged in society — especially in areas like education and employment. This can include groups based on race, gender, or ethnicity. In admissions, AA considers an applicant's race, ethnicity, or gender as one factor among many in the admissions process. The goal is to promote diversity on campus &amp; provide opportunities for historically underrepresented groups. Colleges have never admitted students solely based on these factors. They use them in conjunction with other measures like academic performance, extracurricular activities, leadership qualities, etc. That brings us to the decision. In *Students for Fair Admissions v. President and Fellows of Harvard College* (*SFFA v. Harvard*), the Supreme Court ruled that schools like Harvard and UNC can not use race as a factor in college admissions decisions. This was not the first case to address Affirmative Action and the history is important for understanding what the decision does - and does not - say. The most important cases are *Regents of the University of California v. Bakke*, *Grutter v. Bollinger* (known as Bakke) and *Fisher v. University of Texas I and II* (known as Fisher). The Bakke decision was the first to find that schools can't reserve a certain number of spots for specific groups of applicants. What might be most important in Bakke is the idea that universities **are** legally allowed to aim for a racially diverse student body to enhance education. This is one reason why 'diversity' is a term often used by universities. The *Grutter* and *Fisher* cases looked at how closely the use of race in college admissions should be examined. This review process is known as 'strict scrutiny' — it means that if race is to be used, its use must be carefully tailored to support clear social and/or political interests. These interests typically include correcting past discrimination that violated the Constitution or particular law. At stake in another case, *SFFA v. Harvard*, was whether the use of race in college admissions met the criteria of strict scrutiny. In particular, Affirmative Action in college admissions was a policy that came after [Jim Crow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws) and that was aimed at remediating continuing segregation and racial discrimination. It gave institutions a legal mechanism for bringing in students who hadn't historically had access to higher education at nearly equal levels to white students. As noted, this question about strict scrutiny had previously been answered in *Bakke —* **yes**, using race in college admissions **did** satisfy conditions for strict scrutiny. That case laid out three criteria for affirmative action policies. Policies must not: 1. Last forever – that is, the policy must end at some point when the harms it attempts to fix are no longer as significant. 2. Impose quota systems or “outright racial balancing.” 3. Impose “mechanical, predetermined diversity bonuses” being awarded to applicants. Only a “tip” or “plus” on an admissions file is constitutionally tolerable, and only for a limited time. This most recent Supreme Court decision found that Harvard and UNC’s admission policies did not meet all three criteria. Harvard and UNC’s admissions policies were then found to be in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. ## So what does it mean that these policies were struck down by the court? *SFFA v. Harvard* prohibits the use of race in admissions. But the Roberts opinion clarifies that “nothing in this opinion should be construed as prohibiting universities from considering an applicant’s discussion of how race affected his or her life, be it through discrimination, inspiration, or otherwise.” This makes it unclear how college admissions will change and what role experiences tied to race will continue to play in the admissions process. In theory, admissions offices could still prioritize applicants who demonstrate grit, resilience, or other values gained through an experience related to race. Does that sound somewhat… convoluted? It is. The decision reduces the ability of schools to directly use race *per se* in their admissions scoring schemes. (If you’re interested in these schemes, you can read Harvard’s—one of the ones that generated the lawsuit—right here.) However, it may not prevent schools from constructing admissions schemes that value experiences linked to race and building diverse classes around them. Now is it clear! Still no? What is clear: race will receed from being a formal, explicit criteria (like legacy status, cough) used to assign points in an admissions process. It won’t appear on CDS reports, for example. It will receed into the relatively murkier waters of “holistic admissions processes,” where its continued role (if any) in admissions decisions will be determined on an office-by-office basis, and likely with the heavy intervention of university legal teams. ## What are the implications of the decision? There are plenty of outlets where one can read about the possible rammifications of the court’s decision. Here is the ACLU’s take on the potential impact: &gt;A decision blocking universities’ ability to consider race will almost certainly mean a significant drop in the number of students of color being admitted to selective universities. In fact, that’s what lower courts in both cases found after closely studying several race-neutral alternatives like a class-based affirmative action or plans similar to Texas’s top 10 percent plan, which guarantees Texas students who graduated in the top 10 percent of their high school class automatic admission to all state-funded Texas universities. Less diverse campuses will harm students of color and white students alike, and take us backward in our efforts to overcome the country’s shameful legacy of racism and racial inequality. &gt; &gt;A decision outlawing consideration of race in college admissions could also make it harder for employers to take steps to promote equity and diversify their workforce. Dozens of government programs that address past and current discrimination, advance racial equity, and seek to close the racial wealth gap, such as business incubator programs, could also be jeopardized. **If you’re trying to make up your mind about the issue, here are some questions you may wish to consider:** * Do you think the 'good things that come from having a mix of different people' should be a priority for colleges when they decide who gets in? How do you think having a diverse student body is connected to fairness, making everyone feel included, and doing what's right? Are they all the same thing, or not? * We know that the rules used in past cases like Grutter and SFFA v Harvard didn't make everyone happy—there were a lot of conflicting opinions about what criteria should be applied to evaluate the legitimacy of AA. What do you think are the really important things the court should consider when it's being super careful (i.e., applying the standard of ""strict scrutiny"") about making decisions, like in cases about affirmative action? What types of data or arguments should inform its decisions, for example? ## Resources and Further Reading about the Decision Here are a few selected resources, including responses from the schools themselves to the ruling, that you might be interested to read. * [*The ACLU’s page on the Affirmative Action Harvard case*](https://www.aclu.org/news/racial-justice/what-you-need-to-know-about-affirmative-action-at-the-supreme-court) * [*The full audio transcript of the c*](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2022/20-1199)*ourt case* * [*The court’s full written decision*](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/20-1199_hgdj.pdf) * [*A longer article by Brookings about the decisions leading to the ruling.*](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-supreme-court-is-poised-to-reverse-affirmative-action-heres-what-you-need-to-know/) * [*NACAC’s statement about the decision*](https://go.nacacnet.org/webmail/658113/483600145/d01142808754f478c13548044efcb51a721bab851f5d84950033df20989f40a9) *School Responses* * [*Cornell*](https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2023/06/president-pollack-message-supreme-court-decision) * [*Harvard*](https://www.harvard.edu/admissionscase/2023/06/29/supreme-court-decision/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=hu-twitter-general&amp;utm_medium=social) * [*Tufts*](https://president.tufts.edu/news/2023/06/29/todays-supreme-court-decision/?fbclid=PAAaabczA_kIoEYA7xDqDve1MrjhaYBrHTSFB6GZm4CjHDTnmLOjabCDFjxr8_aem_AR8yJXZa8AeRLmuDZkUZzbhPG3C-s0C5NkWj_ZSqLj5xo644Uc7IO-6AWrRQBusCMbE) * [*Northwestern*](https://www.northwestern.edu/leadership-notes/2023/todays-supreme-court-ruling-on-race-and-admissions.html) * [*Michigan*](https://president.umich.edu/news-communications/messages-to-the-community/statement-on-supreme-courts-affirmative-action-ruling/) * [*Yale*](https://president.yale.edu/president/statements/supreme-court-decisions-regarding-admissions-higher-education) We’ll add more resources as we come across them",Academic,Medium,1.0,web:pullpush:r/ApplyingToCollege:submission:complaint,Medium,1,11149,1583,0,On the Supreme Court's affirmative action decision (some notes from the mods).,0

"Context: there was a school shooting at his institution, UVA, last week. Larry Sabato teaches at UVA, where three students died and thousands had to shelter in place overnight on November 13-4 because of an active shooter. Some students were stuck in public places such as the library for 12 hours. The official university Twitter instructed students to “RUN. HIDE. FIGHT.” The school made classes optional through Thanksgiving break, so many understandably went home early for break, or just stayed home from classes. Dr. Sabato posted this after the majority of his students declined to attend the last class before break. In the comments he agrees with others who say things like “kids these days” and chastises those who failed to show up. Sabato himself chalks up the low attendance to the impending break rather than the horrific communal tragedy. I am not affiliated with UVA, and am a graduate student elsewhere, but the way UVA handled this situation has been horrific. My heart goes out to these kids because, goddamn, they’re just kids.

"Question about SUNY: establishing residency policy? Has anyone else come across this. This is a question about establishing residency in NY for the purpose of receiving in-state tuition at a SUNY school. I am currently a student at SUNY Binghamton, and am trying to apply for residency, and to that end, I must produce 3 documents as proof of domicile. One possible document is a driver's license or non-driver state identification. I have been informed that a learner's permit is not an acceptable document. This does not make sense to me, since the NY DMV has told me that the the two documents are essentially the same, other than the permit allowing one to begin driving. In fact, I could go to the DMV and just trade in my permit for a state ID without producing any further documentation and pay a small fee. Binghamton holds that this is their interpretation of SUNY's policy: http://www.suny.edu/sunypp/documents.cfm?doc_id=402 SUNY Binghamton: http://www.binghamton.edu/student-accounts/residency.html However, SUNY Albany has a different take on it as they do allow one to present their permit: http://www.albany.edu/studentaccounts/res_apply.php Admittedly, SUNY Stony Brook and SUNY Buffalo may also have the same take on the issue, seeing as they use similar wording. My overall question is: what is the reasoning behind it? http://www.stonybrook.edu/bursar/residency/ http://studentaccounts.buffalo.edu/policies/residency.php It puts me in a rather inconvenient bind since I would effectively have to give up my permit for a whole year (the DMV does not allow you to hold two forms of ID such as a permit and a normal ID at the same time, since in their eyes, who would need to?) just to be in possession of a non-driver state identification at the time of residency application, thus postponing my current driver's education, and prohibiting me from advancing on to a full license.

"UPenn vs Columbia. Commit day is getting closer and I’m still unsure of which to pick.

Cost isn’t an issue for both, fortunate enough to have gotten an outside full scholarship.

"Check out r/financialcareers for second, third and fourth opinions.

""Target"" schools, the US News Top 20 institutions in most cases, afford the best opportunities in business/finance (think investment banking/management consulting, even vc/pe for top students at HYPSM). This is because these schools offer the best OCR opportunities. As a case in point, check out [Wharton's placement record](http://www.vpul.upenn.edu/careerservices/files/WHA_2016cp.pdf). As you move down the US News list, there is more competition for fewer opportunities.

"Did a great job as a graduate student TA last semester, but did not get the respect I deserved. Hey everyone, I was a graduate TA for a calculus II course for a last semester, but something happened that I would like to discuss My primary duty involved running discussion sessions. I worked extremely hard to provide quality sessions, preparing very well for the material that was to be covered that day, and tried to explain everything the very best I could. It worked out well, because the students constantly gave me praise on how extremely helpful the discussion sessions were and how much they were learning from them. One reason for this is that according to the students, the instructor was terrible at teaching/explaining any concept, so this is another reason why the discussions helped them so much In addition, they told me that I was always willing to go out of my way to help(which I was), and was extremely fair with grading exams. It showed on my course evaluation - the reviews were phenomenal, I received tons of great comments. Now what's the problem? I feel like the professor(officially has the lecturer title since his only job is to teach and he doesn't do any research) I TA'd for did not appreciate me at all. When I had my final meeting with him at the end of the semester, I told him ""It was really great working with you this semester"". He had no response, and just looked at me with an unhappy smug look on his face. I had a hard time actually believing this, so I said it again a bit later, and yet I got the same reaction from him. Now, I understand why he may have been a bit upset. I was a tad late with the grading on exams at a few points, and admittedly, this is on me. He did comment earlier in the semester that I should get grading done faster and didn't seem the happiest about it, so that genuinely is something I will try to improve upon this semester. However, there were no complaints about this on my course evaluation or throughout the semester from any student. I find this really infuriating. I basically taught this dude's entire calculus course for him since he couldn't teach, and he gives me a smug look on his face. It felt really disheartening, because I did the absolute very best I could to provide the students quality discussion sessions, and they really appreciated the sessions and really loved me as a TA.

Western Financial Modeling with AEO status for Ivey vs. Waterloo Financial Analyst Risk Management. Hi Reddit! I am a Canadian Student and having a hard time deciding on which university to attend for the upcoming year. I have been accepted to both Western Ontario for Financial Modeling with an AEO (Advance Entry Opportunity) for Ivey as well as FARM ( Financial Analyst Risk Management) Program at Waterloo. My career aspirations are towards finance and would like to work as in Investment banker in the near future. I am having a hard time time deciding both schools and have listed a few advantages and disadvantages of both of them below: Financial Modeling Western: Advantages: Alumni Network Financial Modeling is a solid path for investment banking/trading? Western Ivey is a 1st tier business school &amp; is known for finance in Canada Social Life as well as the people there seem more outgoing and friendly compares to Waterloo Disadvantages: I heard Ivey's name is going quite downhill because of the number of grads coming out every year Tuition price is much more than it is at Waterloo ~75k for 4 years The 2+2 program seems like I won't be getting as much of a business education as I would at the FARM since it's a longer period of time Job opportunities are limited and is very hard to get for the first two years as I have heard that employers don't put a lot of importance on the AEO status. Waterloo FARM Advantages: Waterloo coop is world renown and I will most likely get a job from first year as coop starts from sophomore summer. A lot of the coop placements are in the states and I hope to work there in the near future The program seems tailored for finance I have the opportunity to fast track my CFA designation Cheap tuition ~50k for 5 years Disadvantage: Waterloo isn't know as well as Ivey is The environment and the people aren't the same as they are in Ivey ( they don't seem outgoing or businessy-ish?)

"Grad school housing.help, I guess. So.I hope this is where this belongs. Google doesn't know how to give me answers to my situation (shocking, I know). I am not attending grad school. I don't think I could mentally handle it and I really screwed up a few too many semesters in undergrad to have the GPA to scrape into applying. My boyfriend IS applying. He has, just finished last week. He and I have a plan to live together while he's in grad school. I'd work full time. I'm a little anxious about this. We don't have acceptance letters, so we don't know if he's even going to be accepted anywhere (thanks GRE!) so this may be a little premature. I've tried scouring the websites of the schools he's applied to looking for their housing policies. Everywhere seems to have some something for ""spouses, partners, and children"" (quoted exactly from some of the websites). My issue is, I've told him that if it's cheaper for him to live on campus without me, he should do that, but he's adamant about us living together. Currently, I've told him that he should contact schools that accept him (when/if the do) and ask about our situation. But I'm antsy. Is it at all possible, generally speaking, for us to live together under ""partners"" or would that be using an LGBTQ+ relationship term for married couples? Like, does ""partner"" include unmarried significant other? Another question, and I know what you're probably going to say. We've talked about maybe getting married. I don't know that either of us really cares about a big thing. I'd be find with getting married at the courthouse or whatever. I'd be willing to do that if it meant I could live with him while he's in grad school. Has anyone done that? I know it sounds stupid, but is it? My mom has said that that isn't a reason to get married, but it wouldn't be the reason, it would be something that just pushes it forward a little bit.

"Mistake Made of not enforcing attendance policy. Hello all, I’m new to being an adjunct professor. and I’ve made quite a lot of mistakes one of the ones that I made is that since I was navigating multiple classes, I wasn’t the best at keeping track of students absences. And usually I was a little bit too nice when it came to excusing absences. My attendance policy states that after four absences, I normally would drop you from the course and then it goes on to say excessive absences will lead to a reduced grade or may lead to a failing grade. I have multiple student into her pass threshold of the amount of absences allowed. I don’t want to fail them, so I’m assuming I would just go with that I’m allowed to reduce their grade portion of my attendance policy.

"Needing moral support for mental health leave of absence. Hi everyone, I'm just writing this to see if anyone has any helpful words about leaves of absence. I'm a 3rd year PhD student in the sciences and I've been thinking of taking a leave of absence for quite a long time and think the time has come to start it and I'm so scared to pull the trigger. I've struggled with anxiety and depression for most of my life, but it's gotten particularly bad since starting grad school. I moved across the country from my entire family, covid happened, I had a bad committee meeting that led to me having to delay my advancement to candidacy, etc., that has all led to me being extremely unhappy the past year. It's extremely difficult to get up in the mornings usually and get myself to lab. I try working from home but have trouble focusing. Some days I can do it, but I can't get into a consistent groove, but even on my productive days I would say I'm still unproductive compared to many people. All to say, the state of my mental health is having a huge impact on my work and I feel so bad for being so unproductive. I feel like I need to take some time away to get ahold of my mental health and get myself to a stable state so that I can return on a better note and advance to candidacy and get through the 2nd half of my PhD. For the past year I've been going to therapy and recently started antidepressants, which have both helped, but really are not going to solve the problem. Because of that, I want to take a leave for the 2nd half of this fall semester (I would take the leave the whole semester but due to dumb policies I would lose my access to mental health treatment if I did that, which seems counterproductive, so I'm only going to take half of a semester as a compromise). I'm ready to take the leave starting in the next few weeks, but I'm so scared of disappointing my advisor and I have trouble feeling validated enough to take a leave. I think she realizes that I haven't been doing well, but I think it'll likely come as a surprise to her that I want to take a leave and I don't want her to think less of me if I take a leave. I'm a normal person and I care about my work and I want to finish my PhD, but I just need a long break. I'm also worried that my advisor and department will be upset that I'll be wasting some of my fellowship from tuition that went unused. I'm also worried that I'm not ""sick"" enough to take a leave. I've been unhappy for a long time, but I think I look fine to most people, and I'm not suicidal or anything, I'm just at the point where I don't want to do this anymore right now and I feel like this is what I need. I also think it's important that I don't let myself get to the point of extreme breakdown to allow myself to take a break. I need time to just relax and most importantly I feel like I need to spend some extended time with my family to make up for time lost during covid, and I feel like taking a leave right now is the only way to do that and if I don't I'll continue being depressed because I miss them so much and I have absolutely no time in the next year when I would be able to take a long extended break to see them again. Also for context, I suffer from severe burnout and I have tried just taking a month off before earlier this summer and it didn't really help the problem much, so that's why I think I need a legitimate leave of absence for several months rather than taking a month off. Also note that I'm done with my coursework and my qualifying exam, so I don't have any deadlines or specific things I need to get done this fall. I do need to advance to candidacy by next fall through having a committee meeting where they approve of my candidacy, but that can happen next spring and theoretically should not be too much work that I haven't already done, so I'm not going to be pushing things off or missing anything by missing most of this fall. Clearly, one of the reasons I'm struggling with commiting to taking a leave and accepting that it's okay to take a leave is because I'm worried about what others will think of me, which is one of my main sources of anxiety in general. So, I'm just wondering if anyone else that's taken a leave has any advice on how to talk to your advisor about it, how to advocate for yourself, and how to overall accept to yourself that it's okay to take time off? Thank you so much for any words of advice. &lt;3",Academic,High,2.0,web:reddit:r/gradschool:search:exam schedule problem,High,2,4420,861,0,Needing moral support for mental health leave of absence.,0

"My Laziness Will Cost Me. Freshman here at a community college. Had a 4.0 last semester because I want to transfer to a good school. I am in a honors program here and we had people transfer to prestigous schools like Yale and Colombia. I was below average in high school. Had decent grades, but did nothing with them. I wanted to turn things around at my college, so I started taking honors classes and joining clubs. I somehow managed to be appointed President of my campus' PTK chapter. I was applying to various internships throughout the year. But I always did things at the last minute. I was lazy and irresponsible. I have professors who see me as an excellent student, but they would be less than impressed if they had the full picture. I began to slack heavily in early April. The missing assignments started piling up. I had a family emergency and sleeping issues during this period, but if we are being honest, I could have pushed myself and gotten everything done. Now it's the last week. I can still get it done. At least that's what I tell myself. I wish I knew the exact cause and remedy to my problem, but I feel that it's just within me. I have proven that I can seriously study. last semster I would stay up at my campus' library until closing time everyday, except for the weekends, just working. I would do the same on the weekends, but just at my local public library. My work ethic has been less stellar this semester. At first I blamed it on my sleeplessness, harder honors courses, and more extracurricular responsibilities, but I always knew the truth. Some of my honors classmates were working, while maintaining very high GPA's and taking on more extracurriculars. I attended an honors conferences where undergrads presented research some of which was even published. This made me realize how lazy I am. Over this semester I have ignored my emails and phone, fearing to see a message for a confued advisor or an upset group project member. I would literally just not touch my phone for days on end to avoid reminders of my obligations. I would normally be super stressed, but now I just accepted it? I am foolish because maybe if I throw myself into the next dozen hours I might still walk away with a 3.9, but I am not sure. I know all of the fault lies with me and me alone.

"Is there something wrong with my class or am I just doing a bad job. Post doc here in a pure math department. I taught a few courses and recitations during my PhD and I was a grader for many semesters. I also taught a first year graduate course last semester (on measure theory &amp; integration). Generally speaking I was happy with how they all went and got positive reviews from students/faculty. This semester I am teaching Calc 1 and it's the first time I am fully in charge of a very large (250+ students) course where the majority of the students do not intend on majoring in math. So far it has been very unlike any of my other teaching experiences. Most students don't show up to lecture (less than 25%) and whenever I ask a question I get no response from students. No one shows up to office hours, which is very unusual since from my experience there are always a handful of very motivated students who show up every week or every other week. We've had two exams so far and the average for both of them was way lower than I expected. I even showed the exam to a few senior faculty and they thought it was very reasonable, and if anything, on the easy side. I've also heard some chatter that a few students are unhappy with the course but I haven't heard a reason why. I can't pinpoint if I got unlucky with this group of students or if I'm doing something wrong. I have taught all my courses in a similar manner and they've all went fine. I think the mathematical foundation of the students is very weak which may hinder their ability to follow the lectures, but no one ever asks any questions. I also can see how many students have accessed the lecture notes once I upload them and it's generally less than 10-20%.

"Is college possible as selective mute. ***Edit:*** *I just realized I never mentioned this… I am currently receiving professional help for my mental health.

I went to a high school with staff trained in helping “special needs” kids, so it wasn’t too big of an issue. It was one on one and the patient teachers helped make it a little easier. I want to attend college. I’ve tried multiple times in the past, but ended up dropping classes because of the anxiety. Participation would be a good chunk of the grade and since I couldn’t speak I’d get bad grades, so I would drop them the second teachers tried pressuring me into speaking. Is it possible?

"Need some guidance. I graduated high school in 2020 with 3.64 GPA. I didn't get into any colleges except for a few but I couldn't afford to go ( applied to US during Covid-19). Tried again. Some luck. Got a few good acceptances with some merit scholarships but still wasn't enough for full 4 years. Tried again for a 3rd time. No luck. Put a lot of money (my high-school asks for a very hefty fee which is high key illegal everytime you want your transcripts to be officially sent to universities) and work into my applications but still no luck. I can't do computers science in my home country since you need to have a math in a levels plus other entry exams for which I was too burned out to do and my country's education system is.lacking to say the least. Reluctantly decided to do an online degree at University of London (Coursera). Just got done with first semester and got a first (which is like A and above in UK). I applied to internships (didn't get in to many of them and still waiting on the last remaining one). I also applied to University of Florida online and just heard back today after obsessively checking my portal every day. REJECTED. I have to now pay the fee for the second semester which is starting in April if I want to continue with my education at University of London. I really don't care for it tbh. I find no joy in doing my courses online and the love I had for computer science is mostly gone because of all of this. I am told by my family to stick it out and maybe apply for a summer abroad at UCL or any other university (all out of pocket). Or I could visit my sibling in the US this Summer. Or I can change my major.I always wanted to combine humanities like eng literature, fashion, arts and other stem subject with comp science. Kind of like what brown university's curriculum is. Feeling stuck and lost in life. Any passion or interest i had in CS has gone. I am now wondering if CS or University is for me. I don't know what should I do now. Reapply again for bachelor's? Transfer? But I think most good universities don't accept credits online universities even if it is recognized and accredited institution. I had a lot of dreams and ambitions and life goals mapped out since I was like 13 and they have all gone poof. Every morsel of hope has been squeezed out of my body. I am depressed and I sleep in a lot. My potential is wasted. I so wanted to be independent and free and on my feet but I rarely ever leave the four walls of my bedroom at my parents house.

Pop quizzes are unfair to students with accommodations because they do not allow for scheduling of such accommodations, and even if students are allowed to leave class to take the test/quiz in a separate location, it makes it very awkward for us to be leaving and/or returning to class in front of our peers.

"What can do I about carelessly joining a group that already has the maximum number of allowed students. I'm really bumped and its probably my own fault. I was struggling to find a group to join for one of my assignments so I consulted to my lecturer about this matter. She made a small announcement for any open groups but none came forward. That is until a random group appraoched me saying that I could join them, but they already had 4 members, which was the maximum per group. Despite that, they stated that they discussed it with the lecturer beforehand and she was willing to make the exception for us. With that, I naviely assumed that I could join them without issue. The thought of questioning the validity of these strangers didn't even cross my mind. Needless to say, 2 of the 5 group members were freeloaders that barely contributed to the completion of our assignment. But that was the least of my worries. Last week was presentation week and when it came to be our turn. The lecturer's face turn sour as 5 people instead of the maximum 4 walked to the front. She flipped out and was emotional as she argued with a groupmate of mine. Let's call him Alex. For context, this lecturer has a vendetta against Alex, who is one of the freeloaders mentioned earlier. Though I never really paid attention to their fued so I'm not sure what went on between them. Returning to the arguement, the lecturer insisted that she did not make an exception for our group and that we were supposed to only have the maximum of 4 members as stipulated in the assignment. On the other hand, Alex just kept on saying that she probably forgot and even said that it was her memory failing due to her catching up on age. It eventually ended with the lecturer just saying that she wouldn't be seeing us and started giving everyone the silent treatment. I'm not even sure what I should do, I feel stupid for being so careless and letting this happen. I really do not want to resit the entire subject since its extremely tedious and I actually did my part to complete the coursework.

"Master's by research (MRes) or coursework (MSc). Opening\_Map explained it pretty well, but I just got out of my MRes Viva a couple of hours ago, so thought I'd chime in to build on it. I had a lot of people confused about what the degree actually involved. I mostly explain it as being a kind of ""Apprentice Year (or two)"" of a PhD. I had to design and carry out some studies and produce a 30k thesis at the end. While the university was annoyingly opaque about the actual requirements, my supervisor interpreted the thesis as needing to have about 2-3 (theoretically) publishable articles worth of work in it. I jumped into it with a totally unrelated BA, so it was a bit of a rough learning curve. At the same time, I loved it and feel like it gave a good grounding of what to expect in a PhD. The lack of hand-holding was a bit daunting at times, but being able to dedicate all the time to running around and exploring the Forrest of Knowledge was a great fit for how my brain tends to work. Since you said the MRes you found is 1/3rd coursework, it probably has a different structure to mine. Mine was 100% self directed research and I was expected to check in with my supervisor to review stuff as/when it was needed. They also gave a lot of direction and reading recommendations.

"A credit hour is, generally, one hour of class per week for 15 weeks. When you pay you $150 or whatever for the credit hour, you are paying for the whole 15 weeks or semester.

Some have 14 or 16 week semesters, depending on how they count exam weeks or breaks. Some may also have shorter 8-week semesters where you are in classes for two hours per week for each credit hour. A full-time course load is normally, anything over 12 credits, but realistically, you need 15 credits per semester to graduate on time. If you are looking at a Bachelor's degree, they are generally 120 credits. 15 credits times two semesters (fall and spring) per year for four years equals 120. 15 X 2 = 30. 30 X 4 = 120.

"PE and cold during my finals. Hello everyone, Nine months ago, I was diagnosed with unprovoked pulmonary embolism (PE). Since then, I’ve been taking Eliquis (5 mg twice a day).

"Being Bullied in College. Sounds really dumb to say but it’s literally whats happening. I am currently dealing with “Social Bullying” that has gotten so bad I’ve lost 2 of my best friends (both relationships over 4+ yrs) because of it. The group in question I was friends with until one of the friends started treating me and my family like dirt, going as far as calling my disabled mother the “crazy lady” for buying them all food. I told the group I was uncomfortable and left the friend group, but still wanted to stay friends with the majority of the group…which didn’t happen. I’ve caught them spreading rumors/talking shit about me 8 separate times. I’ve had to be moved into a separate single dorm, change my classes, etc just to try to have peace. Now my friends all hate me because of these rumors, despite me proving them false time and time again. These ex-friends are unfortunately the “popular kid” group and are friends with everyone on campus, so anytime I try to make friends its always either a look of disgust or they act overly friendly then report anything “off” to the group. (I say “off” bc they villainize everything I say at this point) I am completely alone and I can’t even go to class without being in fear. My school thinks the only form of harassment is sexual so there’s nothing I can report, either. I only have support from friends online/my mom. Luckily this year is almost over, but does anyone have advice for the upcoming year? TLDR: Ex-Friends are popular and have been spreading nasty rumors about me to the point where Ive been ostracized.

"Learning how to ask questions is a good skill for any career path. Some basic principles: - Asking someone to use their expertise to create a personalized answer for you is *asking for a favor*. Doing this thoughtlessly or without putting in any work on your side is rude and entitled - Asserting that you've put in work is both not compelling and not the point; include all the information that you have in your question to demonstrate that work - Including more information in your question will get you better answers (ex: 'What's 2 + 2?' will mostly get mockery and at best an answer of '4'. 'I'm in a number theory class and trying to apply the axioms and definitions to calculate 2 + 2 but I'm getting stuck, are there any particular definitions I should focus on?' will get more on-topic responses). To use your question as an example, you originally didn't say anything about personal experiences - if that's what you were looking for, it should be in the original question. Similarly, you haven't (in the original, the edit, or the replies) included any information about what you searched for or why you have follow up questions ('I see some schools require the GRE, but others don't - did you find it helpful to take the GRE, and would you recommend that I do so?' is a much better question than 'Is there a test to become a professor?' - the latter will get plenty of 'no' answers because there isn't an equivalent of the CPA exam or bar exam to be a professor, and folks may not realize you're talking about grad school).

"Nightmare roommate. My daughter started college this Fall and is living in a ""double"" room in the freshman dorms. Her roommate, who was a random assignment, seems to have serious mental issues and has told my daughter about her tendency toward violence with her younger sibling. (She apparently has broken her bones.) Over the past month, the roommate's bad behavior has increased from constant insults and controlling behavior, to angry screaming and berating, to intentional sleep deprivation, and now shoving and slapping. My daughter refuses to engage with the aggression and always walks away. She is terrified of this young lady, and has been sleeping on couches in other people's rooms for the past 5 days. I flew in today from out of state to meet with the housing director for my daughter's dorm building, but her stance is that shoving ""isn't *really* assault."" She offered for my daughter to move out of the building (where she has already made all her new friends) to a very run down building my daughter would rather not live in. (There are no rooms available in my daughter's current building.) My thoughts are that my daughter has the right to remain in her room without being harassed and assaulted by an angry unhinged roommate. I feel that the university should tell the roommate that her bad behavior must stop or SHE will be moved out. The housing director (for my daughter's building) said that the student conduct code isn't completely straightforward, and she'll look into it but she doesn't know if any of this behavior falls into a category that would enable the school to act against the roommate. It seems ridiculous to me that putting your hands on another person would ever be considered acceptable, but she is treating it like it's just kids being kids. Is there anything I can do? *Update: Thank you to everyone for the great advice! My daughter filed a report with the campus police, and officers went to student housing to talk to them. Additionally, I wrote an email to the Dean of students to advise him of the situation. The following day, student housing contacted my daughter to let her know that the roommate is being immediately moved to a different building.

"Do F's on transcript affect admissions. 21M here, thinking of applying to grad school abroad when I graduate in around 2 years. context: I'm in a third world country, so grad school is pretty much the safest ticket outta here, plus grad schools here pretty much suck. I'm enrolled in a Bachelors programme for electrical engineering, with plans to pursue a masters in a computer science related field, I'm thinking cyber security or AI. What I wanted to ask, is how important are transcripts? Due to mental health issues and starting a business, I really neglected my studies and have a lot of F's on my transcript due to a lack of attendance (Think: 10+ above), I've tried to reason with the administration to get those F's removed as they were due to my ineligibility to attend the exams because of attendance, not because of actual failures, but to no avail. Usually this would mean a death sentence for any opportunities, but some of my friends who have taken multiple repeat courses and have a comparatively lower gpa (2.6-2.8) have gotten into masters programmes in the UK.

"Gratitude, Success &amp; Why I Loved My first Year at College. From the beginning, I knew I was going into college prepared. The fact of the matter is that I just knew what I was going to do, I knew why and the only fuzzy part of my plan was how. But after being a social devil in my hall, getting to meet everyone by their first name in my entire hall, I just feel so excited to come back again. I had my doubts about further education when I was in high school, because I had felt so left behind and abandoned by my teachers, who wouldn't have the time nor the patience to help me when I lacked behind in fundamental aspects of the class or didn't know how to do something, ""You're teacher last year should have taught you this"". But college is NOTHING like that for me! I went into office hours with every professor I have failed, I became more active than I ever have in my life beforehand (We have a large campus, but still very walkable), and made a commitment to the Gym that students can use for free, lost weight and my breathing health issues have virtually disappeared. My mind is clear, and even if the food in the dining hall sucks, it's outweighed by the tremendous happiness I feel to have finished off this year, with not a single class under 95%. I understand that the coming years, that 95% isn't going to be staying around long, since this year was mostly introductory classes and gen-eds, but I welcome the challenge. The feeling of failing classes, only to put EVERYTHING I had into it to bring it back up was the most exhilarating challenge of my life, and it took everything in me, that I couldn't have done it without the help of wonderful professors and a supportive friend group of like-minded individuals on campus. I used to hate trigonometry, because in high school if you did not understand it, then you were left behind. And it built ontop of itself, every unit used the last in some way-shape-form, and I nearly failed it in high school. But in College, I'm rocking around a 98! The expectations I had for college were minimal, I thought I was going to lock myself up in my room, ignore my roommate and just get my shitty piece of paper in 4 years, and pursue my 'actual' life. But in college, I failed to see that this IS STILL MY LIFE. I am euphoric, absolutely zooted, with about 20 new contacts in my phone and a group of lifelong friends that want to live with me after college, I couldn't have asked for a better first year of college. It wasn't without it's hardships, like I said I was near failing in 2-3 of my classes midway through one of the semesters because I fell ill and couldn't make it to class, and with no pre-recorded lectures I was at the mercy of my illness, back and fourth from the clinic almost daily at some intervals of the worst parts of the sickness. But Teaching Assistants are a blessing that we do not deserve, they helped me get things together, with extra credit, making up missing labs and assignments, and so much time in office hours, I sprang back! The separation from my folks, the independence, the social interactions, the housing situation, the roommates and the fights, the theft and threats and dancing, the parties and the 4AM library study sessions, the night walks to sandwich shops open until 3AM, the exploring campus buildings after hours with flashlights, the food poisoning from undercooked chicken in the dining hall, the missing the shuttle bus, the injuries I collected in the gym, dealing with the guys who aren't all there who ruined my mood, dealing with the lack of cash everywhere and all the time, and just how painfully I missed going fishing! I'd do it all again! I'd do it a thousand more times! I love college and I hope everyone finished this year off good, and if not, just make sure next year you do everything you wanna do!

I will try my best to describe what is going on but I am not an expert in servers and Linux so my explanation might not be adequate. 1. Similar things happened in June-July 2021. High memory usage was detected when I kept Putty on to access the server and kept it open. I didn't shut down the server access because I was coding and building deep learning models using Jupyter Notebook. While this time the memory usage wasn't high, but constantly some processes were operated under my ID. I don't know why. 2. There were some commands (history) which I don't even know what they are about (it happened in July 2021). But because they are in the command history of my linux terminal I have no ways to prove that I'm not the one who used the commands. 3. The student in my lab who is mainly in charge of the servers found a cryptocurrency wallet linked somewhere on my computer. I don't know the wallet ID (or whatever the name of the wallet is called). Is there a way to know who the owner of the wallet is? 4. According to the lab manager, there has been suspicious activities before and after the day of my thesis defense. He thinks that I mined coins, temporarily stopped when I'm busy preparing for my defense, and then resumed the process. Also, he says that if my computer was hacked then the hackers would get everything done and disconnect but in my case it happened before and after my busy days. The thing is, I have never mined coins before and I don't even know how it works. I know that high spec GPUs are used commonly to mine coins like Bitcoins or Ethereums, but I don't even know how the mechanism works. But I don't know what to do to prove that I didn't mine coins. I can't open my head and show that I'm innocent. I know people here would also be skeptical. I don't know what to do except to hold my ground and say I didn't do anything. Hell, if I really did mine coins then at least I would get the benefit of having more money to spend. However, I don't want to be penalized or punished for something I haven't done. I get enough funding to pay for tuition, dorm, and stuff I need and I'm very lucky to have my parents who can support me financially if I need anything extra in my daily life, so I have no reason to risk it. Also, people were already questioning me last year so why would I do something stupid and use the server to mine coins? I might have to see my PI for this issue (maybe tomorrow) and I heard that my PI would require me to leave the lab and start working earlier than previously planned for this. I just don't hope he thinks I did it and revoke my degree (he has the power to do so within a year after the thesis defense) If you have any advice or something, please let me know. Thank you for reading. Edit: Thank you all so much for your kind comments and advice. I didn't want to flood your notifications so I thought it was best to edit the post. I also posted a comment with the same stuff. I talked to the lab manager tonight (at about 10:30pm; fyi I'm not in the US). He admits that he is still pretty skeptical of me but other people in the lab said that because I downloaded a lot of different code from other websites like Github the problem could have started from here. He does think that is a possibility and did not realize it at the top of his head the first time. He had a chance to talk to the PI (went to see the PI for other reasons and I guess he talked about this incident while he was at his office) and he did defend me using that logic and fortunately things didn't escalate. I am planning to talk to the server guy this morning /afternoon. I want to ask the things you guys pointed out and suggested that I find out. My server container (virtual environment) was scheduled to be shut down and deleted (to prevent more damage) after I back up my files, but if it is not deleted yet I think I can ask him to either help or at least maintain the virtual environment for me to look for evidence lime timestamps and IDs. The server guy didn't say much but said ""next time be careful what you download from online, yeah?"" Not sure whether he is just trying not to accuse me and be nice as possible not to make things awkward. Just wanted to clarify some things here; I'm sorry for the misunderstandings caused by my poor explanation. 1. The lab manager is not really playing detective per se but he is the one to talk to me as he is in a leadership position. I guess he didn't want to make things awkward between the server guy and me by making the guy confront me directly. This issue happened to me twice while no one else experienced it so I guess that's why he was more skeptical. 2. I did try to argue back that I am financially stable (relatively) and I had no reasons to do so. Like how it's dumb to use the lab's server to mine coins when I was already a suspect last year. Also, like how someone mentioned that coins are not that lucrative rn I did use that argument. But that time he said that listing reasons why I wouldn't mine coins does not completely prove my innocence and also that in July 2021 coins were profitable. 3. About leaving the lab early: I misunderstood the intensions as the main reason was because it was better to leave early if I didn't have anything to do to contribute to the lab. It was mentioned while talking about cryptocurrency so I thought the main reason was because of this incident. Idk how funding is given out in the US, but in Korea we are paid per month (it's like a salary). My PI was not that happy about graduating students staying in the lab until the start of the next semester while not doing anything productive. To elaborate, we officially graduate in February. The thesis defense is in December and therefore in January and February we have more time to spend. The PI was not happy that some students stayed for two months and gets paid while doing nothing for two months. Therefore I have a choice of either writing and submitting paperwork and reports for a patent or go back home and not get paid without further responsibilities",Hostel,Medium,1.0,web:reddit:r/gradschool:search:exam schedule problem,Medium,1,7123,1347,9,People in my lab think I'm mining (crypto)coins using the lab's server.,0

"My roommate is a jerk and obnoxious. I'm looking for an opinion on this, I guess. So I'm a US student in the UK -- not the best choice, but here we are. I'm room with eight other people in a flat and the person to my left is complete jerk wade. He knocks on the wall, smacks into it, plays extremely loud music, talks on his phone at the same volume late at night, and slams his door early in the morning when leaving. I've asked him to stop, but instead of, you know, being kind, he does it on purpose now. I have asked the housing company to address the issue, but they've ignored the email. It's understandable to bump into the wall and hear everyday life noises, but is it cultural to respect others around you and only make phone calls between 9 am - 8/9 pm? I tolerated this during the fall and spring terms; students only sometimes have the chance to chat late into the evening or at night. However, we're in the summer term now; studying for exams and writing a dissertation means most students will be in the dorms working on stuff. But because of my neighbor, it's become extremely difficult to focus. I've tried to go on campus but it's equally as loud, and the library is uncomfortable. Is it normal for guys to be this disrespectful? It resembles toddler behavior! I've shared dorms with males before; they were loud at times but would respectfully acknowledge that they were disrupting others and lower the volume. I should have prefaced; I'm respectful towards everyone I'm sharing the flat with. Keeping the music volume down or using headphones, avoiding hitting the wall -- there's no reason I should be brushing against it in the first place, closing my door softly when I leave, and (now) only talking to family until 6 pm. I'm at a loss here. I honestly can't wrap my head around why someone would be so disrespectful in a shared living space. The flat had an issue with a guy earlier in the year who was stealing food and constantly slamming his door -- he was kicked out, but now there's this guy. No one else in the flat acts like this; we're all quiet and respectful of each other. We're all post-graduates, by the way; I'm the second youngest being in my early twenties.

"What is the best ai essay writer for next 2026 year. Mainly looking for AI tools for essays + citations — what actually works? My main use case is essay writing and citation formatting. I’m not expecting miracles, and I know no tool can guarantee it won’t get flagged by detectors. Current workflow: * Writing / ideas: ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini * Paraphrasing / cleanup: Grammarly, QuillBot, NoteGPT AI Essay Writer The issue is that Grammarly edits get flagged a lot (especially by Copyleaks), even when the original writing is mine, which is pretty frustrating. Honestly, I don’t think there’s a single “best AI tool” for 2026. Most big models write fine, but none are great at citations, tone, and detection all at once. What’s been working better for me: * Writing most of the essay myself * Using AI only for small edits, structure, or clarity * Not letting one tool generate the whole essay This mixed approach feels more natural and seems to get flagged less. For final polish, I sometimes run *my own writing* through a light AI humanizer just to remove stiffness — not to rewrite everything.

"Student got 100% on exam and isn't even enrolled in school. I recently was grading the first exam for my class. I'm teaching two sections of the same class and I told students they could attend either lecture, but they can only come to take the exams in the section where they are registered. I graded the exams for my Wednesday section and I had an extra one. The student got 100%. I assumed he was one of my Friday students, so I put the exam in the pile with my Friday class and was going to work on it the next day. I get all my Friday exams graded and entered in Blackboard and there was still this extra one. I doublechecked both sections and this kid wasn't listed. I Googled the student to see who he was and saw a pic online and recognized him. He didn't come to every lecture, but he did come to class, and he was the one who took the exam. I was totally confused and thought there was a problem with my Blackboard class list. I went to the Registrar the next day and handed the test to them and asked if they could help me figure out what's going on. They looked up his student ID and told me he wasn't enrolled in school. My response was simply WTF? They said they couldn't tell me the exact situation, but they often have kids screenshot their schedule in December, not read their emails, and get unenrolled in school before the semester starts. Unenrolled for various reasons, the most common are unpaid tuition and fees or fighting on campus, so he got kicked out of school and never read the email.

"Times Up"" means turn in your exam, not ""take several minutes now to fill out the scantron"". Feeling frustrated. I tell my students in my giant classes that they must complete their exam in the time allotted. Once time is up, they must hand in their exam as is. Once I leave the room, I will not accept exams. On my last exam, several students came up to the front several minutes past ""times up"" (the fourth ""times up"" announcement, that is) saying they just needed to fill out their scantron. No. Times up. It is not fair to the students who included the scantron in their allotted time to allow additional time to complete the exam. So, I made them turn it in as is. Well, they didn't like that. One complained to the chair and he strong-armed me into filling out scantrons FOR them. Am I being crazy? In my opinion, it is all about fairness. If I let some students have 4-5 extra minutes to fill out their scantron, then I must allow all 400 of them to do so. I am strict about the conclusion of the exam in the interest of fairness. I know I am not the only one who does this, because even the accommodations center took an exam from a student who hadn't filled out their scantron because time was up. And yet, I have to do whatever the students decide is appropriate for the end of the exam because my chair doesn't want anyone upset. I know this might sound minor, but how much extra time do I have to give them? What if another student needs 10 extra minutes to fill it out?

"What to do about the student who is literally offended by everything. Hi everyone. 35M prof here. I’ve had to deal with something that probably other people have at some point but not me until this semester. I am so sick of the student(s) that literally get offended by anything and everything. I’ve had 2 this semester so far, well, down to one. I emailed a student who’d missed four consecutive classes to see if everything was ok. She responded with a really, really nasty email accusing me of talking about her to other students (I have a small class and attendance, and when I got to her name, I asked if anyone had heard from her, which I wouldn’t deem inappropriate) and saying offensive things and that she is talking with her counselor figuring out how to deal with the trauma I caused her before coming back. This is the literal first time I’ve ever heard this from a student and also I make it clear that anyone who has an issue feel free to come talk to me to resolve it, and if we can’t, THEN go to a higher-up/someone else. I did not respond and fwded the email to her academic advisor, along with saying that she is no longer welcome in my class, especially if she is going to talk like that to other students. Also talked to academic advisor in person, who agreed, and told her that she needs to drop my class. Second student is one who has come to me multiple times after class including today, to complain about things I say, do, everything offends her. I always apologize bc why not, but it’s starting to get to me and I do not know what exactly she wants from me. Example: the topic in class was parenting styles, and I shared that the week before, I had seen a very small child playing alone in the street while driving. I drove around to block to see if there was an adult looking for a lost kid, and then came back, stopped my car, and casually walked toward the kid with the intention of either asking if he was lost bc I knew that if I didn’t stop and something happened to that kid, I’d never forgive myself. But as I walked up to the kid, a person appeared out of nowhere - turns out the kid’s mom was there the whole time, sitting and reading nearby, but wearing an oversized brown hoodie over a matching long brown dress, both the exact brown color of the tree trunk she was sitting against, completely camouflaged without knowing.

I have just reported him today (yesterday during the day) because I had tried to study / finish my assignments before doing the report (as the report takes energy to write and revisit all the screenshots+proof). My logic says the uni should partly be responsible for the damage done to a student by a professor, so they should support me in minimizing the effect it has on my life and academic life. This is not a privafte matter or my fault. This is more like a workplace accident or 'illness' from the wrokplace, so they cannto expect the same rubrics or grades from me. Idk waht I can do or what they can do for me. And I am feeling a bit dramatic to ask. I have sent an e-mail to my therapist but she is on vacation until after examination season. I'm afraid by then it would be too late for any interference from the health center. Any tips? ANY tips? I don't want to text my professors claiming I have been harassed because I only did the report yesterday so I would rather wait for authorities to confirm before this goes out to public knowledge",Academic,High,2.0,reddit:r/college,High,2,2195,415,0,How can university help me after being harassed by a professor and it's affecting my grades.,0

"Bizarre recommendation form for former student. I just filled out a recommendation form that was absolutely idiotic. It had a bunch of likert-style questions, no spots for individual feedback and then at the end I had to pick a famous person as who I saw the student becoming in 10 years. They had controversial options like Elon Musk and Mother Theresa. I don’t know if they mean the person we thought Mother Theresa was 20 years ago, or the person we found out she was after her death. I just wanted to give a good recommendation letter, not deal with stupid questions. I then had to agree to terms and conditions but they obviously hadn’t modified the terms from what they show the students because I had to agree to my student financial aid data being released. I didn’t give them my real first name, I gave them my nickname that’s in my email, so they wouldn’t have enough info on me to look that up, but I’m tempted to write a complaint to them that that’s incredibly unprofessional on their end but maybe do it in 6 months after they make their decisions",Faculty,Low,0.0,web:pullpush:r/Professors:submission:complaint,Low,0,1061,194,6,Bizarre recommendation form for former student.,0
"Thinking about returning to school after 8 years…. I’ve always had graduate school in the back of my mind. I did well in undergrad — 3.96 GPA overall and a 4.0 in my major. Got some scholarships and did some extracurriculars. But no internships or externships. Instead I traveled, studied abroad, and dealt with very serious medical issues. When I finished college, I was still very much learning to live with the aftermath of medical trauma and changes in my life. I struggled but got a job at Target in my hometown. Then I worked in hostels in Europe the year after that. Then I returned to Target, moved across the country, started work in higher education, moved across the country again and just started a career in graduate medical education. My new job has wonderful benefits, one of them being tuition reimbursement of up to 15k/yr. Every one else on my team has some sort of advanced degree, and I really enjoyed college/academia, and thinking about pursuing a masters is exciting to me. The first thing I’ve ever excited by in too long of a time. I’m looking at online health communication masters programs. It would make sense for my current career, and I have a real interest in the content/subject since I’ve been a patient so much in my life. How was your experience applying to graduate schools after so many years out of college? I’m worried about that and my lack of academic/research background. I know I can get 1-2 good academic recommendations from professors - does it matter that they taught me 8-10 years ago? Sorry for being so long winded.

"Sharing Ideas with a Research Lab and Leaving Because of Unresponsiveness. Hello all, There is an AI research lab at my university (USA) that I wanted to be involved in. I contacted the professor and he added 2 people (from his lab) to our conversations and recommended that I work with them. One of those 2 people (a postdoc) asked me to share my research ideas. I wrote my ideas to paper in detail—how they could be implemented, what kinds of problems they would solve, why they are promising etc.—and shared those documents with those 2 people via [Box.com](http://Box.com) over 2 weeks ago. However, they still have not responded. Since the beginning of this process, they have always been unresponsive. That's why I no longer want to work with them.

"Analyzing Cruz's NSF ""Woke DEI"" Grants Dataset Using Gemini API. **Abstract**: Senator Ted Cruz's claimed that $2 billion in NSF funding was directed toward woke DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) initiatives. In response, this report utilized Google Gemini API to systematically classify and analyze the flagged research projects, ranking them on a 1-to-5 scale based on their actual alignment with neutral scientific and national security priorities versus social justice themes. The results showed that the majority of flagged projects had no explicit relationship to DEI goals. Only one grant, a PhD dissertation of less than $15,000, explicitly studied misgendering. Additionally, 43 projects were incorrectly flagged solely for using keyword terms like ""equality"" and ""bias"" in a mathematical or statistical context rather than in relation to DEI themes. The largest category (Rank 2, \~40% of funding ($800 million) or 1,426 grants) primarily focused on scientific research, such as wildfires, water shortages, and renewable energy with minimal alignment beyond diversity outreach. The rest of the projects ranked 3, 4, and 5, mostly focused on recruiting and retaining students and researchers from underrepresented areas. These findings suggest that broad keyword-based filtering may misclassify research, capturing technical fields unrelated to social activism. The vast majority of NSF-funded projects remain focused on STEM advancement and student recruitment, rather than promoting radical ideological agendas. **Methodology** This report uses Google's Gemini API to rank the dataset provided by Senator Cruz based on the column ""AWARD DESCRIPTION."" The ranking system categorizes each research grant from 1 to 5, depending on its alignment with specific criteria. The classification process was carried out using a custom Python script that submitted each award description to the Gemini API, instructing it to assign a numerical rank along with a brief explanation based on predefined ideological criteria. Grants ranked 1 or 2 were determined to have minimal or no alignment with DEI-related themes, while rank 3 captured projects with moderate or indirect references to DEI-related language. Grants ranked 4 or 5 were those explicitly focused on social justice, diversity, inclusion, or related topics. To ensure transparency and reproducibility, all code and data used in this analysis are available in a public GitHub repository. The repository includes the full dataset with rankings and reasoning, the complete Python script used for processing the data via the Gemini API, and instructions for replicating the ranking process with different criteria if desired. This provides an opportunity for independent verification of the methodology and results, allowing for further refinement and analysis. The full repository can be accessed here: [GitHub Link](https://github.com/loveconomics/Cruz/). As a robustness check, 50 randomly selected data points were reprocessed through the Gemini API to assess the consistency of the ranking system. Of these, 48 retained their original rank, while one increased by a rank and another decreased by a rank. This suggests a high level of stability in the classification process. Additional robustness checks can be conducted using alternative language models if further validation is required. **Results** The ranking process assigned each project a score from 1 to 5, reflecting its alignment with the specified criteria. The majority of projects fell into Rank 2 and Rank 4, indicating a wide distribution of funding across different research themes. Rank 1, representing projects with minimal alignment to DEI-related topics, contained only 43 projects, accounting for $13,989,927 or 0.68% of the total funding reported. Rank 2, the largest category, included 1,426 projects, receiving $799,973,095 or 38.86% of the total funding reported. Rank 3, representing projects with moderate alignment, contained 202 projects with $141,510,541 in funding reported, comprising 6.87% of the total. Rank 4, capturing research that showed strong but not dominant DEI alignment, included 1,030 projects with $658,845,558 in funding reported, or 32.00% of the total. Rank 5, which represented projects explicitly focused on social justice and DEI themes, contained 782 projects receiving $444,398,794, or 21.59% of the funding reported. The institutions receiving the most grants in the database were led by the State of California Controllers Office, which accounted for 113 projects, followed by the University of Texas System (94) and the Board of Governors of the State University System of Florida (82). Other major recipients included the University of North Carolina (60), the University of Colorado (55), the University of Michigan (52), and Purdue University (45). In terms of total funding, the University of Illinois received the largest amount at $65,969,694, followed closely by the State of California Controllers Office ($62,628,160) and the University of Texas System ($55,364,074). Other top-funded institutions included Arizona State University ($48,807,561), the State University of New York Research Foundation ($41,854,782), and the University of Michigan ($30,127,858). **Examples of Grants Based on Grants** **Rank 1: 43 grants, \~$13 million** Grants classified under Rank 1 were flagged due to keyword matches rather than actual DEI content, leading to the scrutiny and misclassification of scientific and mathematical research projects with no social or political focus. A mosquito research grant ($1,000,000) was incorrectly flagged for using ""underrepresented attributes"" in the context of AI training biases rather than DEI. A mathematical research project on log-concave functions ($156,000) was flagged simply for using ""equality"" and ""inequality"" in a technical sense, and a statistical research grant ($75,000) was misclassified for using ""biased"" and ""unbiased"" in an inference context. These examples highlight how keyword-based filtering without contextual understanding resulted in the misclassification, demonstrating the flaws in broad, automated categorization methods. **Rank 2: 1,426 grants, \~$800 million** Grants classified under Rank 2 were primarily focused on scientific research, such as wildfires, water shortages, and renewable energy, with only minimal alignment to DEI beyond diversity outreach. A water shortage study in the Southwest was flagged despite its focus on climate change, infrastructure, and resource management, as it included references to underrepresented communities affected by water scarcity. The American National Election Studies (ANES) grant, which has long been considered the gold standard for nonpartisan election research, was categorized under this rank because it examined misinformation, political polarization, and threats to electoral legitimacy, topics that, while essential to democracy studies, were flagged due to language that overlapped with DEI themes. Similarly, a Data Science Symposium at South Dakota State University was classified under Rank 2 because it aimed to increase participation from students in rural and underserved areas, even though its primary focus was on mathematics, statistics, and computational science. These projects were not explicitly DEI-driven but were grouped under Rank 2 due to incidental references to outreach and inclusion efforts. **Rank 3: 202 grants, \~$140 million** Grants classified under Rank 3 were primarily focused on scientific and technological advancements but contained a moderate alignment with DEI themes, typically through outreach or workforce diversity initiatives. A project studying gravitational waves and dark matter was flagged under this category due to its references to training students from underrepresented backgrounds, despite its primary focus on theoretical physics and cosmology. Similarly, the CORE National Ecosystem for Cyberinfrastructure (CONECT), which aims to advance cybersecurity, data networking, and cyberinfrastructure integration, was categorized under Rank 3 because it included a workforce development initiative aimed at recruiting students from underrepresented groups. While both projects are centered on advancing knowledge in fundamental physics and computing, their explicit inclusion of diversity-focused training programs led to their classification as having moderate DEI alignment. **Rank 4: 1,030 grants, \~$660 million** Grants classified under Rank 4 were primarily focused on broadening participation in STEM fields and increasing diversity in scientific disciplines, making diversity, equity, and inclusion a central goal rather than an incidental component. A grant supporting student travel to the 2022 Physics Congress (PhysCon) was categorized under this rank because it specifically funded attendance for students from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs), aiming to address racial disparities in physics degrees. Similarly, a program designed to increase STEM retention and graduation rates for low-income and underrepresented students was classified under Rank 4 due to its explicit focus on mentorship, early research experiences, and addressing systemic barriers in STEM education. While these projects involve STEM fields, their primary mission was to increase representation, equity, and access in science and technology, leading to their classification as having a strong DEI focus. **Rank 5: 782 grants, \~$444 million** Grants classified under Rank 5 were primarily focused on rethinking institutional practices and social structures through a DEI lens. A project in Maryland aimed to address the teacher shortage in high-need schools by recruiting and preparing culturally responsive STEM teachers, with a particular emphasis on increasing diversity in the teaching workforce. Another project sought to understand how Black girls develop an interest in STEM by incorporating their lived experiences into science education, aiming to reduce barriers to participation. A research initiative in AI and language processing focused on developing machine learning tools to detect implicit social bias in online discourse, with the goal of mitigating discrimination and fostering inclusivity in digital spaces. While these projects contained academic and technological components, their central objectives were to reshape education, mentorship, and digital engagement through frameworks emphasizing identity, representation, and equity. **Additional Results** A total of 128 grants were designated for REU Sites (Research Experience for Undergraduates), amounting to approximately $50 million. Additionally, 349 grants, totaling $200 million, focused on various aspects of Machine Learning and AI, while $23 million was allocated to Small Business Research Development. Among 55 grants awarded for PhD dissertations, only one explicitly addressed misgendering, with funding of less than $15,000. Funding related to indigenous communities totaled $128 million. Furthermore, 736 grants included the word ""women,"" 485 referenced ""minorities,"" 345 mentioned ""gender,"" 190 cited ""indigenous,"" and 100 specifically referenced ""African Americans."" **Conclusion** The findings of this report indicate that while a subset of NSF-funded research explicitly focuses on diversity, equity, and inclusion, the vast majority of grants are centered on scientific, technological, and educational advancement. The use of keyword-based classification led to the scrutiny of numerous projects that had little or no connection to DEI beyond incidental mentions of terms such as ""bias"" and ""equality"" in mathematical or scientific contexts. Projects categorized under Rank 1 and Rank 2, which together accounted for nearly half of the funding examined, primarily focused on STEM research and national challenges such as climate change, cybersecurity, and infrastructure, with only minimal DEI alignment. Rank 3 grants often combined scientific inquiry with outreach to underrepresented communities, while Rank 4 projects emphasized increasing participation in STEM among historically excluded groups. Rank 5, comprising 21.59% of the funding, included grants where DEI principles were a central objective, often focusing on systemic changes in education, mentorship, and institutional practices. This analysis underscores the limitations of broad categorization methods that rely on keyword filtering rather than a nuanced evaluation of research intent. While DEI initiatives are a component of NSF funding, particularly in efforts to expand access to STEM education, the data does not support the claim that $2 billion is solely dedicated to ""woke"" agendas. Instead, the findings suggest that the vast majority of NSF-funded research remains grounded in scientific and technological progress, with DEI efforts often serving as a supporting, rather than a primary, objective",Attendance,High,2.0,web:pullpush:r/Professors:submission:attendance,High,2,12960,1832,2,"Analyzing Cruz's NSF ""Woke DEI"" Grants Dataset Using Gemini API.",0

"First time posting here, and am in a bit of a pickle. Hi everyone, So I am sadly in a really tricky situation. It goes as follows. This fall semester could be my last at a community college and I would have an associates degree, and I would be transferring to a 4 year college in the area. The 4 year college has a special transfer scholarship for those who transfer after receiving an associates degree. The scholarship is based on transfer GPA. There are 3 levels of the scholarship, a $500/semester, a $1200/semester level, and a $2500/semester level which I dont qualify for. The problem is that I am a part time student, so I have spent more time at this community college then most have spent in their entire undergrad education, but in return, I am debt free. For the $1200/semester award, the minimum GPA to qualify is a 3.5, however, I am at a 3.488 due to a couple of bad classes. Part of me wants to cancel my graduation application at the CC and take one more semester to raise that GPA above 3.5 so I can get the bigger award, and would be a big help in me staying debt free, but that would cost me another semester when I have already spent so much time there already. If I transfer now, i'd only get the $500/semester award. For reference, the cost to attend this 4 year college is about $180/credit, and requires me to take a minimum of 12 credits to use the scholarship. I need some advice, what would you do in my situation? Would you delay transferring a semester and retake a class to improve the GPA and get the bigger award? Or bite the bullet and transfer now, but not get nearly as much money, and thus would be more expensive to attend? This has been really stressing me out, so any insights would be appreciated.

"(TA advice) What is the best way to deal with students who unfairly complain about their grade. This is probably more pertinent for humanities TAs (due to the subjective nature of grading), but does anyone have any experience navigating student grade complaints? I've always graded using rubrics, in an attempt to quantify and standardize a process that is traditionally very subjective. I don't like having to give poor grades, I want my students to succeed and I feel that I give them every opportunity to do so. I implore students to come to my office hours to talk about assignments, I read over papers before they are due so as to offer advice on improving grades, and I always give copious feedback to let students know how to improve on the next assignment. I'm aware of how frustrating humanities classes can be in this regard, where they are no ""right"" answers, and good grades are based on difficult to quantify rubrics such as writing ability, logical consistency, and critical analysis of sources. As a result I feel that humanities TAs are far more susceptible to bullying, grade grubbing and grade complaints. In previous semesters I always felt that the professor had my back, that if a student complained (and the complaint was unfair, which generally it is considering how much time and effort I put into giving adequate feedback), I could direct them to the professor. However, the professor I'm currently working with has made it clear that she refuses to ""be the bad guy"", suggesting that she will not have our backs in this regard. She also made it clear that she wants us to hold students to a very high standard when grading. Following the first assignment, I've already received one very nasty complaint from a student claiming that I ""cheated him"" on his grade. He was unable to provide any evidence of this, and considering that I wrote a paragraph of useful feedback after every answer on his assignment, I feel that his claim is very unfair. As I can't rely on the professor to support me, do any TAs here have any advice? It's causing me a lot of anxiety, and I'm becoming afraid to go to class tomorrow to face him. **TL:DR: What is the best way to deal with student grade complaints?** *Edit: I didn't get a chance to reply to everyone, but I just want to say a general thank you to all the people that responded to this thread.

"Partner left academia and we suspect that her old supervisor is trying to ruin her career. So we're in a bit of a pickle here. My partner recently left her PhD program due to mental health among other reasons. We're both sober and academia was having a negative impact on her sobriety, as her research group was insistent on her drinking at each social event, even when she declined. She also felt very left out, and her supervisor clearly was unfair to her and treated her with open disrespect. Some examples (according to her): - He would laugh at her during her seminars, bomb her with questions that she was unable to answer and criticize her to the point where every time she came home from holding a seminar, she would be in tears. - Leave her out of group discussions and shut the door in front of her. - Change the language to the local language from English when my partner tried to join a conversation (she does not speak the local language). The group was also ridiculing her as she was lacking knowledge of this language, knowing full well she's a foreigner. - Leave her name out of papers she contributed to. - Randomly pulled her aside last year to tell her that she's not going to graduate with no warning signs. She published 3 papers during her PhD, which is a lot for her very theoretical field, but this was not enough in the eyes of her advisor. - Saw that she was struggling a lot, but never offered help even when she asked. Just told her to ""deal with it like an adult"". - Humiliated her multiple times in front of other people, calling her all sorts of names (""stupid"", ""idiot"" etc) Perhaps it's fair to say that me and my partner also went through a lot together, and I put her through some tough times as well. Earlier this year she figured that enough is enough and left. She got a part time job as an English and math teacher, and began working on her own educational company. I am very proud of her. She is self-employed, and although it's not as prestigious of a career choice in her eyes, she is much happier with her life. A lot of her clients are educational publishers, educational technology, and more. Recently though, a few of these clients have pulled back without saying anything and essentially ghosting her. I should mention that she is very open about her work on social media and actively uses platforms like LinkedIn. We did not think anything about this. I work on a freelance basis as well, and sometimes clients just ghost. It was not until recently that one client asked her during a meeting if she had ever worked with her supervisor X. Apparently, her client was contacted by someone in the old research group of X (presumably X himself, we do not know for sure), telling them that she is a neglectful employee who has lied about her qualifications (she has not, she openly talks about being an academia dropout, and only lists her master's degree in her CV as far as I know), and should not be given any projects or money. This person also brought up her alcohol problem to the client, even though my girlfriend told her supervisor about it in complete confidence, after which he still encouraged her to drink. Worst of all, the client apparently said that this person that contacted them has let them know that my girlfriend is actively neglecting her taxes, and is encouraging a potential investigation. Moreover, someone she is on decent terms with in her old research group recently also reached out to her. They let her know that her old supervisor is STILL shitting on her for dropping out and making fun of her new career. He also ridicules her for her new career, making claims how it is never going to work out, etc. She also has a few researchers she worked with in the past reaching out to her, asking if everything is okay as her supervisor is making very bold claims, and it's making people generally a bit uncomfortable. So my question is -- what do we do about this? Do we just call it quits and leave the country? We have no idea. Any advice is welcomed.

"Advice on forming relationships with professors after taking online courses. So I did see a few other threads about this topic, but I have a little bit more of a specific question. So most of my time in college, I took online classes. Now I am a senior and realizing that I should have been networking this entire time. I want to get into a PhD program in psych eventually, so this will be very important! This semester I have one in-person psych class and one online. My one in-person professor is not a full time employee of the school, so he does not have office hours. I have been very involved in class and stayed after a couple times to discuss my participation and some of my future plans. My question here is how do I ensure he will have more to say besides ""Kayla was a great student and got good grades""? I do genuinely enjoy speaking with him, but since I cannot meet with him outside of class, it has been hard to actually get to know him. My other psych professor, for my online class, is an academic advisor. She also does not have office hours, so I am wondering if it would be appropriate to schedule a meeting with her through advising or to show up and ask if she has a moment to speak? In her syllabus it says to contact her through email with any questions we have, so it seems she does not typically welcome in-person meetings. Another general question: If it takes a couple years for me to be accepted into a program, should I be keeping in contact with the professors I build rapport with? I feel like it might be weird to request a letter of recommendation after so long without reaching out every once in a while and keeping them updated, right?",Faculty,Low,0.0,web:reddit:r/college:new,Low,0,1670,314,6,Advice on forming relationships with professors after taking online courses.,0

"My fault? Or my colleges. I am a first generation college student, immigrant, and none of my parents understand anything about college and neither did I. My dream was to go to college in California (I am out of state ) and I got accepted to a pretty good public school in California + other private schools, and additionally other public and private colleges in other states. Around the month of late April-early May, when everyone received an ESTIMATED financial aid package I received absolutely nothing. This would have been crucial for me since it would have given me and my family months to plan my finances. I obviously emailed regarding the delay on 05/07/24 and I was told i would just have to wait a couple weeks. I had how ever received estimated aid from other colleges in California (private) and also received scholarships and an average tuition that was surprisingly low so I assumed that, the public school I was committing to would be very low cost (I didn’t know at the time public schools didn’t give out academic scholarships in California 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️) I emailed them a total of 4 times after that initial email to check on my ESTIMATED financial aid package and they told me they were still reviewing it + confirming other paperwork. I heard back on July 1st and was told that I should be receiving my OFFICIAL package soon (after never even getting my estimated package) That same day at night I received my OFFICIAL AID PACKAGE and emmediatly was in shock. First I was missing the FSEOG grant that I was told I would be receiving and next I was hit with a tuition and housing of around 35k. I was given no time to plan my finances for college, and basically only a month to prepare for this huge tuition and I never even received an estimate. And now I am fully committed to a school I can barely afford and if I would have known this information back in April/ Early May, with a ESTIMATED financial aid package my decisions would have been very different. I have less than a month to take out loans and discuss options with my parents and time is running. in addition if I would have known the cost of everything around May/April I would have attended an instate school which is now too late since their commitment, housing and orientation dates has passed. lastly I already have given so much money toward my college with all of the deposits I have placed.

And sure you get to schedule your own classes, pick a major, decided whether or not to actually go to those classes, decide how, when, and to what level you'll complete your homework etc. But also that's all within a structure, right? Especially once you've picked a major, you maybe have to take 15 or 20 classes out of a list of 30, you have advisors and teachers and other support staff all along the way, you have RAs in the dorms at least while you're on campus, etc. You're taking out more and more debt every year with limited checks on your ability to do so. And you know what lots of people do if they can't find a job after their bachelor's? Go back to school for a Master's, because school is familiar and comfortable, and there will continue to be a clear defined path and people watching over you and giving you immediate positive or negative feedback. It's really not totally representative of the real world, and I think you could learn just as much about being independent from trying to learn a useful skill, getting your own apartment, learning how insurance works and paying for a car, learning about saving and investing money, working towards a career of some sort rather than just a piece of paper that you're told to get. And no, going for just a few years to appease her, if you don't plan on finishing and getting a degree is a fairly large waste of money, because only completing some college does not help career prospects or potential earning power very much.

"Accepted to a bunch of top public schools but no Ivy League schools. TLDR: I am wondering why someone would get accepted to a bunch of top public schools like Cal and UCLA but rejected from all or most of the Ivies. I am curious about how common this is. Last year, my younger sister applied for colleges. She got accepted to UC Berkeley, UCLA, UC Davis, UCSC, UC Riverside, and UC Merced. She got waitlisted to all the other UCs, which I suspect was due to being overqualified for them. She also got accepted into certain schools like USC, UOP, U of Oregon, U of Washington, Northeastern, and Boston University. She even got accepted to Emory as a Woodruff Scholarship Finalist. She was waitlisted to some great schools like Pitzer and Pomona. However, what is notable is that she still went 0 for 4 on Ivy Day, getting rejected from Harvard, Yale, Brown, and Dartmouth. She also applied REA to Stanford and got rejected. She is a valedictorian with something like a 4.4 GPA and a 33 on the ACT. (I know she retook it after that but I forgot what her new score was; I want to say it was either 34 or 35.) She was relatively involved in her high school; she was a member of the orchestra (violin), the tennis team, and several clubs. She is an Eagle Scout, and she was a founding member of a troop for girls that a local Boy Scouts troop created a few years ago (now called Scouts BSA). She did a lot of outdoor activities, leadership, and community service there. She did a drip irrigation system for her Eagle project. She also did an internship with the California Department of Water Resources where she researched and did data analysis on fish in an estuary. For a while she also regularly wrote ambassador reports on this ecology-related networking site called Tunza. She is very passionate about biology and environmental science and wants to work in the medical field or ecology field. She wants to do research. I recall most of her application essays being written very well. I think she generally did great on her interviews. She ultimately chose to go to UCLA. It was her favorite school out of all the options and she is generally enjoying her first year there. However, I have heard complaints from her and my mother on how impersonal the experience there is in terms of certain things like finding classes and housing. How she often has to fend for herself or there is a lack of communication. A lot of it is because UCLA is such a big public school, like virtually all UCs, and UC’s, while prestigious, are known to a fault to focus on research and under-prioritize the lives of their undergraduate students in the process. I suspect those aspects would be quite a bit better at a school like Harvard or Stanford. Do not get me wrong. I am definitely proud of all her hard work in getting into UCLA and all these schools. I am happy she’s liking it there. Part of me, though, is curious how things would’ve played out differently if she had to weigh Cal and UCLA against the Ivies. It is worth noting that we are Asian and we live in California. I’m curious why she got so many acceptances from all these great public schools like Cal and UCLA but nothing with the Ivies.

"Secondary education in the U.S. is highly variable in quality. There is public schooling and then there is private schooling. Taking private schooling out of the equation, quality varies greatly within public schools, from one district to the district. On whole, American public schooling isn't great, and is especially mediocre in teach math. Students who do well are given more responsibility (more opportunities to learn.) Students who are troubled are often simply managed, with the goal of getting them to pass/ cycle through. The way that the U.S. funds public school districts encourages a sort of race to the bottom. 1) Keep butts in seats -- attendance. 2) Teach to a test, with the goal that most students pass (rather than excel.) 3) It leans very heavily on localized control and funding, which amplifies localized disparities. The public education system in the U.S. is by no means national. Post-secondary education: colleges and universities have purportedly ""democratized"" in the U.S. since the 1950s onwards. It will be closer to the truth to say that they have become Big Business and are devoted to a broad, debt-carrying and consumerist model. They happily convince students to take on outsized debts.

"What does Hollywood tell us about the cultural reception of Title IX changes afoot it 2025. As we approach the beginning of a new administration that has promised to address concerns regarding Title IX legislation, it occurs to me that the current news headlines from Hollywood could have a cultural impact. It seems that in the last two really big Hollywood news stories involving sexual misconduc (Amber Heard and Johnny Depp/Blake Livel and Justin Baldoni) it appears clear that the complainant was not only being less than entirely honest, but in the final analysis was also pretty much of a horrible person. So what is this? Have to do with Title IX? Well, under that protocol, there is no mechanism by which the variable of the complainant being a liar and a horrible person can be addressed. A lot of people on this subreddit, for example, are entirely unwilling to even address the subject as relevant to the discussion. However, from the perspective of the general public, the public intellectuals employed by our universities ultimately serve, there is increasing cognitive dissonance here. While the traditional “less than 2%” figure is still held by many as the appropriate number to quote concerning the possibility of false accusations, Hollywood generates much different numbers – perhaps as high as 100%, if we are to go by the headlines at least. Anyway, I had a discussion with an LLM about these issues (Gemini) and here is the transcript: ** **ME** If Blake lively made identical accusations against Justin Baldoni while they were both members of an educational community under title nine legislation, where would the case be now? what would happen to Justin? **GEMINI** The case would likely be in a similar stage as Blake Lively's case against Justin Baldoni, with some key differences: Similarities: • Initial Complaint: The process would likely begin with a complaint filed with the educational institution's Title IX office, outlining the alleged harassment and the impact on the complainant's educational environment. • Investigation: The Title IX office would conduct an investigation, gathering evidence and interviewing both parties and potential witnesses. • Determination: Based on the investigation, the Title IX office would make a determination regarding whether the alleged harassment occurred and if it created a hostile environment. • Potential Outcomes: o If the accused is found responsible, sanctions could range from disciplinary action (suspension, expulsion) to mandatory training or restrictions on campus activities. o The complainant may also be offered remedies like academic support, counseling, or no-contact orders. Differences: • Publicity: The case likely wouldn't attract the same level of media attention as a case involving high-profile celebrities. This could lead to a faster and less scrutinized process. • Legal Representation: It's less likely that both parties would have high-powered legal teams involved, potentially leading to a less adversarial and more focused process on resolving the issue within the educational community. • Confidentiality: Educational institutions typically prioritize maintaining the privacy of those involved in Title IX cases, which could result in less public information about the proceedings and outcomes. What would happen to Justin? • Investigation and Potential Sanctions: Justin would be subject to the same investigative process as in Blake Lively's case. If found responsible for violating Title IX, he could face disciplinary action from the educational institution, such as suspension or expulsion. • Reputational Damage: Even if not found responsible, the accusations and investigation could damage his reputation within the educational community and potentially beyond. • Limited Impact on Career: Unlike Blake Lively's case, where Justin faced potential career consequences due to his public image, the impact on his career might be less severe, depending on his field of study and future aspirations. Overall: The case would likely follow a similar trajectory to Blake Lively's case, but with less media attention and potentially different outcomes due to the specific circumstances of the educational environment. The focus would be on resolving the issue within the community and providing support to the complainant while ensuring a fair process for the accused. **ME**At some institutions, Justin would not have the right to counter Sue, and may not have the right to any legal representation. Is that right? **GEMINI**You're raising an important point about the complexities of Title IX proceedings. While Title IX is designed to protect individuals from sex-based discrimination, the specific procedures and rights afforded to parties involved can vary between institutions. Here's a breakdown of the issues you mentioned: Right to Counter-Sue: • Generally No Right to Counter-Sue Under Title IX: Title IX proceedings are administrative, not legal. They focus on determining if a policy violation occurred and providing remedies within the educational context. There's typically no mechanism for a counter-suit within the Title IX process itself. • Possible Legal Action Outside Title IX: The accused could potentially explore defamation or other legal claims in civil court separately, but this is independent of the Title IX process. Right to Legal Representation: • Variations Between Institutions: Policies on legal representation in Title IX proceedings vary significantly. o Some institutions allow attorneys to fully participate, including cross-examining witnesses. o Others permit advisors (who can be attorneys) but limit their active role, such as only advising their client. o Some institutions, particularly K-12 schools, may restrict attorney involvement more strictly. • 2020 Regulations Impact: The 2020 Title IX regulations mandate that institutions allow advisors (including attorneys) to be present during live hearings and to inspect evidence. However, the regulations don't explicitly require institutions to allow attorneys to actively participate in the hearing. Concerns Regarding Limited Rights: • Due Process Concerns: Critics argue that limiting legal representation or the right to counter-sue can create an imbalance, especially in complex cases. This raises concerns about the accused's ability to mount a full defense. • Potential for Abuse: There are concerns that without adequate procedural safeguards, the Title IX system could be vulnerable to misuse or false accusations, potentially harming the accused's reputation and education. Important Considerations: • Institutional Policies: It's crucial to understand the specific Title IX policies of the institution in question to determine the rights and limitations for both the complainant and the accused. • Seeking Legal Advice: If facing a Title IX complaint, seeking advice from an attorney experienced in Title IX matters is highly recommended, even if the attorney's role in the proceedings is limited. The issues you raise highlight the ongoing debate about balancing the need to protect individuals from sex discrimination with ensuring fair and equitable processes for all parties involved in Title IX proceedings. **ME**In many circumstances, the decision of how to dispose of the complaint would likely be up to a single administrator, most likely a Title IX professional whose role would basically be judge and jury throughout. Is that right? You're right, that's a common concern with Title IX proceedings. In many cases, a single Title IX coordinator or administrator has significant influence over the investigation and outcome of a complaint. Here's how it often works: • Title IX Coordinator as Central Figure: The Title IX coordinator is often responsible for receiving complaints, overseeing investigations, and making decisions or recommendations about sanctions. • Investigator Role: While some institutions have separate investigators, the Title IX coordinator may sometimes conduct the investigation themselves or heavily influence its direction. • Decision-Maker: In some cases, the Title IX coordinator may be the sole decision-maker on whether a policy violation occurred and what sanctions, if any, to impose. In other cases, they may make recommendations to a panel or higher authority. Concerns about this Model: • Potential for Bias: Critics argue that having a single person act as investigator, judge, and jury can create a risk of bias, especially if the Title IX coordinator has pre-existing opinions or relationships with either party. • Lack of Checks and Balances: This model may lack the checks and balances present in a traditional judicial system, where separate parties are responsible for investigation, prosecution, and adjudication. • Power Imbalance: It can create a perceived or actual power imbalance, particularly for the accused, who may feel they lack a fair opportunity to present their defense. Counterarguments: • Expertise and Efficiency: Proponents argue that having a dedicated Title IX coordinator streamlines the process and ensures that someone with expertise in Title IX law and regulations handles the case. • Focus on Resolution: The goal of Title IX is often to resolve complaints and address harm within the educational community, rather than strictly punish the accused. This model may be seen as more conducive to achieving that goal. • Informal and Supportive: Some argue that a less adversarial process, with a focus on fact-finding and resolution, can be less traumatic for all parties involved. It's important to note: • Variations between Institutions: The specific roles and responsibilities of Title IX coordinators vary between institutions. Some have more robust systems with multiple investigators and decision-making panels. • 2020 Regulations Impact: The 2020 Title IX regulations introduced some changes, including requiring live hearings with cross-examination in certain circumstances. However, these regulations have been criticized for potentially tilting the process in favor of the accused. • Ongoing Debate: The role of the Title IX coordinator and the structure of the process remain subjects of debate, with ongoing efforts to balance fairness, efficiency, and effective response to sex discrimination",Examination,High,2.0,web:pullpush:r/Professors:submission:complaint,High,2,10286,1549,5,What does Hollywood tell us about the cultural reception of Title IX changes afoot it 2025.,0

"Is this a reasonable thing to request of a roommate. Is it reasonable to ask your dorm roommate to be quiet, while you are studying? I assume it is somewhat reasonable because it was written as an option in a roommate contract that we both agreed to and signed in September. When I am in the room, I am studying (reading, etc) almost all of the time. My roommate, plays video games all day, when he is in the room. Meanwhile he uses an audio headset, to talk to other gamers, so I hear him talking all of the time. I raised the issue with him earlier in the year, when at that point he was constantly playing sound from his music and video games, without ever asking if I minded. I told him about my ADHD, and that I need to have quiet, in order to focus at all. So he agreed to stop being loud and to not be social in the room while I am studying. That worked for a while, but recently he started talking on the headset every night again. And I just can't be in this room to study, with the constant noise distracting me. With my ADHD I can only really focus if I am in control of my surroundings, in terms of minimizing noise or distractions. So going to the library is not the best option. But if he were to be quiet, that would mean he'd have to take his entire gaming system out of the dorm, and I don't know where he could go, I know he certainly wouldn't want to have to leave the room. And both of us use the room when we are not in classes. How should I approach him about this? Or negotiate this? Is it fair to ask for general quiet whenever I am in the room (because if I'm going to be honest, if I am in the room, that means study time)? And I looked up if my university has any policies. Found this noise policy: Every student living within a residence hall at ____ University has the right to privacy in her/his own room. Just as a student has the right to reasonable protection against unwarranted physical intrusion, s/he also has the right to reasonable protection against the uninvited intrusion of noise. Each student should expect to be able to sleep, study, converse, listen to the music of her/his choice, etc. within the privacy of her/his own room, reasonably free from disruption resulting from the activities of others. No time of day or day of the week may curtail these rights. But it doesn't say whether studying is more important than conversing/listening to music.

"If I were in this position I’d definitely be really frustrated, but I also know my frustration wouldn’t accomplish anything. One of my major issues with academia is that when you’re good at your job you’re rewarded with more work and when you’re bad you’re rewarded with less, and this is a classic example of that. However, the reality is as academics we have bought into this system so there’s not a ton we can do to change it. And there’s always going to be some inherent unfairness especially when it comes to teaching as not all courses are equal in terms of the amount of work/prep and course releases are not always given equitably. My best advice would be to wait a year and apply for external jobs when you’re not 8 months pregnant. If you get any interviews/traction, meet with your chair and mention this issue (seemingly unfair teaching releases, unequal treatment etc) and see what they come back with. The threat of an external offer might be enough to warrant some sort of teaching release or other compensation. Or wait until you get tenure and bring this issue up again with your chair at that stage",Academic,High,2.0,web:pullpush:r/academia:comment:unfair,High,2,1116,199,0,"If I were in this position I’d definitely be really frustrated, but I also know my frustration wouldn’t accomplish anything.",0

"Returning to college after a decade. So I set up an appointment in January to meet with someone from my local community college's admissions office now that I've established residency after moving to Canada from the US! Thing is I've been out of school since 2015 at this point. When I last attended I was in a bad place mentally and didn't take anything seriously including high school since I didn't want to be there. Skip forward 10 years and I'm finally going back, any tips on how to prepare myself? From what I understand I'll be using the Adult Learning Program to get my grade 12 math, chemistry and biology up to an acceptable level for the program I wish to persue afterwards since I never took those back in the US.

"I’m (18F) not interested in a STEM major anymore and I’m scared to tell my parents. So I’m just about finished with my first semester at University, and my current major is computer science. Well we took the final for the class, submitted final projects, all that jazz and my overall grade has ended up being a C or C+. Usually this would be fine to pass a class however for this intro class we need a B to move on. Now I already wasn’t a fan from like the third week of school, and now that I have to retake this class I’m just straight up not having a good time, and when looking at the next class it’s basically the same concepts being taught again, and I really don’t want to do this kind of stuff three times. I loved robotics and cyber security in middle/high school but data structures and algorithms just aren’t my cup of tea and I’m bored and not performing as well as I had hoped. I was looking through what my university had to offer and I saw something I’m really interested in, creative media and animation. I already draw and I’m teaching myself how to use blender in my free time and that just sounds way more enjoyable as something I could do as a career. Except like the title says, it’s not a STEM major, and ya know the cliche of starving artists.but I really much rather do something I enjoy rather than what I’m being expected to do despite the average pay being less. I guess I need help with figuring out if this is a risk and/or just something stupid and if I go through with it how do I tell my parents? Edit: adding some info cause of repetitive replies, no hard feelings yo So I have done research, I’m okay with the average annual income and I know that it’ll be tough to start out with but it’s that way for almost everyone so I’m expecting it. I’ve been looking into internships, however as far as I’ve seen they are looking for upperclassmen so I plan on using the time now to building up a portfolio and learn as much as I can inside and outside the classroom because i really want to do this. I’m perfectly content with being able to survive comfortably and do something I love. I’m currently receiving financial aid, however my parents have said they’d help me pay it back, but they threatened if I failed I would be on my own. So that’s a sort of double hit. Overall, I’m prepping as much as I can for both short term and long term goals. Edit2: I don’t plan on studying typical art where I sit down and paint, I specifically want to go into 3D modeling/rigging that could be used in animation and games. As someone mentioned, a degree isn’t going to guarantee a job in anything, yes there is high demand for different things but I think looking at this like “you’d actually make money in stem” is unfair. Again, I realize that it won’t be easy either way, and I’m not in school to have fun, I’m here because I want to learn, I played it safe and went into CS because I already had some experience with programming, but if I’m already feeling burn out and miserable I don’t want to waste all that time and money.

"Parents say I’m “abandoning” for attending concert at night the day after move-in. I will start off by saying I love my parents very much and appreciate everything they've done for me. I (F18) am a freshman and will be moving in to my dorm in a few days. My parents and I are traveling to the location the day before move-in, however, they have decided not to leave until two days after move-in (they will be there for 3 nights). I've never had an issue with this, as I genuinely want to spend time with them before they leave. That said, one of my friends will also be in town, and we got tickets to see a concert the night after the day I move in to my dorm- I didn't think this was a big deal, since it's at night and, in my mind, I would be staying in my dorm anyways to get acclimated before classes start soon after. However, upon telling my parents this, they got upset (to put it lightly) and claimed I was being selfish and that this ""showed where my priorities were"". To an extent, I understand where they're coming from- you want to spend time with your kid before leaving them at college. However, am I wrong for thinking a few hours at night the day after I move in is ok?

"Hell at a CC, Heaven at a Univ. What would you do. This academic year, I’ve taught at two different institutions—a suburban community college (CC) and a primarily Black university (not an HBCU, but close demographically). The contrast in my experiences at these two places has been staggering. At the CC, last fall, I had two White female students falsely accuse me and the only other POC in the room, students, of inappropriate behavior. They even went as far as starting a [**Change.org**](http://Change.org) petition to have me removed. Thankfully, the administration saw through it and shut it down, but the situation was absurd. (A mentor at this same CC once told me she received student complaints simply for being visibly pregnant because some students, female students, found it “uncomfortable” to look at her. Yikes.) This semester at the CC has been frustrating in a different way. I’ve had students who would argue with me over the most basic facts—if I said **2 + 2 = 2 × 2**, they’d claim I was ~~wrong~~ \* lying because **2 + 3 ≠ 2 × 3**. They constantly demanded clear-cut “always/never” answers to concepts that require nuance. Some questioned whether I knew the subject matter, then got confused when I explained things in depth, assuming their confusion meant I must not know what I was talking about. Then, there was a student who—while making a graph—**deleted half the data points** to get a “perfect” best-fit line. I provided feedback, ran it by colleagues, and thought I handled it appropriately. But the dean, who happened to be observing, claimed I was “dressing down” the student. Apparently, holding students accountable for scientific integrity is too harsh? On top of that, I was also criticized for being “disorganized” for not setting up everything **30 minutes early**, despite the fact that **I don’t even have keys** to unlock crucial lab equipment, and there is a lab manager whose entire job is to handle that. **In contrast, at the primarily Black university where I’m also teaching the exact same transferable course, I’ve had an entirely different experience.** A former CC student who had me last year saw me here and must have spread a good word—because my class size **doubled**. The students have been **engaged, hardworking, and motivated**. They try, they ask insightful questions, and they succeed. The lab is properly set up. I have support from tutors and student assistants who help with demonstrations. Everything just **works** the way it’s supposed to. It honestly feels like I stepped into the world of *A Different World*, but in real life. The part that makes me the angriest? The students at this university—who work their butts off to earn their grades—will go through life **constantly having their qualifications questioned**. They’ll be labeled “DEI hires” and subjected to ignorance, no matter how competent they are. Meanwhile, the students at the mostly White CC, **who openly question whether I even know physics while putting in minimal effort**, will be given the **benefit of the doubt** and assumed to be twice as competent. It’s infuriating. Also If you know who I am please save it it's not really truly possible for me to be anonymous enough that someone who had general knowledge of who teaches Physics around my part of the world wouldn't know who I was. I'm not famous but. just there aren't a lot of people like me doing it. I just both needed to vent and find out what others think? \*I used AI to re-write this.

"I think it depends on your class size and your relationship with the students. I find cold calling can sometimes be a bit of an unfair strategy, because some students just might not be in the right headspace on that day. You could have a student who is doing really well - but if their assigned cold call day is just *one* bad day for them, that will negatively influence both your view of them as a professor as well as their performance in the class. The day that you call on them, they may not understand the material well enough yet as they haven't gotten time to work through it at home. They may be having a rough day in their personal life. They may be sick and therefore not in attendance (I tell all my students not to come to class if they're sick - I don't want to get sick either). There are a million reasons a student may struggle to answer such a question beyond just being a slacker. I also think this style of questioning can create a bit of an aggressive or stressful classroom environment that creates a fear of answering wrong. Personally I've had a lot more luck fostering discussion in small groups by engaging with the students authentically on topics they seem connected to, and making it clear that no contribution is ""wrong"". We can find something to discuss about their statement as a class even if they got some of the facts wrong. The students who contribute to discussions in my class receive participation marks that are collective over the course of the semester. Students who never choose to engage don't get marks. But students who *try* get rewarded. And I think that makes a far bigger impact than the fear of getting an answer wrong in front of their peers. At the end of the day, you want to be an instructor that the students feel supported by, rather than judged by. And I just feel like cold calls do more of the latter, rather than the former.

"A laundry list of Stanford's shortcomings, as written by Stanford students. Inspired by the post about Stanford's poor study abroad programs, I stumbled across an article by the Stanford Daily where over 100 Stanford students complain about their school. Here's their list: &gt;At the start of last week, I sent a few e-mail lists an invitation for students to anonymously vent their biggest Stanford-related frustrations by listing them on a Google Doc. There were over 100 individual responses (over 120 if you include the trolls). &gt;From what I read, students’ complaints seem to have fallen into a few big categories: &gt;**Lack of diversity** &gt;One student appeared to capture many others’ thoughts with the concise response, “Stanford is repressive of discussions about class and socioeconomic status.” Students are frustrated with what passes for the norm at Stanford, and many spoke of hiding their beliefs and backgrounds so as to avoid persecution. Those who feel most antagonized seem to be low-income students, Christians, those with conservative viewpoints and students who aren’t attracted to alcohol and the college party culture. &gt;**Academic structure** &gt;Some students hate the quarter system. Some think, “academic advising is a total joke.” Engineers wish they had more time to take classes outside of engineering. “Financial aid really hurts a large portion of middle class students.” IHUM has both good and bad points. &gt;**Social scene** &gt;Many, many students wish alcohol wasn’t such a staple of undergrad life. Palo Alto and Stanford are too expensive, and San Francisco is much less accessible than Stanford would like ProFros to think. There needs to be a central hang-out location on campus; the “student center sucks/almost does not exist.” Also, “the dating sucks.” &gt;**Work ethic** &gt;“I’m tired of kids who know how to test well, but have forgotten how to learn,” is a feeling echoed by many. Pre-meds in particular have gotten a bad rep: “Medicine is a hallowed profession. Treat it like a privilege, not a game.” And one respondent said Stanford students “only care about the world when it will help them get fellowships &amp; scholarships, just like all those clubs they joined in high school.” &gt;**Attitudes toward life** &gt;This was the biggest section; it seemed many students think Stanford kids are too “success”-driven and not relationship-driven enough, and then those same Stanford kids complain about feeling lonely. The “Stanford Duck Syndrome” and “faking your feelings” were also mentioned a great deal, as were “ego” and “elitism.” Also, according to a few respondents, students aren’t activist enough: “Whatever happened to protests?” &gt;**Health** &gt;At CAPS, there’s “a lack of availability of appointments [and] ineffectiveness of said appointments.” At Vaden, “if you’re not an athlete, you don’t matter.” And the Bridge “has good ideas but fails at making people feel better&lt;\p&gt;.&lt;\p&gt;.&lt;\p&gt;.&lt;\p&gt;” &gt;**Biking** &gt;“For smart people, we ride bikes like idiots.” Also, “lighting around campus sucks,” as does parking. &gt;**Food** &gt;Several students want 24-hour food, several want cheaper food, several want more options and the list goes on. &gt;**Resident life** &gt;There were complaints of poor hygiene and students disrespecting custodial staff (“What, are you used to having a maid or something?”). Several were disappointed with the noisy party culture ingrained in their dorms and poor leadership by ResEd staff. A few were angry they had never gotten a single",Hostel,Medium,1.0,web:pullpush:r/ApplyingToCollege:submission:complaint,Medium,1,3566,544,9,"A laundry list of Stanford's shortcomings, as written by Stanford students.",0

"As a former student, I just wanted to ask, Why would a HS teacher who has known and taught the same set of students for 3 years, all of a sudden hate them when they get into Senior Year? Note that she hates her senior classes EVERY YEAR. As a former student, I just wanted to ask a question. I will try to explain the format, but if its confusing let me know. I had a high school teacher who taught 1 subject for 3 classes during the school year. (Sophomore, Junior, Senior). She has also been teaching for many years, so she probably has tenure. This particularly subject is very information-heavy (I'm trying not to get too specific here, so its not identifying her or the school), so it takes 3 school years to learn it all. This means each student who take her class starts sophomore year all the way to their senior year. (Reminder: the subject is not the typical English, math, science, social studies, art, or music, it's more specific) I know for a fact that she has treated multiple senior classes, (Ex: mine, the year before me, etc) unfairly, because I've heard and seen the way she acted with them. (I have also heard that her college students are treated the same way as well.) I also know that Senioritis is not the reason for her behavior and change in attitude, because these classes did not slack off. With regards to my class, we were all basically a bunch of nerds lol. We actually cared about this class, our grades, and hoping to do something related to this subject in our future. Junior year, I remember thinking that I only wanted to have her class for the whole day bc it was fun then, but by senior year, all of us couldn't wait to get out of the room. Sophomore year she was nice, normal, helpful and known to joke around a little. However, these good times would soon dwindle and she would be mean, angry, and annoyed by senior year. I honestly don't think she just got tired of us after 3 years; there's being tired and then there's being controlling. The point is every year, with every senior class, she will have an attitude, be very rude, and express very controlling behaviors towards the senior students. The senior class has this teacher as their first class in the morning, and I remember, every time we would walk in, none of us knew which mood this teacher would be in. First thing in the morning, students in the class didn't even say anything or did anything to her, and the teacher would already be mad at us. We felt like she brought her personal problems and anger issues into the classroom. I felt like the school just wouldn't do anything about it when we'd ask for help. Plus, I remember feeling like we just have to sit there and take it until we graduate because she's the one in control of the grades. Like okay I guess I'll spend hours doing a project for her and a bunch of schoolwork she just randomly came up with even though I have 5 other classes that assign HW, college stuff, personal things to deal with etc, every day for 5 days a week. Tbh, some of the things she has said makes me think that she might be on this subreddit or at least has read some of it before class. (I know people mostly vent on here and I've read some things that sounded familiar to her and her views) I'll say it, I was kinda scared of her, and I still am writing this, but I want any explanations.

"Here are some things you need to know: First of all, some background on me: I’m a college instructor at the community college level. I'm a full-time instructor and not an adjunct, so I'm included in meetings and don't have to bounce around different colleges and campuses just to make money. I have a salary and, unlike a part-time adjunct instructor, I don't make a couple thousand per class and teach 8 classes at 4 different colleges (which they only have to do because they can't make enough at one college, and because if they taught any more than two classes at each college, that college would have to consider them more than just part-time and would have to provide benefits of some kind, I believe, which includes healthcare). So, I'm in all the conversations we have about students, enrollment, passing rates, class difficulty, accreditation, etc. In fact, probably the only reason any instructor is full-time at a public college is that the accrediting bodies that ""vet"" colleges mandate that a certain percentage of the instructors must be full-time and not just adjunct or part-time instructors. Now, regarding those online homework costs.I don’t fully know why, but the textbook companies have all kinds of deals with colleges. I don’t know if they kick back a little portion of the profits from the books, which I doubt, or if the textbook companies won’t agree to supply the books to our bookstores unless we also choose to use the software packages/web-based homework. My guess is that the true issue is that the textbook company showed us the retail price of their textbook and ebook, but gave us a discounted price for the students if we bundle their coursework package into our courses somehow. So, basically, if we didn’t use the homework package, they would sell us the book for 200 dollars, but if we do use the coursework package, they will sell the ebook and course package for 100 or the physical book and course web homework package for 160 or 175 or something. I’m in English so it’s significantly lower, but we also have the course homework package (75 ebook/courseware combo or 125 book/ebook/courseware combo). So, it’s, as far as I can tell on the conversations I’ve been in, completely financial and in your interests, not ours. We always mention that the textbook prices are too high and the webwork too, in like every meeting, and administration is on us to bring those costs down as well, but we’ve gone with the cheapest book that is still of decent quality and that’s as low as we can get it. So, we are honestly all trying to keep the costs as low as we can. Now, let me also tell you something else. Your parents may have told you, when you started college, the one thing they remember about books, and were shocked and appalled to hear how wrong they were: buy your books used. That’s possible SOMEtimes, but it’s rarely possible now with the software packages. Basically, here’s the deal: the textbook companies figured out when Amazon was coming up that they were getting slammed on the used book market and couldn’t make any additional money. So, they started aggressively revising their books, creating new editions every two years, which worked for awhile, because they would not supply books to the campus bookstores of old editions. So, the colleges, if they wanted to offer an option that allowed students to immediately purchase books using a portion of their financial aid package without having to wait 3 weeks for their book orders to come in on Amazon AFTER they waited 3 weeks for their financial aid difference checks to come in, had to only offer the most recent edition. Like I said, this worked for awhile. But, the textbook companies got REALLY smart. They started developing detailed homework packages. They align directly with the textbook's contents, they are developed by people who spend all of their time working on just that, and it's far more than what the instructor can come up with on their own. Depending on the subject, some instructors may go way off the book in their instruction, but they rarely contradict the book; the style of delivery may just differ. An instructor is just one person, and almost every person has to work these days, not like in the old days when the boomers would have one person in the family working outside the home on a register at the supermarket and having enough money from that to buy a car, a home, a college education, etc. So, part-time adjunct instructors have far too many students to heavily develop online coursework on a massive scale, and full-time instructors are saddled with the same. The best we can hope for are our individual assessments and the lessons we make, but even then we all wish we had some kind of reinforcement work behind the scenes that can cater to each student's ability and learning level. So, the textbook companies capitalized on the negative effects of capitalism on educators (how thin can we stretch the teachers and still have enough students pass?) by offering them software packages that they just plop into their learning management systems like Blackboard and Canvas. Now, here's the thing; if I speak out about the feelings I am about to divulge to you to other instructors, I'm not sure how it would be met, since the few I've tried it on so far, the ones I trust in multiple fields (we aren't officed by department), the ones I call my friends, have said they are quite happy with the software in their fields and wouldn't want to give it up. So, this may not be universal. But, my feelings are this: **I fucking hate these online homework portals.** Maybe it IS easier for instructors. Maybe it IS better developed than what the instructor can do. However, the best an instructor can do with that course material is peruse it. They can't verify the veracity or accuracy of ALL of it. So, you're being tested on material the teacher didn't explicitly have a hand in developing. That's a bit dangerous, if you ask me. However, [there's a moment in a YouTube video clip of a documentary on education that covers Finland's differences with the American education system](https://youtu.be/4-DcjwzF9yc?t=169) that always haunts me as an educator. A Finnish student who had been a foreign exchange student in the United States was asked what he was relieved about as a student when he returned to Finland, and his answer was ""no more multiple choice."" Then, the interviewer asked, very sarcastically (because he's in on the joke, and knows exactly why this school system works as he's asking the questions), ""How do you answer the question right if it isn't listed as one of the four choices?"" The class all answer, basically in unison, that ""you have to know it."" They are asked questions and have to write the answers down with no word bank or list of choices. And I wonder about that every time I make an assessment. The truth is that educators are stretched so thin, conservative politicians are worried about accountability so that tax payer dollars aren't wasted on failing schools (and schools heavily populated by minorities), liberal politicians are worried about passing rates so that minorities and the poor can use their education for upward socioeconomic mobility, and so the testing happens, teachers have no time to grade hundreds of handwritten responses, and everything gets dumped onto these textbook companies, which they use to make something that SHOULD be covered completely by taxes ANYway, because of the general positive effect on society, the public benefit of having an educated populace, indispensable for instructors and, thus, profitable for them once again. But I fucking hate this online course material that I had no hand in developing. It's not just ego, here, although I'm sure my consternation with the concept has, over time, helped develop my ego, but as I see it the only way that instructors remain relevant and education remains relevant is for education to be original, inspirational, beneficial, mind-opening, and, most importantly, designed to develop positive opinions about the idea of getting an education. An education isn't a commodity or a service; it's a journey toward knowledge that one takes that leads toward incredible realizations and truths about the world. Its relevance to employment is somewhat of a by-product of that. But, I fucking HAVE to include this software stuff in my coursework, and so I make it worth the least percentage of my final class grade that I'm allowed, since I have no option to just not include it at all. Also, I hate how expensive the books are. Isn't an education good for society? Don't we want as many students as possible to get one voluntarily?

"Drawing the line. I have a student in a theatre directing practicum that has already missed 12 of our 17 class meetings and we're just over halfway in our term. The trouble is she has come to me, claiming she has missed repeatedly due to depression and her meds not working. I'm not a monster, so I offered for her to make up all her missing presentations of work for critiques so we could see if we can catch her up by a certain date, and told her that she would need to attend class. It has been over a week since that meeting and her behavior and attendance have not changed. Her deadline is next week to present. I have heard from other professors that this is a pattern of behavior. That there is a lot of no-showing, then crying in your office, and then somehow, by the end, she turns everything in. Additionally, I have a strict attendance policy on my syllabus - I allow 2 unexcused absences, after that -5% on your total grade per unexcused absence (to be excused you pretty much just have to email me and let me know you won't be there). Now, because I'm prof in a Theatre dept, I had to check my math and.This student is now at a a 50% deficit. This means even IF she gets it together to turn in any work, the highest grade she can possibly get is a 50%, which is.failing. Unless she brings a doctor's note? Or do I let her off the hook on the attendance piece? She's definitely not getting even a fraction of what I'm teaching out of the class. I'm sort of okay with it being like ""well, you're only hurting yourself and here's your D"" (again IF she turns everything else in and it's somehow great) But, where I'm really struggling is how this is for other students. It hardly seems fair to let her waltz in at the last minute, having received little-to-none of the in-class workshop education, and somehow pass my class? Can I just fail her now? Can the behavior really all rest on depression? Because it's a medical condition, should I have gotten some sort of official something from the college if it is? Like, I get Accessibility Reports for students who need certain accommodations and I haven't heard anything about this student. So, where do you draw the line? Because it seems to be a pattern (based on other professors' feedback), I want to break the pattern - it's not helping her or anyone else, but I'm sensitive to depression being a truly debilitating condition at times.What would you do?",Attendance,High,2.0,web:pullpush:r/Professors:submission:attendance,High,2,2416,447,2,Drawing the line.,0

"Cheating, Confessions, and Pressure from Above - Will you choose integrity or obedience? I chose the latter and I regret it. I’m an assistant professor at a university. While it’s not globally top ranked, it’s considered one of the best in my country. Recently, I faced two situations that left me questioning my role and values. I wonder what you would have done if you were in my shoes. **1. The Cheating Incident** I teach a programming course. During the COVID-affected semester, I had to hold the final exam online. I later found that about **95% of students submitted identical code**—clearly impossible if done independently. Some students even admitted that there were students who had solved the test early and posted answers in the class chat. Others copied. According to university regulations, this constitutes academic dishonesty, and students should receive a **zero for the entire course and a one-semester suspension**. But I felt sorry for them. So I tried to be fair: I gave zero on the copied parts but still gave points for answers they likely did themselves. The result? The class average score dropped significantly, and it got the attention of the associate dean (a civil engineering professor). After hearing the details, she said I had no ""proof"" of cheating and that my judgment was only an assumption. Since I didn’t catch them red-handed during the exam, she ordered me to **increase their grades**. **2. The Admission Interview** I was appointed to interview high school applicants for admission. Out of 30 students, one was very unusual—he spent much of the interview **badmouthing his previous school's teacher** in great detail. Based on my impression, I felt something wasn’t quite right, and I decided to fail him. That evening, the **same associate dean called me** and told me to **pass him**, saying she feared he might go on social media and post something that could damage the university's reputation. **In both cases, I followed her instructions.

"Got My First F on a College Exam—Professor’s Grading Feels Unfair, What Do I Do. Ok, so I’ve always been super invested in my studies—school is basically my life. I signed up for Calc 2 with a prof who had decent reviews. We just got our first exam back, and I had two other exams that week, so I'm kinda ashamed to say but I was expecting a mid B. But to my utter shock, I got a 55. Never in my life have I failed a test. Looking through it, the mistakes I made were tiny—like I wrote 1 instead of -1 in a formula. But this guy docked points for every single part of the problem that followed, so that one mistake cost me 10 points. Same thing for other problems. His grading feels insane. And it’s not like this old fuck doesn’t make mistakes himself—he can’t even get through a problem on the board without students correcting him multiple times and him forgetting preclac formulas. The thing is, I actually knew the material pretty decently—a 55 is what you give to someone who’s completely lost, but my problems were solved all the way through with tiny errors. It feels like he was trying to get 0 - maybe he was trynna remember how to count backwards cuz he's dumb as fuck.

"This is an automated service intended to preserve the original text of the post. *This post may be a bit long, but I'm going through a moral dilemma that could potentially have serious consequences for my family, career, and academic endeavors. I'm trying to decide whether it is worth it to redeem myself by confessing my academic dishonesty to my alma mater, and what the potential consequences may be for my career, and academic endeavors. I'll begin by saying that I don't believe that any of the behaviors that I engaged in were acceptable, and in the end I realized that the person who I cheated the most is myself. One of the things that I remember most from my freshman year of college is my professor telling the class that the reason you shouldn't cheat is because you will have a voice in your head for the rest of your life saying that you aren't capable. I finally came to understand that he was right. I started my freshman year off on the wrong foot by cheating on my math placement exam because I was afraid of getting behind on pre-reqs for my Computer Science courses, which resulted in me being placed in Calculus 1. This was obviously a poor choice, since fast-forward a few months and I ended up dropping the course because I was unable to handle the material. Instead of resolving my deficiency by going back and taking pre-calculus, I made the stupid mistake of doubling down and attempting to take Calculus 1 a second time. Half-way through the spring semester, COVID-19 hit and courses went completely online. At the time COVID hit, I had roughly a B in the course, though I saw this as an opportunity to cheat going forward since exams were not going to be proctored and I felt incompetent from having dropped the course the previous semester. My partner at the time ended up taking the remainder of the course for me, which boosted my grade all the way up to an A at the end of the semester. Of course, my cheating in Calculus 1 dug me into a deeper hole which made it so that the only option if I were to continue going ""forward"" was to cheat in Calculus 2, which I took my sophomore year. I didn't complete a single assignment or assessment for Calculus 2, which also resulted in me receiving an A for the course. Later in my sophomore year I took discrete mathematics for computer science. By this time, I had a group of friends who were motivated students, though severely lacking in ethics. The discrete mathematics course I was taking was difficult, and one of my peers who was also in the course at the time who convinced me that we should work through the course together. I ""teamed"" on exams with said peer at the time, since I thought that this was the best way to get through the course, rather than working to develop an understanding of the material. As anyone can tell by reading thus far, I effectively created a weak foundation and ruined my self-confidence for the rest of my undergraduate career by cheating in three important pre-requisite courses. My junior year in one of my computer science courses, I received exam questions in advance from other students who had taken the online assessment hours before. I got caught cheating in this course on the first exam because I let another student look at my code and they copied down my procedures almost verbatim after I told them what parts they should change (not a huge surprise). My professor failed me on the exam and said that if he caught me cheating again, he would report me to the dean. Instead of trying to do better and not cheat again in the future, this simply set me into a mental health spiral and I ended up cheating again on the remaining exams in the course anyways. Somehow I felt that it was ""necessary"" to cheat in this course, since students who I believed were more competent than me who had taken the course a previous semester told me that they took the exam together in the same room. I'm not going to keep going into details on remaining courses, since I don't particularly want to dox myself or make this too long, though these were the worst cheating sins I committed during my undergraduate studies. In total, I tallied up how many courses I have cheated in college, including the courses above and it comes out to: * **Courses counting towards degree:** 1. Calculus 1 (cheated on second half of course) 2. Calculus 2 (cheated through entire course) 3. Discrete math (teamed with other students on exams) 4. Core CS requirement (TA answer key) 5. Core CS requirement (looked at another students code for inspiration on parts of a project) 6. Gen ed (used Quizlet occasionally) 7. Gen ed (used Google on two weekly quizzes) * **Courses that did not count towards my degree:** 1. Gen ed (used Quizlet on two exams) 2. CS course (cheated on online exams) 3. CS course (cheated on project, retook course honestly and grade was replaced) After my cheating in Calculus 1, Calculus 2, and Discrete Math, I truly ruined my confidence in my quantitative skills, and the unfortunate thing is that I would have had no problem getting good grades in the remaining courses by being completely honest since I felt that I understood the material. Most of the time I cheated, it was because I wanted A's rather than risking getting a few percentage points lower on assignments. I had a few courses that I performed poorly on early on in undergrad, and I really wanted to get into a good graduate school to do an MBA since part-way through undergrad I found that my passion was for the business side of the tech industry. Reflecting on my actions, I realize that this was completely contradictory since the reason that I wanted to do an MBA at a good graduate school was to receive a high quality of education, and yet at the same time I valued getting good grades higher than the education that I was receiving at the time. During my undergraduate studies, I made around $100k off of software engineering internships where I excelled regardless of how I performed in school, and after graduation I accepted a job offer at a prestigious company where I make into the six figures. This is exactly the sort of outcome that most cheaters would dream of, though in reflection I feel rather empty knowing that I cheated my way to get here. If I were to dig into the primary reason (out of multiple) as to why I cheated in undergrad, I would say that it was because I had a desire to get into the workforce as fast as possible, and felt that if I did things the honest way I would get ""behind"". To anyone who has this same way of thinking, please understand that the purpose of college is not to ""get through it quickly"" but rather to educate and develop yourself into a stronger person. It seems that many of my peers in undergrad had the same mentality I did, which is sad because this is absolutely undermining and ruining higher education today. Now there are two options that I have considered in order to try and mitigate the downsides of this situation. They are certainly not mutually exclusive, and I have considered taking both routes. **Option A (solve my academic deficiencies):** The bare minimum that I want to do in order to make myself more competent in my career field is to retake both calculus courses, discrete math, and the core CS requirement where I copied from the TA answer key on one of the assignments. The other dishonest offenses that I committed during my college career were bad, but in hindsight had little to no difference on my understanding of the material. This will help me feel better about my competence, though it in no way will cleanse the original grades from my transcript, which still leaves me with some guilt. **Option B (confess to the dean of my alma mater institution):** This is certainly the more difficult decision to make, and could have more far-reaching consequences. I've done plenty of research on how universities retroactively punish students for cheating after they have graduated. It seems that degree revocation is extremely rare for undergraduates, and is more common in cases of research conduct or cheating on a dissertation. The chance my degree is temporarily or permanently recalled is certainly non-zero though. I accept that if I take this route, it's essentially a guarantee that the grades in the courses that I cheated on are changed to F's and I end up with a permanent notation on my transcript which would probably ruin my dream of going to a good business school for my MBA. It might still be possible for me to do an executive MBA in the future though, since these programs care more about work experience than academics. At this point, I'm not too concerned about the ""now"" but rather the long-term, since I already learned my lesson about being focused on getting places fast while I was in undergrad. I'm also considering that it might be a good idea to complete option A before going forward with option B, since it shows some initiative that I want to make amends for my past mistakes. All in all I can say that I'm ashamed for my actions throughout undergrad, and I wish that I had the same wisdom now when I was a freshman in college. I wish that I had peers that encouraged doing things the honest way rather than condoning cheating. It seems that this is a serious problem across the board at my institution, and to some degree it makes me question whether I'm just being emotional by wanting to come forward to preserve my honor when many of my peers have done the same as me, if not worse. I also have an emotional connection with this institution, as many of my family members have received their degrees from the same place. To make matters worse, I have moral scrupulosity OCD, and it has been a literal nightmare obsessing over having cheated during my undergraduate studies. Simply put, I'm in a place that I feel that I cannot escape from and I'm miserable with myself.

"That's going to be rough tbh but it's possible. Usually people have enough time for 1 or 2 hobbies outside of work. Kids/family already take up 1 of those 2 slots. Have you considered self studying CS? It's a lot more time lenient and CS has some of the best online resources. You can definitely find a job without a degree. Look through teachyourselfcs.com and see if you're up for the curriculum they lay out. What's most important are personal projects and networking, and one of the most important things you won't be immediately exposed to if you're not at school is how to use GitHub/version control and things like scrum/agile for productivity, etc. On top of personal projects, I'd look into training and getting certifications for things like like AWS and using dev tools like Springboot, etc., you can find courses to help you get the certs on Udemy (which may be free through your library). In my experience, the teachers there are responsive to questions and the good courses update with new features of the software they're teaching.

"Shifting out of US research institute to academia in Europe. Challenges and lifestyle changes. I have been in the US for 11 years now. I work in a research institute. I have a H1B, my I140 is approved and most probably will get GC in 3 - 4 years. My salary is not super high ($130k) but enough for me and my life in a MCOL Tier 2 city. With everything that has been happening in the US in 2025, even the apparently stable job at a research institute has become difficult. Funding might be cut, and although I may not face a job loss, motivation and work is at an all time low. Additionally, the problem and challenges of the US immigration system seems to be increasing. Going to stamp visa is becoming uncertain. Plus I have a small apartment here and I am constantly worried about what will happen to it if I lose my job or I go out of the USA ( for travel) and unable to come back. Currently, I have put the condo on the market. Added to the fact I am all alone in the US ( no family, no partner ) and life has been very lonely. Struggled with depression, loneliness, and anxiety disorder for years now. Lack of family support, cut off from India has wrecked my personal life as well. Staying away from my parents, I have become detached with them. I have lost connection with friends back in India. My mental health has still not been able to affect my work though. I have always excelled at my career. Amidst all this uncertainty, I applied for a faculty position at a respectable university in Europe ( Nordic country) and got the job offer. I am now thinking of shifting out. However, this brings with it a large salary cut. Plus there is the added challenge of relocating to a new place, new environment. I am not very aware of life in Europe for an Indian immigrant like me. However, I saw that they do have a path to PR in 5 years. My questions are - 1. With the high taxes and low salary - will life take a turn for the worse in Europe? ( I don't want to start living a financially constrained life again at the age of 34) 2. I consistently see that these nordic countries have higher standards of living and more happiness metrics. What does this mean? How will my life be better? 3. Considering the fact I would be leaving a chill permanent position at a job I really do passionately enjoy for 1 year of probation and hopefully tenure in 5 years - its an uphill challenge to be an academic. Is it worth putting up a struggle considering that the present situation in the US might be temporary? If this post resonates with you or you have information, please do comment.If there is anyone from a Nordic country ( Professor, Postdoc etc. ) and would like to provide me some guidance I will be very happy.

"Would I be able to get fasfa after starting college and taking a year off. I went to college and did horrible bc id never gotten help for adhd. I made good friends and was supposed to live w them the next year. My parents than pulled me out of my apartment bc of my grades randomly w out telling me or my friends they were gonna so my friends got mad at me. I guess I should have gone on my own to get adhd help freshman year of college but my parents told me I was tested as a kid and didn’t have it. My mom and I decided I could go back to college sophomore year if I got an A in my summer classes. We decided to get me help for adhd before the summer classes bc other wise there would be no point in trying to get better grades. But than each day my mom kept telling my my appointment to get adhd medication was pushed back. And at this point it was the summer after my freshman year of college but my parents moved out of my hometown so I was alone w just my parents in a town without friends. My mom kept telling me she’d take me to get adhd help each day and never took me and I ended up doing bad in the sumemr class. They blamed me but never helped me. My prnsts then took me to an eye doctor who repeatedly asked if I was bossy w my brother (I’m literally not), someone who opposes change (my friends always say how I’m down for whatever and I am easy going and spontaneous, and if I’m good at math (I’m not). My mom screamed “YESl at all of his questions where he asked if I randomly yelled at family and stuff. The guy basically was saying autism traits and I think he thought i had autism which I don’t. But ifk the doctor was a creep and kept telling me how I was insanely attractive. He wanted a 10k$ check right than for me to get help for my “issues” which he didn’t even say the name of. My mom wanted to sign and send me there bc he said I have convergence insufficiency. I told my mom that we should wait bc this doctor required immediate money and took years to treat things. I said we should Try $20 adhd meds first bc they work immediately. She yelled no and I got mean texts from my brother about how I didn’t go to the eye doctor. My parents wouldn’t listen and take me for adhd help. I than got yelled at by my parents to submit a medical withdrawal for my grades for months. The problem is I had no diagnoses bc they wouldn’t take me to get diagnosed w adhd. Eventually I got taken to get adhd help only bc my brother asked to go for him. My mom let my brother go in the room alone w the doctor but refused to let me go alone. She yelled at the adhd doctor saying I only wanted drugs even tho I’m not a drug person so? The doctor tried to reason w her and she was acting so dramatic and weird to the doctor he got uncomfortable and just repeated “ok” w. Blank annoyed face like he thought she was crazy and she yelled at the nurses too. The doctor told me how my adhd medication wouldn’t work if I had toxic ppl in my life and mentioned how he didn’t even understand why my brother needed adhd meds. But when I got meds my parents said I couldn’t go back to school than told me I had fo do community college than said no to that and kept going back and fourth. I rlly think it’s unfair to punish a kid for having adhd especially since I’d take dyslexia tests in hs and told my parents i thought I had adhd but they made fun of me and even made fun of me w my doctor. They say it was my responsibility to get help freshman year of college but they made fun of me and made me feel lazy and dumb my whole life. I also Spent so long trying to convicne and beg my parents and tried to get them fo understand but they never listened except my mon listened once when I tried explaining for hours and than creepily hugged me saying “it’s ok to express ur feelings” ina. Weird voice I am diagnosed w adhd. The doctor prescribed me meds. But I tried for so long and I have no motivation no matter what I d and everything from my life was pulled from me at once plus for some reason I developed a severe eating disorder and went through a period of being suicidal for like two weeks months back when this all started bc I tried for so long to get parents to listen and ufh",Fees,Medium,1.0,web:reddit:r/college:search:unfair grading,Medium,1,4187,846,7,Would I be able to get fasfa after starting college and taking a year off.,0
"Rule changes to the sub, and some other new announcements. Hello everyone! Now that summer is well and truly on its way out, college admissions are heating up for real. And with that, the other moderators and I thought it was time for some changes around here. So without further ado, here is a list of the proposed changes we will be making. We would love your feedback. - **Shitpost policy change:** This is the most major change - there will be no more shitposts, meme posts, or any other non-serious posts allowed EXCEPT for on Wednesday. We have received many complaints about the memes/shitposts clogging the sub and making it less friendly to new/infrequent users, and us mods agree. However, we didn't want to kill this aspect of the sub entirely, so now there is a designated day for them. We may allow them two days a week *if* the demand is strong enough. Also, we will probably allow them again sometime after either apps have been submitted or decisions have been released. - **Crackdown on rule 4:** There will be a crackdown on rule 4, which says to use descriptive titles. Descriptive titles help everyone, and posts that do not have them will start to be removed. Please report posts that do not use descriptive titles. - **Megathreads:** We will be creating megathreads for many universities and colleges when decisions are released, including ED and EA. Any post talking about being accepted/denied from a college that has a megathread will be deleted and the user will be directed to the appropriate megathread. We will also try to do this for other big events, such as fly-in program decisions, and national merit announcements. - **FAQ/wiki section and easily answered questions:** We are in the process of editing the FAQ/wiki section of this sub. It will be linked at the top of the sub, as well as in the sidebar, for some time. Posts that ask repetitive/easily answered questions, such as ""How to improve my ACT?"" or ""Essay advice?"" will be deleted and sent to the wiki/FAQ page. - **Meta flair:** Creation of a ""Meta Discussion"" flair post. For meta discussion regarding the sub and its workings. This has already been added. **We welcome feedback on all of these new rules!** As it stands, the shitpost policy will probably take effect on Monday, and the rest We ask you to please starting reporting shitposts then if it's not Wednesday! Also, if you have any other suggestions for rules that should change, please don't hesitate to comment your suggestions",Faculty,Low,0.0,web:pullpush:r/ApplyingToCollege:submission:complaint,Low,0,2485,428,6,"Rule changes to the sub, and some other new announcements.",0
"I might also get downvoted - but in my opinion, some people in that income range deserve to complain to some extent. ~200K income is NOT “super rich”, especially depending on where you live (NY or Cali, for instance). These people are definitely privileged, but the types of opportunities at rich feeders is truly, significantly different. Look at Harvard - a good portion of the Harvard undergrad class comes from only like 7 or so rich feeder schools. People in lower income brackets definitely face struggles, I’m not trying to diminish that all. In my opinion though, the ~200K income bracket faces a different but valid set of struggles than those in lower income brackets. They don’t have the opportunities that rich private school kids have, and they also don’t get the “low income” consideration that is said to supposedly boost college apps. They’re just kind of in the middle. Referencing your post, compared to rich feeders they really are disadvantaged.

"Roommate wakes up at sunset and sleeps at sunrise. I'm a freshman in college and my roommate's sleep schedule really pisses me off. He wakes up late in the evening around 4pm and then he goes to sleep between 5 and 7am. I, having a normal sleep schedule, wake up around 7am and go to sleep around 11pm. I've had a conversation with them about me making noise when they're asleep because it wouldn't be fair for me to be quiet during the day. He said it's fine and they'll deal with it but even then, I don't feel fully comfortable in my room when he's sleeping during the day. My other problem is that because he usually sleeps during the day, I don't get much free time to myself. I already don't like not having my own space, and now I also don't have alone time since he doesn't leave until 7pm after he wakes up usually. It was better at the beginning of the school year but his sleep schedule eventually got to the point where it is right now and it's genuinely driving me crazy. He told me about how his grades aren't doing great because he is skipping his classes and I offered to start waking them up everyday at 11am. When I did try to wake him up he just got annoyed at me for trying to wake him up, saying it's too early. I'm just thinking how I can't help someone who doesn't want to be helped but at the same time I still need to live with his issues affecting me. I just feel kind of hopeless with our schedule differences. For reference he has mentioned being depressed sometimes, which I completely understand and resonate with, but that doesn't fully excuse allowing yourself to have such a messed up sleep schedule. He also said that he's always slept in very late and had a lot of tardies in high school and his mom usually forced him to get up, so it's not like this is new either, though obviously more extreme. He's a nice person but his sleep schedule makes me resent him and I don't understand how people just sleep during the day like that during college.

"I think that you, like me, come from a place of a great privilege and experience ( which you don't have to apologize for, but a little empathy would be nice ). Not everyone goes to schools where the teachers are experienced or highly trained or even degreed. Not everyone has parents or mentors who encourage personal growth and outside learning, or even teach you to plan for the future or give a crap. And even the people who do have some of those things may have some hidden passion or talent that until they're introduced may never surface, all because their good school had a bad teacher in one subject or their parents disapproved of a specific field. The system already favors people like you and me who have a plan, excelled in high school, are prepared and perform well in college, and have been preparing for years. I took a bunch of AP courses and got college credit, letting me have a lighter core load, which let me get better grades, which let me get full tuition scholarships six of seven semesters, and let me get high paying, high profile internships, and graduate debt-free with a job offer in hand. Along the way, some of my favorite courses were outside of my major including an expository writing course that actually challenged me to become a better writer and do real research on a topic, even after performing well in high School courses and placement exams and an intro to economics course that very nearly convinced me to change my major while teaching me how to understand the interconnected global and cultural effects of every decision financial, political, and professional. In the end, the amount of breadth were asked to take part in in college serves as a great basis for those who don't have one, an opportunity for greater diversity and networking for those who do have the foundation, and really isn't that great of a burden or a delay for those who already have a plan",Academic,Medium,1.0,web:pullpush:r/college:comment:scholarship delay,Medium,1,1905,339,0,"I think that you, like me, come from a place of a great privilege and experience ( which you don't have to apologize for, but a little empathy would be nice ).",0

"Is a time-consuming data science internship really important for AI/ML master’s admissions if I already have strong academic background and competitive programs. Hi everyone, I’m planning to apply for master’s programs abroad in AI, machine learning, or statistics or other related fields. I have a GPA of 91/100. I have been selected &amp; participated in several government-funded AI/ML programs partnered with organizations like Sigma Software, Oracle, and Harbour.Space University, outside my university. Now, I have the chance to do a 3-month full-time data science internship. The problem is: The first two months are mostly bootcamp basics (Python, SPSS statistics) plus unrelated administrative office work. Real hands-on projects might only happen in the last month. The internship schedule (9am–6/9pm, plus long commute) would leave almost no time to prepare for the IELTS exam, and would make it really uncomfortable for me to prepare for the test. Given my situation, would this internship significantly strengthen my application for AI/ML master’s programs and would it worth those trade-offs, or would I be better off focusing on building my own AI/ML projects and preparing thoroughly for the IELTS?

"At My Lowest Point In Life. First and foremost, I'm sorry for the dramatic title. I don't post on reddit a lot, and that's honestly what just came to my mind first. I am just so fucking lost in life right now. I am about to graduate with a EE major that I despise. I despise it because it's not even something I'm remotely passionate about. All my life I had only been doing what I thought was expected of me, and never really spent time thinking about what I was interested in. Ever since I established myself as ""academically intelligent"" to my peers AND to my parents, I felt the need to maintain it for them. My parents had always told me that the only thing I had to focus on is school. For one, they wanted me to qualify for scholarships to go to uni because they didn't have the money to financially support me, and they evidently didn't want me taking out loans. As parents, they wanted their kid to be in a better financial state than what they were in at the time. Back then and until this day I recognize all this and appreciate them for wanting what they thought was best for me. To me, it meant that I needed to be perfect. I had to minimize risks, avoid making mistakes, strive for a financially sound career. Thinking about what I would truly be interested in felt like a waste. My attitude was to come to school, do what I needed to do while minimizing conversations with my peers and teachers, and go home expecting to do the same thing tomorrow. I pursued engineering back in high school not only because it seemed like the smart and safe route, but because that's what my closest friends at the time were pursuing. I took several AP and AICE classes for college credit, and all of this helped me get a full ride to college. I got Summa Cum Laude by the time I graduated and I didn't even know I had been working towards it. It never even really set in when I had graduated high school. I felt nothing about the fact that this chapter of my life was coming to an end. I was so numb to it all; the idea that I would potentially never see many of my friends, peers, and teachers should've sadden me like it did for most. But it didn't. I didn't join ANY clubs, I didn't go to ANY events, I didn't do anything that I would've remotely liked. For the longest time, I thought I hated high school because I thought my high school was shit. Now that I know that it was ME, I'm the reason why my experience was so shit. And guess what's fucked up about all this? I DID IT ALL AGAIN. I RUINED MY COLLEGE EXPERIENCE! I went to a college which albeit a good one it wasn't my first choice. I got ACCEPTED to my first choice college, but I quickly buckled after my parents told me it wasn't a good idea because it was upstate and I would've had to dorm and figure out living expenses by myself! I entered college as an engineering major, because, why not? I was in the engineering academy in high school and even though I hated it, well, where else was I suppose to go? And, why electrical engineering you may ask? Well, I WAS initially majoring biomedical engineering because that's what *I told* my friends, teachers, and family that I'd do *when asked* and I later decided that I didn't like the program! I had discovered by that time in my collegiate life that I was interested in physics. So, I told my advisor that I wanted to switch to mechanical, and they said I it was a bad idea because ***they believe*** I wouldn't be accepted because it would delay my 4-year graduation timeline. Thus, they suggested electrical engineering, and rather than fight it I said OK! Sure! If you say so! AND I ENDED UP TAKING 5 YEARS ANYWAY BECAUSE OF MY MENTAL HEALTH! YET AGAIN I didn't join any clubs. YET AGAIN I didn't go to any events. YET AGAIN I didn't make any long lasting connections. And now I'm learning that all this academic work I put forth means squat because it truly is not just what you know but who you know. Despite my high GPA and my classes, I am struggling to get into INTERNSHIPS. I don't have any work experience whatsoever or any relevant club activities or personal projects because all I did was focus on was school! I was suppose to be the person deemed capable of having it all figured out. Well, I wasn't. All I did was go with the flow of things, I never fought the current. I am a fraud, I'm not as smart as people think I am. I am pathetic, passionless, and a coward. I should've never entered college without some sort of idea or plan on what I truly wanted to do. At this point, I'm am the lowest I've ever been. I want to disappear in the eyes of everyone I know and start anew, so that I can stop using the excuse of having to meet these fabricated, external expectations and take a hard long look at what is that I really want to do with my life. If I am able to, for once in my life, be 100% confident with what I want to pursue, part of me wants to give undergrad another try. Only this time I'll have to take out loans for it and pretty much squander not only the years I've spent but also the one advantage that I had which was being able to graduate college debt free. But at least, now I know how NOT to go about college. I have heard that I could work towards a master's different from my bachelor's, but I can't even fucking think of anyone who I made an impression on that would be willing to write me a letter of recommendation as I didn't even go to any of my professors' office hours. I wish I hadn't been afraid of trying things at the risk of feeling like I would fail my classes, my friends, and my family. //TLDR: I ruined my college experience, I don't even like the career that I am positioned to set out on, I'm not proud of a single ""accomplishment"" of mine, I am mentally unwell about it all and don't know what to do",Faculty,Medium,1.0,web:pullpush:r/college:submission:scholarship delay,Medium,1,5775,1109,6,At My Lowest Point In Life.,0

Research Project Management Systems: • Adaptation: Use CMS-like platforms (e.g., OpenProject, Zotero with project management plugins, or custom solutions) to manage research projects. These would track milestones (e.g., experiment deadlines, publication submissions), assign tasks to team members, and integrate with academic calendars. • Benefits: Centralizes project data, reduces missed deadlines, and clarifies responsibilities across multidisciplinary teams (e.g., a bioinformatics project involving computer scientists and biologists). • Example: A physics lab could use a CMS to track grant proposal deadlines, experiment schedules, and publication timelines, with automated reminders for peer reviews. 2. Document and Data Management: • Adaptation: Implement a DMS tailored for MINT, such as LabArchives or Figshare, to store research papers, datasets, code, and lab notes. Metadata tagging (e.g., project ID, research topic) and search functionality would enable quick retrieval. • Benefits: Ensures version control for collaborative manuscripts or codebases, reduces data loss, and supports reproducibility. Secure storage aligns with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR for EU-funded research). • Example: A chemistry department could use a DMS to organize spectra data, experimental protocols, and safety sheets, accessible to authorized researchers only. 3. Time and Resource Tracking: • Adaptation: Adopt time-tracking tools (e.g., Toggl, Harvest) to monitor time spent on research, teaching, and administrative tasks. Integrate with grant management systems to allocate resources efficiently. • Benefits: Improves transparency for funding agencies, optimizes researcher workloads, and supports equitable task distribution in collaborative projects. • Example: A computer science team developing AI algorithms could track time spent on coding, testing, and documentation to justify grant expenditures. 4. Collaboration Platforms: • Adaptation: Use tools like Microsoft Teams, Slack, or Notion for real-time communication and task coordination among MINT researchers, students, and external partners. Shared repositories (e.g., GitHub for code, Overleaf for papers) enhance collaborative output. • Benefits: Streamlines communication across geographically dispersed teams, supports interdisciplinary collaboration (e.g., engineers and mathematicians on a robotics project), and reduces email overload. • Example: A materials science team could use Slack channels for daily updates on experiments and GitHub for sharing simulation code. 5. Standardized Research Workflows: • Adaptation: Develop standardized protocols for common MINT tasks, such as experimental design, data analysis, or peer review. Templates for grant proposals, ethics applications, or lab reports can be stored in a knowledge management system. • Benefits: Reduces onboarding time for new researchers, ensures consistency in methodology, and accelerates project initiation. • Example: A biology department could create templates for CRISPR experiment protocols, ensuring compliance with biosafety regulations. 6. Knowledge Management Repositories: • Adaptation: Build centralized repositories (e.g., using Confluence or institutional wikis) to store research findings, methodologies, and teaching materials. Encourage contributions from faculty and students. • Benefits: Prevents knowledge loss when researchers leave, supports interdisciplinary learning, and accelerates literature reviews. • Example: A mathematics department could maintain a wiki with solved problem sets, proof techniques, and open conjectures, accessible to students and faculty. 7. Compliance and Data Security: • Adaptation: Implement secure cloud storage (e.g., ownCloud, Box) and access controls to protect sensitive research data, such as clinical trial results or proprietary algorithms. Regular training on data ethics and compliance (e.g., IRB requirements,“xml IRB = Institutional Review Board “) ensures adherence to regulations. • Benefits: Mitigates risks of data breaches, ensures compliance with funding agency requirements, and builds trust with collaborators. • Example: A neuroscience lab could use encrypted storage for fMRI data, with access restricted to authorized researchers. Challenges and Considerations • Cost: Law firm systems often involve expensive software licenses. MINT departments could leverage open-source alternatives (e.g., OpenProject, Zotero) or negotiate institutional licenses. • Adoption: Faculty and students may resist new systems due to learning curves. Training programs and user-friendly interfaces are critical. • Customization: MINT research varies widely (e.g., theoretical math vs. experimental physics). Systems must be flexible to accommodate diverse workflows. • Interdisciplinary Integration: MINT projects often involve external partners (e.g., industry, other universities). Systems should support secure, controlled data sharing",Examination,High,2.0,web:pullpush:r/academia:comment:problem,High,2,5325,702,5,"I am a little bit lazy, but Grok helped me to briefly summarize it: Implementing Law Firm Systems in MINT Academia MINT disciplines involve complex research projects, interdisciplinary collaboration, and administrative t",0

"Need advice or a time turner. I’m currently in my third semester in grad school. This has been my first semester as a Communication major (switched from Sustainability). Good news with the switch is I like my major a lot better and it actually is built for non traditional students- classes are in the evenings instead of smack in the middle of the work day. But the issue now is having classes I want to take over lap. I desperately want to take an art class with a specific prof (and my advisor agrees this would be beneficial for me) but it seems every class is either a Monday or Wednesday evening! I have asked if there is any chance the times may switch, and that is a no. My advisor and said prof suggested attending the undergrad version of the class but following the grad syllabus but that is twice a week and in the middle of the day. My current plan was to graduate this summer so I can’t wait for these classes to come around again. Besides being good classes to help me in a future career, I really want to make connections with these profs and my classmates.

"Drexel's Music industry vs CCM's Sound design. I’m an international student trying to choose between two very different college programs, and I could really use some honest advice. I’ve been accepted to Drexel University’s Music Industry program and the University of Cincinnati’s Sound Design program at the College-Conservatory of Music. Both gave me decent scholarships, so cost of attendance comes down to about $58K/year at Drexel and $35K/year at CCM. Drexel’s program is more focused on the business and tech side of the music industry. It has a co-op program that seems like a great way to get work experience, although I found out that less than half of those co-ops are actually paid. The nice thing is that students can take courses in both the business and production track, so there will be more career outcomes (producers, recording engineers, artist managers, record label executives, etc). And since it’s in Philly, I imagine there are more networking opportunities in the city. CCM is one of the top conservatories for theatre and music. It's is much more specialized in sound design for theater and live performance. It’s super hands-on and also has a co-op program, but I couldn’t find much info on whether those placements are usually paid. My main hesitation is that it’s really focused on theater—so I’m not sure if that limits me later on if I want to branch out into other parts of the music industry. Also, I’m wondering how the salary and job security look in the theater world compared to broader music roles. I’m trying to think long-term here: which path is more likely to lead to stable job opportunities and decent pay? Is it safer to go for a general music industry degree, or is the more niche sound design route better because there’s less competition? That’s just me guessing though, feel free to correct me if I'm way off. Also, since I’m an international student, I’m wondering if that makes things harder in terms of finding jobs after graduation in either field.

"How do you deal with accidental plagiarism when writing. Pulling multiple sources to communicate a consensus with appropriate quoting, then using that as a basis for an original conclusion is pretty advanced writing. But it is a skill you'll need for college level academic writing. I think it's fine to quote when necessary - just paraphrasing is plagiarism if you don't cite the source. At that point, just quote the writer and cite. The conclusion should be your original thought. For example, let's say the prompt is: What is the best ice cream flavor? In this made up example, I would write something like: [Jones et. al found in 2006 that chocolate was favored by 6 out 10 children. Chocolate also seems to increase happiness when consumed compared to vanilla (Smith, 2020; Allen, 2018; Matthews, 2016). In her book History of Ice Cream, Julie Davis writes, ""Among all the flavors of ice cream, chocolate stands tall as the king."" While the question of best mainly comes down to personal preference, mounting evidence cannot be ignored. Multiple sources point to chocolate as the preferred choice across the population. When we all scream for ice cream, we scream for chocolate.] My contribution is the answer to the prompt. I did not run the research myself, my answer is built on others' work. So I cite and credit the authors.

"I’m concerned about the curriculum quality in my psych class, but can’t tell if it’s worth doing anything about. I hope this is the right place for this kind of post, I wasn’t sure where else to go. I apologize if not. I’m a first year psychology student, trying to earn my associates degree. I’m in a psychology of adjustment class currently, and the curriculum is driving me nuts. Should I just lay my head low and do the work without complaining? Maybe- but it’s making me feel crazy. The textbook itself- which was very expensive- wasn’t written by a psychologist. It was written by a home economics professor. Her co writer’s credentials (as far as I can tell) was a book she’d written about burning baby fat off and how to make epoxy art. Why am I looking up their credentials? Because the claims in this book are wild. Along with random anecdotes from “Debbie who’s husband left her”, (I’m not kidding that’s straight from the book as a source,) there’s just so many quotes from random celebrities that have nothing to do with anything. Like why is Vanessa Hudgens giving me insight into long distance relationships in my psychology textbook? Furthermore, there are insane statistics, such as “50% of the world is chronically depressed, and everyone in their life will experience depression.” Saying that getting a divorce will cause you to seek validation in gangs (not your child, you, the person who got a divorce.) as well as giving generalizations of people based on their culture. And that’s just a few things wrong with this book. My professor also wanted me to watch and take note of a video made by actualized.org- also not a psychologist. I’ve looked into Leo Gura before, and truthfully I don’t think any of his spiritual philosophy videos should be taken as fact. Honestly, I think he’s rather cult like. So what do I do?

"Am being graded unfairly, what do I do. A student who’s about to graduate is my TA for a class. I cant post to my school page in fear he’ll see it. But he added me on Facebook (didn’t add any other students) and I accepted the request thinking it was harmless, since I am friends with some of my old teachers on fb. But right after accepting his request he messaged me saying hi. I ignored it. Then after class he messaged me again, and this time I responded but was very dry and abrupt. He got the message and I thought it would be okay from there. Flash forward to a few days later, when he made a post saying that he was graduating soon. Many people commented saying congrats to him, and I was still in his class so I thought it’d be a nice gesture to comment congrats. He took it in the wrong way and thought I wanted to talk more. He then messaged me again and asked for my number, to which I said no. The next day in class he was very cold towards me, he kept criticizing the fact that I wasn’t doing any work.

"Article Processing Fees - Help. Hi yall! I just submitted an article to an online journal that’s pretty reputable.

"Game Changing ai math tool now free forever. Hey everyone, For a limited time, you can secure lifetime access to a premium ‘photomath’ type ai math solver iOS app, originally priced at $129.99, for absolutely $0.00. To be completely transparent, I am the developer behind this math solver tool. However, I stand to gain nothing from this financially; the app is ad-free, and I'm covering all costs per new user out of pocket. So I’m hoping this doesn't seem like self-promotion; I'm simply trying to share this photomath app that’s usually paid but now free with people who would really benefit from something like this. So why now? Because I’m moving on to bigger and better things and want to celebrate the final week I acticley work on this app. The tool is very simple to use yet powerful. Just scan your math problem and it will instantly give you the solution with step-by-step workings to show how to get there. It can handle algebra, calculus, some geometry, word-based problems, statistics, probability, derivatives and much more. The app also includes a GPT 4.0 chatbot which in itself is $20 / month usually but right now it’s free forever. The app will remain on the store, so you can use these tools for as long as you need them. As mentioned above, this is a limited offer and the lifetime price will return to $129.99 in a couple days.

"First, I've been on many hiring committees as well. I've heard faculty on the committee explicitly say ""I'd like to interview X because we need more women/URM/etc in the department."" There's also a lot of backdoor pressure from the Dean, department chair, etc., to make sure we have a ""diverse"" department, even if that means hiring less qualified applicants. To pretend that's not true is disingenuous. To many faculty members social good is more important that meritocracy, or they'll argue that the meritocracy based on publications/grades/scores is fundamentally unfair because of the different difficulties people have in life. The net result is the same. They end up hiring people who are objectively less qualified, because of a protected characteristic. I don't quite get your second point.

I’m honestly writing this in a state of deep distress and anger, and I don’t know where else to turn right now. I need help, resources, people I can talk to, guidance, anything. I’m a student at a U.S. university and recently gave my capstone presentation, which I had worked on for weeks. My topic was Palestine and the NEOM project in Saudi Arabia. I had emailed my professor ahead of time (March 27) to let them know this was my subject. What happened in class that day has left me completely shaken and disgusted. The professor arrived late, chatted casually with another student, then gave a “warning” speech to the whole class about how we should be careful with our words and framing—because a Zionist Israeli student had cried in his office before class. It was very clear that this was directed at me and my topic. I was then told to wait an extra 5 minutes before starting. Once I began presenting, she kept telling me to “wrap it up,” didn’t let me show any of the videos I had prepared, and cut me off—even though class ended early and I had more than enough time. No one else was treated this way. Her tone toward me was rude and degrading. Classmates have since reached out saying they noticed how differently he treated me. And yet, in a separate class, another student said, without challenge, that “Hamas hides under all civilian infrastructure ""to justify Israeli airstrikes. That blatant propaganda was left unchecked. But I wasn’t even allowed to say the word “genocide.” This professor claims to specialize in genocide studies. Yet I was silenced for naming the ongoing genocide in Gaza. I didn’t cry. I didn’t weaponize my identity. I came in with facts, urgency, and care. And I was treated like a threat—because someone else’s tears were more important than Palestinian lives. I’ve decided I won’t be attending that class anymore. I’ll finish the assignments so I can pass, but I won’t sit through more of this. Still, I feel erased, isolated, and targeted. And I’m scared of retaliation if I speak out publicly.

"Is it appropriate to ask for letters of rec after two years. Hello friends, Recently the grad school program I have been looking at for a while has changed their requirements, meaning that I now meet the requirements as I am today rather than having to take several more exams and certifications, yay right? Well, one of the changes made is that it now requires 3 letters of recommendation, it can be anyone which should be easy, except for a few things. I do have a few professors who either went out of their way to offer a letter of recommendation, or who had previously written me a letter for something else but it's been more than 2 years since I've interacted with them. Would it be inappropriate for me to reach back out, re-introduce myself and provide a resume as well as a ""hey this is who I was, this was my impact on your class, this was your offer"" and ask for a letter? For more context, I'm unable to get a letter professionally due to my current job field. My current job has some weirdly strict policies around providing references and letters of recommendation, it's due to how often auditors change companies and attempting to keep people in their role, among some personal issues I've had at work. I haven't done anything wrong, some changes were just made at the company which resulted in me never working with the same manager/senior for more than one or two projects in the last year. Also, another question is the context of the letters. I'm going to be applying for a cybersecurity program, but due to the pandemic most of our cybersecurity professors went online and then never really returned. Because of that, except for the professor who oversaw my senior project, I didn't really develop a strong rapport with most of them.

"uw reject, nyu admit; should I transfer. last year, I received the most humbling college decision of my life, which was getting rejected from my state school, uw-seattle. I applied as a public health/pre-sciences major, and, after getting into some of my targets/reaches like UC davis/irvine/San Diego, Boston university, uiuc, Purdue, northeastern, etc, I was denied admission from UW. then I was admitted to nyu, and that is where I currently go. im not here to say that I deserved to get into uw or anything, I'm just setting up the backstory. im at nyu rn for for premed, but ever since coming here, ive thought that perhaps it wasn't worth it. I wasn't about to drop 400k for undergrad for a degree that I couldn't do much with if I didn't get into med school. im lucky enough that my parents are paying the full sticker price with no complaints, but I also feel bad. the pre health professors are bad and the tuition is also crazy. however, nyu is really good for business, so I tried to take a couple of classes, but tbh, Idk if Im interested business at all. because of this, I feel like I shouldn't be spending so much money on nyu to not even be in the business school. I feel like the only reason I'm at nyu is because I got rejected from uw, which is kinda a funny statement. if I went to uw, I feel like I would probably have felt more pressure to do premed (just like how I feel pressured to do business at nyu). but now that im at nyu, unsure about my career, I don't know if it's worth it to maybe transfer back to uw. I was looking into their informatics major which seems interesting, and it's something that nyu doesn't have (nyu only has cs/data sci). rn, im considering switching to something tech-related at nyu, but at that point, I feel like I should just transfer to uw. overall, I feel like uw is better in general for premed and tech students, and because I'm on the fence between the two, I feel like I should just transfer back. I feel like I should only go to nyu for business, and obviously I'm not in that. im not unhappy at nyu and ive met some really cool people, but im also incredibly lost. I don't know if it's worth it, though, regarding credits, applying into a capacity-constrained major, making new friends, starting fresh, etc. please give insight, thanks",Faculty,Medium,1.0,web:pullpush:r/ApplyingToCollege:submission:complaint,Medium,1,2297,424,6,"uw reject, nyu admit; should I transfer.",0

"at my institution, orgo is much more about conceptual understanding. for example, a majority of the semester is spent talking about mechanisms of reactions, and one of the most important questions is basically ""why do the electrons move where they do?"" even if you forget the specifics of a reaction, often times it wasn't too crazy trying to piece together a plausible (partial credit) response. a lot of orgo was vibes and memorizing structures, naming conventions, and the like. it shouldn't have an calculus at all if your course is anything like mine was. at my institution, the physics classes are mostly lectures about how we can derive these formulas, and then practice/homework/exams. we had some calculus (basic differentiation or maybe a little integration), but most of the course was built on basic formulas, how they were derived, how they could be related, ect. i wasn't a huge fan, because often times our instructors seemed to assume some level of familiarity with physics that i simply didn't have. idk if that helps at all, but i do both chem and physics. it can be really cool to see how they are related, especially once you get to non-classical physics. it can be a slog for sure, but it was always interesting",Academic,Medium,1.0,web:pullpush:r/college:comment:exam,Medium,1,1232,211,0,"at my institution, orgo is much more about conceptual understanding.",0

"Plans for Rampant AI - Fall 2025. Hi Everyone! I like many of us read the NY Magazine article with frustration. Let me know if anything below is too far to implement in a class of 95+. It's what I'll try to communicate when I rationalize the new moves next semester: ✅ Maintain in-person, paper exams. It takes a lot longer to grade, but it establishes trust that the work is done for those looking at the value of a degree (employers, postgrad schools, and the public). ✅ Shift all formative class writings/projects to 100% on paper. The act of writing itself is an inherently human connection to thinking. Simply put by Fareed Zakaria in his book on education, writing is thinking. ✅ Maintain in-person lectures, labs, office hours, and open review hours to foster student community and collaboration. ✅ Maintain integrity in the classroom, which means citing and following through on dishonesty. This one isn't pretty, as a lot of us in this sub have found out when we need to do the right thing and pursue it. ✅ (and here's a tough one) Limit computers, iPads, and potentially phones in lecture. The amount of effort to pull this off in a 95-person class like mine is daunting, and I don't know if it's possible in larger classes without help. ✅ Maintain rigorous curriculum and assessment paired with evidence-based support structure/strategies. ✅ Here's where things get tricky: managing and graphing data. One of my core tenants is data literacy, even so long as it's Excel proficiency after our 200-level Genetics lab. The hands-on lab would strangely be the space with open computers. CAVEATS: Not every change is possible across the board, nor does it fully confront some of the driving issues that higher ed must address, namely that college should be a journey of intellectual exploration &amp; growth, not an uncivil rat race for +4% on an assignment. Tough times often circle around that all-important GPA, but removing grades would open up its own can of worms (maybe another conversation for later). Equally, in-person classes and circumstances don't work for everyone all the time, so obviously there will be custom approaches for different situations. Thank you for reading. I have heavily relied on this sub for teaching advice, staying sane in the face of strange issues, and just knowing that there are others out there.

"I need advice on handling this situation because I'm so lost. I am attending an online school. It's 100% online, no campus stuff. I was doing great for the first year and a half or so (all classes A's and Bs). In September I was put in a class where I knew due to physical limitations I would not be able to complete the final assignment. On day one of that class I contacted the professor privately and told him the problem and why it was a problem. Which he ignored. He kept telling me ""no exceptions do the work"". I was trying to tell him I can't do the work it's not possible but no matter how I tried he just didn't listen. I contacted the school next (student advisor). They said that I had to contact the disability team or whatever runs the school so I could get a letter for my \*next\* class saying I'm disabled. I asked them how that would help me for this class which I can't do the assignment. They told me to ""worry about that later"". It took another few weeks just to jump through those hoops and get the disability letter. It was only after that point which they agreed to negotiate with the professor about this (and at that point I had failed the class). The professor's ""solution"" to this problem (and his only negotiation) was basically ""do the assignment the way I said or fail the class"". I mean seriously, I pointed out to him that the compromise he presented was posing the same exact problem as I had the first time around and wouldn't be possible and that, in actually, he hadn't compromised on anything. If you're wondering, I have offered several compromises myself that would be equivalent to the assignment and how I could get it done given my physical limitations but the school will not entertain this for some reason. I was put back in the class because before they even asked if the compromise was okay they just decided that I would be fine. I informed them, once again, immediately, that the conditions were not okay and I still could not do the assignment as the compromise didn't even address my issues in the first place and wasn't really even a compromise. I didn't get a response. Not wanting to fail again I started to do the assignments that I could do (like the written work and such) but anything I turned in the professor reported as ""inappropriate"" and I got an email about being sanctioned for my behavior. I asked them what I was supposed to do. I informed them already that I was not able to complete this class and I told them the first day of class when they told me what the ""compromise"" was. I go to log on to my student email to see if anyone has replied to anything I sent because it always takes them ages to do that for some reason and I find that I'm locked out of my account. I kept getting a note to contact tech support. Which I did. Tech support said the school locked me out of my account and I asked why. They said I was sent an email, to that account. I asked them how I was supposed to read that email if the school locked me out of the account. Yes, this seriously happened they locked me out of an account they sent an email to that I was supposed to respond to, I mean WTF? Finally after talking to three tech support people (and an hour on the phone) I got someone to forward the email to an email I'm not locked out of. They told me I'm being very unprofessional and that I'm suspended for.well I don't know how long. They just gave a random course number. One that I can't even check because I can't log into my account to see what day that is. They gave me an option to appeal but in order to appeal I have to log into my account which they locked me out of. I have called the school twice to try to get someone on the phone and every single time I'm told ""no one is available"" and that my call would be returned within 24 hours. No call back. At all. I've sent several emails and heard nothing back either. If I don't pass this class or I can't pass it because the professor refuses to compromise based on my physical limitations then I can't get this degree and I will be out tens of thousands of dollars in loans to take these classes in the first place. This is the first and only class in a year and a half where I've had any problem with anything or any teacher but now I'm screwed. They tell me I ""might"" get the chance to take the class a THIRD time but they are still unwilling to budge on the requirements no matter how hard I explain to them I can't meet them. In the end, I'm going to be forced to drop out of this school for a problem that I have no control over. I don't know what I'm supposed to do, I really need this degree and I worked hard for it. I was on the dean's list before this class for crying out loud. Now all this work was for nothing and I just have to give up? Is there anyone else I can contact I mean outside of the school? I already tried contacting the state educational board but they weren't very helpful. I filled a complaint to the college accreditation office or whatever that is and all they did was send a copy of my written complaint to the school on my behalf and the school has refused to respond to it. I really don't want to have to drop out but it seems like no one wants to compromise even a tiny bit to help me and I'm losing my mind over this.

For my morning classes, that means 2-4 hours after the start-of-class deadline; for my afternoon class, that means the hour right after class ends. In practice, Recently, one student who regularly misses journals from that afternoon class pointed out that her friend from the morning class missed her class deadline by an hour more and got it in. I repeated said policy, to which she said no fair. I'm annoyed at the whole thing-- frankly, just get it in on time--but I'm wondering if I should just forget about grace periods and make the policy class time, sharp for everyone.

"To your questions: 1. 20 pages is about the maximum I would assign per session for a freshman/sophomore class. However, when the reading is an academic article or book chapter, I generally don't assign anything else for that day so that students can focus on it. At the freshman/sophomore level, I lean heavily on journalistic articles and/or blog posts that reference the academic concepts we're studying, as these tend to be more digestible for a student audience. Perhaps you could replace some of your chewier articles with non-peer-reviewed publications written by the same scholars for a non-scholarly audience. 2. The main ""problem"" with this new generation and reading is not that they're different from ours but that they're the same: they respond to incentives. When I hear a professor complain about their students not reading, my first two questions are ""Do you reward them on an individual basis for reading?"" and ""Do you punish them on an individual basis for not reading?"" 90% of the time the answer to both questions is no. It's hard for many professors, drawn from the small stock of students who derived intrinsic enjoyment from reading research in their field, to recognize that most of their students don't share that intrinsic motivation. Yet those same professors won't show up to an important meeting or event on campus unless they're forced to be there or bribed with food and/or drink. We're all the same animal, responding to the same basic stimuli. What I've found works well for me (inspired by [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Flipped-Learning-Higher-Education-Faculty/dp/1620364328)) is pairing each reading or set of readings with an open-book, open-note, open-Internet online reading quiz, due one hour before class starts. I build this in Google Forms and ask students three or four open-ended questions, sometimes with a poll as well (e.g., ""Which of the two authors did you find more persuasive?""). These quizzes count for 15% of a student's overall grade, but they're graded lightly (full credit if it's clear you made a good-faith effort) and with the lowest *N* quiz scores dropped. This way, the quizzes are worth doing but not high-stakes. Crucially, I base the quiz questions on what the discussion topics will be for that day, so that when it comes time for discussion (which is worth yet another 15% of a student's overall grade) students have already formed some thoughts and can participate based on how they answered the quiz. This approach transformed my classes for the better, and faculty observers are consistently impressed with how engaged students are in discussions. Most professors I've talked about this at best begrudgingly accept the idea of rewarding students for reading, and they *definitely* don't like the framing of punishing students for not reading. But reward and punishment are two sides of the same coin, and most of us don't luck into a classroom full of intrinsically-motivated readers who will do it all simply for the life of the mind. If reading isn't already worth their while, the professor can either make it worth their while or accept that it probably won't happen",Faculty,Medium,1.0,web:pullpush:r/Professors:comment:problem,Medium,1,3145,512,6,To your questions: 1.,0

"Hi! I'm in desperate need of help or advice. A year ago, I committed academic dishonesty in my thesis, and it's killing me on the inside. It took me 9 months to realize that what I had done was not only wrong but also serious and brutal. What am I going to do. I am a fourth-year college student. Last year, I committed a terrible academic dishonesty by falsifying survey data for my thesis. Instead of responders in my area, I answered the majority of the questions on my own. The survey ended up presenting it as genuine, despite the fact that it was all fake. I did it because I have mental health issues that worsened when the worldwide epidemic hit. I've been dealing with depression since 2017, and my anxiety increased when I realized what I'd done was severe. I'm displaying signs of bipolar illness in the same year, but I am not clinically diagnosed because I've never seen a psychiatrist and couldn't afford it even if I wanted to. I've been a victim of bullying for a long time, and it's still a challenge for me. Since the outbreak, I've stayed home and seldom gone outside. I only go out when I have to go to school to pay my tuition and get my necessities. Staying indoors was and continues to be my best option for avoiding seeing others laughing at me when I walk even though I did nothing wrong to them and avoiding any negative behaviors/comments that can trigger me. Even though mental health matters and should be valued, I understand that it is not a justification for the dishonesty I committed. It is incredibly selfish, unprofessional, and immoral for a college student to engage in such behavior or dishonesty, and no school should accept this. I know what I did was terrible and horrifying. What I didn't comprehend or recall were the consequences, and how terrible and harsh they are. It took me 9 months to realize how bad this is. I read several articles/confessions/posts, and even watched videos on YouTube about ""academic dishonesty"" and it completely terrified me! I can't stop thinking about it, and it's been bugging me for months. I am hesitant to revise or bookbind my work with outcomes that are not entirely accurate. I genuinely feel horrible and bad now.and I know it's too late, and it took months for my conscience to do what is ethical, moral, and right. I received a good grade that I did not deserve. I received the grade by unethical means. It still bothers me every day and every time. This could tarnish not just only me and my reputation but also my school as well that I studied for a decade now &amp; the people involved as well. Here are my questions: a) What should I do if I ever get caught? Should I really come clean and confess to the people I decieved? Or is there anything that I can do before that? b) Is academic dishonesty goes to a student's transcript? Is it permanent or temporary? How long does it take to stay on the record? c) Is it possible for me to retake a thesis even though I passed? I want to retake it (just in case) to provide real and raw statistics and information on my work, not to outdo/improve my grade or anyone else's. I genuinely do not deserve the grade I received, and I am scared to modify or bookbind my work once this is over. d) If I ever given a chance to redeem myself again. Is it possible to revoke my work and do another one again? The survey data results, findings, conclusions, and recommendations are the only things that aren't real on my paper. I did worked hard on the first three chapters on my paper. I used Quillbot &amp; Grammarly to help me improve the sentences I made and also the grammar. e) Is there hearing for students who committed academic dishonesty, especially here in the Philippines? f) Can the school press charges against a student who committed this kind of act? g) Should I appeal nor write an appeal letter to the school? h) I got advice from my previous reddit post and also to my friends. Some of them are really helpful, but most of them scared me. I got advices like ""you are lucky no one knew"", ""you are going to move pass on this one just don't tell to anyone what you did"", ""you're safe. you'll be fine just shut up."" but my issue is.what if people really found out? What if this was published on a library and found out that the survey data results aren't real? There are some students in my school who lived the same address/place as me, including a teacher.

"Maybe the person you're replying to has more insight into UCLA norms than I have, but 2 hours of work per hour out of class for a lecturer or teaching track faculty member is not consistent with my experience. That might be what research faculty put in to a course, but research faculty are evaluated on research, teaching, and service (generally in that order). So the expectations of their teaching are understandably different from the expectations on lecturers and teaching staff, for whom teaching is the whole gig. Similarly, research faculty often get some ancillary support from teaching staff that help them reduce their teaching hours (e.g., training TAs). Teaching track staff and faculty are generally expected to always be working to improve their teaching--there is no class that can't be made better or updated in some way. So there should still be prep work to some extent, even if previous year's teaching materials exist. Additionally, they are often expected to train and mentor the TAs--which, if _actually done well_, can be very time intensive. And just because there are TAs doesn't mean the lecturers aren't also expected to hold office hours, meet with students individually about their accomodations, act as liaison if students are raising concerns or complaints about their TAs, etc. This estimate also doesn't count meetings and emails, and one should never underestimate academia's ability to send emails and hold meetings. The meetings teaching staff faculty are expected to attend will also likely different then for faculty, and include an expectation to participate in repeat professional development. _Could_ the class be taught on 500 total hours? Maybe, but IMHO any lecturer doing that would hopefully be receiving some pretty substantial criticism when it comes time for their evaluation/review. It's not doing the job well and, if sustained over time, may result in contracted lecturers not having their contracts renewed. Also how reasonable $70k is will depend heavily on local cost of living. I'd be surprised if LA isn't a relatively high COL. And the lecturer is in physics--i don't agree with this, but lecturers are often paid differently depending on field. Usually physics would be near the higher end. And you have to remember that academic faculty and teaching staff are often paid on salary, and the institutions exert some influence over if you can subsidize that salary with external involvement. It's not uncommon to have to disclose and receive approval for any income from other sources. So if they ARE paying him $70k for 500 hours work, and $70k isn't sufficient to live on, it doesn't matter so matter that it's ""only"" 500 hours if he doesn't have much control over using the extra time to make additional income. That all said, I'm not trying to make a claim that $70k is or isn't reasonable--i don't have enough info to really say for sure.

"Dress advice for first time TA? (trans, visible religious minority, close in age to students). Hello! I'm going to be starting my Masters next semester, and the program I'm most likely to attend offered me a guaranteed TA-ship which covers my tuition (still waiting to hear from one more program, but happy with the offers I have and the $$ makes this one especially appealing). I come from a family of teachers and love public speaking and leading discussions, so I'm actually pretty excited even though I've heard how much being a TA can suck (and that a lot of it's monotonous grading). However, I am nonbinary (very old username lol, sadly still get gendered as a woman a lot), 22 years old, 5'2"", and wear a yarmulke full-time. I'm worried about getting taken seriously when I still get mistaken for a 16 year old from time to time. I frankly already dress pretty conservatively as a default, but how formally should I be dressing? I also know not to wear/bring anything politically provocative to class. I'm not going wear the jean jacket with all my pins I wear to protests in class or anything. But how far should I take this? Should I remove all my patches and pins from my bag before coming to class? Get a case to cover my laptop stickers? I'm trying to find the balance between not making a 'thing' out of my values in a way that's distracting or inappropriate but not overly erasing myself, especially because I remember how comforting it could be to see signals that my TAs or professors were supportive of (for example) my queer identity. I'd also love input from other trans TAs, or TAs who also wear distinctive religious/cultural dress about common issues and navigating those scenarios. I already get confusion about my pronouns from time to time, and I'm worried about it being a consistent issue with students. Since strangers on the street (and sometimes classmates) comment on my yarmulke unprompted, I wouldn't be surprised if that came up a fair bit as well.

"Professors and their exams [The dichotomy of finals: A rant]. My friend is in a social sciences Master's program, I am in a research STEM Master's program. We both have finals this week. So far I'm doing decently in my classes, and I'm far from needing to ace my finals to get a passing grade, but of course, I'm still begrudgingly studying because it's a thing I need to do. I've been studying for about 4 days now. My friend, on the other hand, studies one day for his finals. His profs tell him what's going to be on the exam (or at least, what's not going to be on the exam, which itself is a hefty amount). His profs hold review sessions that are very. enlightening and he has a large student body who is willing to share resources, like google docs, notes, etc. I hate that I'm stuck trying to memorize all this information for a class (not that it's not interesting, but just largely unrelated to my research), because I have profs who like to pick and choose the tiniest details to ask about on their exams. My profs aren't even here to answer questions (half of them are at conferences this week and aren't even in town), one of them even sprung a random lecture slide on us to study/memorize when he didn't even teach much less mention it to us. And for some reason, I'm that person who gets constantly excluded from things like emails (not to mention the clique structure within my program isolates a bunch of people) with cheat sheets, google docs, etc. So on top of having to do things on my own, I get to find out the day of the exam that a bunch of the things I tried to study or cram was simplified in a document and/or clarified by students, and I just didn't hear about it. I don't want to say I'm bitter, but I think it's just unfair how he basically gets ensured that he will get a good grade, or how his program and peers care more about everyone's success. I guess I'm just jealous right now and exhausted from this past term.

"First semester as a grad student. Is this normal? What can I do. Overall, I’m loving grad school and I know this is the place that I’m supposed to be, but one of my professors really seems to dislike me (or maybe I’m just paranoid) and it’s hard not to take it personally at this point. I’m going to be vague for the sake of anonymity in case anyone in my program is on here, so my apologies. This professor makes me feel so uncomfortable. The one time I went to his office hours he made me feel so uncomfortable, yelling at me to keep the door open in a hostile way (I never tried to close it) and asking me to leave 3 minutes into our conversation after continuously cutting me off when I tried to ask him questions. He had a meeting to go to (I had no idea since it was office hours). My mistake for assuming he was free during office hours, I guess. I have never had a professor made me feel like I had ill intentions visiting them (got the vibe he was afraid of sexual harassment claims) and I have never had a professor cancel office hours without announcing it. It was so odd. Next issue, professor often boasts about replying back to emails within 2 business days but he has ignored every one of mine. The first he ignored for 3 weeks, even after I followed up via email and in person. Eventually I gave up. The second was a simple question (yes/no question) that he ignored for 4 business days about test material for our midterm. He called me out in front of the class and said, “Oh yeah sorry I didn’t reply to your email, oh well.” My last and biggest issue is that I got my first graded assignment back. I asked if I could use X data for the assignment. He said I could. I got a B- on the assignment because you guessed it.I used X data when it was “inappropriate for the assignment.” As someone who has to maintain a 3.0 average to keep my TA job a B- is pretty bad for me and frankly I feel is unfair given the circumstance. This professor is extremely personable and enjoyable in lecture and people seem to generally like him, but outside of lecture and individually he’s an entirely different person towards me. It makes the situation that much more confusing for me. My other classmates I’ve spoken to haven’t had experiences like mine. Is this normal? Is there anything I should do differently? Part of me wants to fight to make my grades assignment readjusted given the miscommunication about the assignment expectations (it’s only worth 6% of my grade but I’m worried about this trend carrying on for future assignments). Part of me also wants to try to clear the air and apologize to him if I’ve done anything to upset him. Part of me thinks I should do nothing and just hope things will turn around, but this scares me since I have a lot on the line. Idk if this post will get any attention, but I just feel really uncomfortable around this professor so I guess it was at least nice to vent. Any comments appreciated. Thanks! Edit: I wanted to clarify that this is one of my professors NOT my advisor. We won’t be assigned an advisor until our second semester (right now we have a general one).

Additionally, I’m afraid of what my lackluster performance will mean for other, sooner applications, like internships.

"I am done, messed up my academics. Scored 95% in CBSE class 10th with standard maths and Hindi course A, and scored 88% in class 12th with PCB, English and Hindi. Was an all rounder in my school was the school vice captain in class 11th and school captain in class 12th. Not a teachers pet, but still liked by my teachers and principals because I was bright and had great leadership qualities and that time. And I never let anyone else win a debate or a speech or an elocution competition in my school, so basically I was very competitive and confident about my abilities. Long story short I somehow ended up choosing PCB and wanted to become a doctor but my coaching at Aakash institute went terribly wrong and my teachers at school kept changing. So my 11th and 12th grade were messed up. On top of that before my board exams, a day or two before them, before three subjects, there was a huge fight and drama going on in my house which was a result of 4 years drama and internal fights. With so much going on in my personal and academic life I still went on. Couldn't clear NEET in my first attempt so I took a drop because I did not know what to do. But I was just not able to study like I used to. It's not like I was distracted by Instagram reels or YouTube shorts, I do not even have Instagram, but I just couldn't study I used to sit there and stare at an empty wall, while thinking why the hell I was not able to study. I just couldn't come out of that loop. Seeing all this and seeing how I was as a student in my school days and keeping in mind that my English is pretty good, my BF suggested me to start preparing for IPMAT, instead of NEET. I did the same, and yes, I did think and discuss with my parents and to be honest my parents are pretty chill with all of my decisions. So I thought of preparing for IPMAT couple of days back. But the problem is I am a non math student and the competition is scaring me, plus I don't have any other good alternative. I don't want to end up doing a normal degree in a normal college, because that will eat me up alive and I will be keep on thinking about the student I was. My parents won't be mad at me, but they will be disappointed. More than that, I can never forgive MYSELF. Right now are financial condition is very bad, so can't even afford good coaching for IPMAT. With difficulty, managed to buy PW course for 5500 Rs., because I wanted something to start with. And the device I am studying in, is slowly deteriorating, the screen is not properly working, with ghost touches every single second and it is frustrating me to even type this.

She did not work hard once, she got poor marks in 10th, but through influence ended up in a good Pre University College for her 11th and 12th. But still scored below average marks, but that doesn't matter because she is going to be a doctor, and that is because she has money and I don't. It's not about me wanting to become a doctor, but it is just that it is so unfair that someone who worked hard couldn't get what someone with money did.

"I’m just wasting what’s suppose to be the best years of my life. So this is my last year of college, and I can’t help but look back on how it’s been for me. I never built real friendships, never made memories, never had those random hangouts that everyone else seems to have in college. Although, at the very start, I did have a group. For a couple of months, I used to sit with them. but I was more of a background character than anything else. Like half in the circle but not really part of it. Sometimes I’d try to contribute, throw in a comment here or there, but it never landed in a way that made me feel like I was actually inside the conversation. It wasn’t like they pushed me out or were mean to me, they were friendly enough. I just didn’t bring anything to the table and then, the new people in the group got more priority. Then one day I saw on social media that they were all hanging out, and I had this moment like, “what the hell am I even doing here? I don’t belong. I never did” After that, I just stopped talking to them, and they didn’t reach out to me either. I don’t really hold it against them, because honestly, I didn’t make the effort to fit in. A few months later, most of them removed me from their socials, and that was that. My “college friend group” ig it ended before it even began. After that, I just sat alone. Stopped trying to edge my way into conversations. And weirdly enough, I didn’t hate it. Sitting alone never really bothered me. I never felt cripplingly lonely, and sometimes it was even peaceful. It’s not like I completely shut people out either. Whenever someone in class talks to me, like asking about assignments or just random small stuff, I respond politely, usually with a smile. I’m not rude or dismissive. In fact, those little interactions are kind of nice. But it never really went deeper than small talk. Only for a minute or two. And just yesterday, I overheard a group of classmates making plans after class, laughing about where they should go. And that hit me harder than I expected. It made me realize that while I’ve had peace, I’ve also had emptiness. I don’t have a group to make plans with, no one to call up after class, no memories to look back on. College is not about just attending classesand getting a degree, it’s so much more than that For years, my routine has been the same. It’s just attending classes, the gym, and then gaming to pass the time. I make a own food and clean up my house because these are the things that give me structure, things I can control. And honestly, I do look forward to them. Gaming, the gym, deciding what I’ll make myself today. I mean, the most thought I usually put into a day is what I should cook when I’ll get home. And i think, at this stage of life, these shouldn’t be the only things I have to look forward to. The part I don’t usually admit to myself is that I tell myself I’m okay, and a lot of the time I am. But if I’m being completely honest, sometimes I feel lonely. Not the dramatic, crippling kind. More like a quiet, lingering kind of loneliness. I just wish there was someone, just one person, I could share these stretches of life with. Someone to grab food with, or to laugh with over something stupid. Few real memories to look back on, instead of just empty spaces where those moments should have been. And maybe that’s why I keep myself busy, because the busyness helps me push back against that quiet. And I already know people will say that the best years of your life are completely different for everyone and not everyone has the same kind of college experience. And I totally get that. But for me, this is literally the best time of my life right now. Because when I look at it, I have no tension, no drama, no financial stress, no family chaos weighing me down. I’m healthy, I’m young, I can wake up and decide how I want to spend my day. This kind of freedom and lack of responsibility is rare, and I know I’ll never get to live with this much ease again. If I’m not happy now then I don’t think i ever will be It’s just strange,yk. To have everything lined up so easily, no burdens and yet still feel like i missed out on something essential. I really appreciate the fact that my life is calm, that I’m lucky not to be carrying the weight others my age are forced to carry. I know it damn well that my future self asking why i didn’t at least try to give myself the chance to feel less alone",Transport,Medium,1.0,web:reddit:r/college:new,Medium,1,4427,842,21,I’m just wasting what’s suppose to be the best years of my life.,0

The best part is, if you don't share answers, you pretty much get dogged on for it.

"Am I crazy for thinking my roommate's behavior is unacceptable. *Please read the whole story if you can, but if not there is a TL;DR at the bottom. Thank you* I go to a small Liberal Arts College in the US, and I was born and raised in the US. My roommate is an international student from literally the opposite side of the globe, and this is his first time in the US. We've been in school for just over 2 months now, and some things he does has started to get on my nerves. I understand a lot of the complaints I will layout seem egregious, or even ridiculous, but I have the mindset that no I will go to great lengths not to inconvenience others and I wish to be treated in at least a similar manner. For example, he will often play music or watch videos from his speakers when he has not only earbuds but headphones as well. My headphones aren't great, and I can often hear whatever he is listening too unless I put my own pair on and even then it's not enough. I rarely use speakers, and only ever when the room is vacant. I do this to ensure that others in whichever room I am in, whether it's my dorm or a public location, aren't forced to listen to what I want or cover their ears. That entire thing is more of an irritant than anything else, and while there are a few other things he does that cause annoyance (not showering often, not cleaning his half of the room, never doing the trash etc.), I recognize that no-one is going to be perfect and there are certainly much worse behaviors a room-mate could partake in. To deal with much of this, I have begun to do the majority of my studying in vacant classrooms. Furthermore, I almost never come back to the dorm unless absolutely necessary. I'm more of an academic in the sense that I really care about my scholarly work and grades, while he has admitted to me that he really has no goal in college. This establishes that we have fundamentally different objectives in college. However, the activity that I have suffered from the most recently seems to cross the line in my opinion, and I'm looking for feedback as my thinking may not be entirely coherent after only 6 hours of sleep in the last 60 hours. I have issues falling asleep (no diagnosis but I reckon I could get it if I discussed it with doctor and psychologist). He has friends from his home country that he enjoys to play online games with, and voice chats with them while he plays. I have no issue with this, a matter of fact I often do myself when I have spare time and my own room (similar train of thought to playing music/videos through speakers with other people around). He does this in our dorm room, which I personally don't enjoy but can tolerate to a degree. There are two major caveats though to this; the first of those being he will play late into the night consistently. The other is that he mostly plays FPS games, and not to stereotype but he often verbally expresses his frustration and sometimes very loudly. Storytime (Whoever comments ""Storytime"" first I will guild as a reward for reading this far. Seriously, thank you for reading): This week I had 2 midterms. The first of them was yesterday, and the second was today. The night prior to the first, he wasn't voice chatting but was playing an FPS game. At about 11:30p I turn off the lights as per usual on weeknights, and prior to this, I let him know about my midterms and that I would need to get sleep. He plays with his back to my bed, so the screen is facing me and practically blinds me, so I have to sleep on my left side which is difficult as I am used to the right (idk why, I just am). Not a big deal in itself, but the monitor lights up the wall to my left so there is practically nothing dark in the room unless I cover myself in the blanket, which makes it harder to breathe but at least it's dark. Furthermore, he plays with KBM (Keyboard and Mouse) and while his keyboard is supposedly ""silent"", it's not even close and I can hear it clear as day even when I cover my ears with multiple pillows under the aforementioned blanket. I even had tried putting on my headphones with noise-canceling with nothing playing, and turning my fan on max for white noise and I can still hear not only that, but the rapid clicking of the mouse as well. The cherry on top being when he gets frustrated, he often will speak about as loud as if I was trying to talk to someone across a crowded lunch table. Perhaps not for you dear reader, but for me, it is impossible to sleep when someone shouts various things like ""gay little f** stop camping with the (insert weapon here)!"" or ""That's right you little s***head."" After asking him to quiet down a little at around 1am (I had been lying in bed on my left side, my blanket and 2 pillows over my ears for an hour and a half at this point) I was miraculously able to fall asleep at around 1:30am or so and get about 5 hours of sleep, along with 15mg of Melatonin. Yesterday, after my first midterm, I reminded him that I have my next midterm the following day and again will be going to bed at 11:30p. This time though, in addition to everything he did the previous night, he started voice-chatting his friend and playing games at 9p or so and continued it into the night. At around 12:30a I asked him to quiet down and he said ""Ok"" (He was almost shouting it was so loud). Yet he continues to voice chat, and I cannot fall asleep. I finally muster the courage at around **2:30a** and tell him ""Hey _____, it's literally 2:30a and I have a midterm in just over 5 hours. I am unable to get any sleep right now due to how loud that game is, can you please stop talking?"" I knew the clicking and typing would be somewhat loud, but better than the noise from speaking at least. He said ""Ok"" and **continued to play the game for another 45 minutes**. At the end of his call (I still can't sleep), he told his friend he was going to ""turn off the game because I am inconveniencing my roommate"" which I thought was passive aggressive but I was so tired idek. Either way, it was around 3:30a by the time the laptop and call were shutdown, and the room went dark. I slowly, without him noticing, stick my head outside of the oven that is under my blanket to enjoy the dark room when all of a sudden it lights up again! He literally pulled out his phone and started to listen to videos ***through the fucking speakers***. I lose it, because I know there's not a chance I'll fall asleep. I get up without saying a word, put on normal clothes, grab my alarm clock and blanket along with backpack with school supplies, and walk to the class where my midterm is going to be in about 4 hours from that time. I arrive in about 15 mins, and probably fall asleep around 5:30a on the hard-tile floor right next to the door to the classroom. I've read other stories online, and to me this seems to cross a line. I understand that I'm not the only one living in the room and that I need to be empathetic to his wishes as well, but I absolutely need my sleep before a midterm and I feel as if it's non-negotiable. His lack of support or understanding to me seems entirely apathetic, perhaps even failing to understand why sleep is so important to me before a test (again, he has admitted he doesn't care much at all for academia). I have considered that since he and I were both raised in very different areas that perhaps the customs we were ingrained with are contrasted heavily, and I really want to see the good side of him and ensure that my mind isn't just making him a scapegoat here for my personal issues, hence this thread. If you read this far, thank you so very much and I hope this was somewhat entertaining. All I ask for is advice or just your opinion on the matter. Am I absolutely crazy? Again, only a few hours of sleep in the last 60 hours and I don't function well on low sleep, so if I'm bats*** crazy right now just give it to me straight. **TL;DR- Roommate partakes in activities late into the night that prevent me from sleeping, and last night continued to do so after I asked him to be quiet multiple times. As a result I walked across campus around 5a to sleep outside the class I had a midterm at 8a. Am I crazy for thinking his behavior is unacceptable?** Edit: 2 of you said the magic word at the same time, and since I'm too tired to find out who did first you both get gold. Thank you for reading! Edit 2: 25 minute nap and rip inbox. Thank you very much for all the comments, it means a lot and I read each of them. I have decided to purchase some triple-flange silicone earplugs and a sleep mask, and will have a talk with roommate when he gets back tonight and tell him that after 11:30p on school-nights or unless agreed upon, lights are out in the room and any games will be played outside. If he doesn't agree, or fails to adhere, I'll go to the RA and post an update asking for more advice. Once again, thank you for all the replies it means the world to me. Edit 3: About to talk to him as I fell asleep at 7p yesterday when he was out. I’ll make a new post tomorrow I reckon with the results.

"PI will not give me any direction and does questionable science. Currently in my 4th year of my PhD and I feel like my project hasn't really gone anywhere. The biggest difficulty I face right now is that whenever I ask my PI for suggestions, he doesn't give me any good advice. Most of it is wishy washy or vague statements. Actually there are some times where my PI straight up says ""I don't know what to do here"" and I'm left to have to think of things on my own. I thought I'm supposed to get help from my PI. Not only this, but my PI refuses to be convinced by any experimental evidence that goes against his original hypothesis, which in my opinion is extremely bad science. So I feel like I'm stuck in this situation where either I publish questionable results or I don't publish at all. Unfortunately the lab is getting smaller and smaller as people either graduate or straight up leave (because they're unsatisfied) so I don't have many labmates to ask for help. To the labmates that are still here, they have the same complaints that I have and are trying to get out as fast as possible. I am considering asking my committee members for help and if I don't have any prospects for my research I am thinking of simply quitting grad school.

"How much help to expect from Disability Services.

"How to effectively shut down argumentative grade grubbers. Today I had an unpleasantly aggressive grade grubbing experience and I’m looking for advice on ways to effectively shut it down in the future. Two students showed up to office hours today under the guise of wanting to know where they went wrong on the last assignment. The part they were asking about was graded by a TA, but I took a quick look and the TA was correct in how they graded. I explained the errors. I thought that would be the end of it as that’s what they said they came for. Then one begins to argue that there was no way they could ever have known the answer. He explained their thought process, which was wrong. I explained why it was wrong, that the question was challenging and that they’ve learned a lesson for next time. He kept arguing, saying it shouldn’t have been marked wrong that the examples in the text weren’t exactly on point. I said students were required to analogize based on other knowledge. It just kept going in circles, them complaining about losing 6% of a 10% assignment and how unfair it was. After several rounds, I pointed back in my lecture where I explained how to approach these problems. They still complained. Finally, I said enough, do you have any more questions, because we are done here, this is not a negotiation. I also told them this is not the right way to approach a professor. The question was entirely fair. Many students got it right. Many others got it wrong.

I made a post a while ago about my struggle through covid and being behind. I didn't end up passing my candidacy exam in August, but they offered for me to retake it which I quickly accepted. The offer to retake is not available to everyone, I had specific circumstances for being allowed to retake, in addition to having a good presentation that just lacked some depth in terms of thinking (not being far in my project made it hard to think about problem solving things I hadn't gotten to yet), but they were excited for me to retake. &amp;#x200B; Fast forward a few weeks I get married, finish moving my new wife in, and I thought I would just hit the ground running and go. I just find not much happiness or reward in my work, and my passion lacks much compared to people in my lab. I find myself behind again, luckily I haven't dug any hole for myself as I am catching this early on. I am now deciding if I should pull myself up by my bootstraps and just hunker down and get some results. But a big part of me is saying lack of financial motivation, extreme expectations, high anxiety, and lack of interest are worth it. I think half of the lack of interest is from depression, but the other half is me also wanting to just start my life and family. I feel like I am puting my whole life on hold for a little reward which in the end may not matter, because my lack of interest may impede results which then makes me a less competitive candidate when I graduate with a PhD. Its not that I hate chemistry, I still find it really cool and I love aspects of it. I just think I am ready to start working, and this lifestyle feels like a major pause. NOW onto where I need advice. I haven't told my PI this is how i have felt, ever really. I have briefly mentioned feeling over frustrated and having issues finding motivation. He knows about my mental health issues and has been supportive through them. But now I am at the point where I am behind enough I feel like if I mention thats how I feel, thats the path he would encourage/force me to take.

"I built a Chrome extension that answers questions when you double-click them. This started as a side project for someone in my family. My nephew was struggling with online assignments and kept bouncing between tabs, Google, and ChatGPT just to understand questions.

"Do you think that teaching in universities is becoming more difficult and less rewarding for professors. I am in the process of deciding whether to stay in academia after my postdoc or take a position in industry. Obviously, teaching occupies a significant portion of a professor's time, so ideally one should enjoy it. However, there are certain aspects, particularly related to the attitude of students that in my opinion make teaching extremely difficult. There was a recent event which I think highlights some of the issues I have noticed during the time I was a TA in my PhD. Here on Reddit I encountered a post giving voice to some inappropriate comments about a former professor, which were made on another platform where students rate their instructors. Basically, several unhappy students anonymously smeared their professor due to academic performance disputes, calling him a ""psychopath"", ""weirdo"", and calling for him to be fired due to incompetency. First, I found it strange that there is an equivalent of Yelp for university courses. I don't want to dismiss bad experiences that students might have in the classroom. However, I think that every university has clear protocols on handling these situations, and going online to smear a professor publicly is a irresponsible way to approach this situation. While this is a rather extreme example, it raised doubts that I have always had in my experience as a TA during my PhD, which are related to the general attitude of students coming into the class. I used the Yelp analogy because most students seem to view the classroom as a place where they go to get another ""service"" for which they have paid certain amounts of money. In doing so, they seem to be entitled to not only get the ideal service, but also the ideal outcome. If either of those things happens at an unsatisfactory level, one is entitled to complain and be rather disrespectful in doing so. Instead of saying that a pasta dish tasted bad and giving the restaurant 1 star on Yelp, they go on these public smearing campaigns on multiple platforms that facilitate this kind of behavior. This seems wildly inappropriate and unfair towards the professors. But more importantly, I think this kind of attitude is not conducive to a healthy student-professor relationship, which makes certain professors put less emphasis teaching. In my opinion, learning happens primarily as a result of the student challenging themselves, and the professor is someone who can assist them in that process. To me, this is the most crucial aspect of learning, and I don't see how one can do without it. Based on interactions with several professors in my field (STEM), I think that most of them view teaching as a chore and don't get much satisfaction out of it. While this can be viewed as cynical by people outside academia, I definitely understand how maintaining a positive attitude about teaching can be difficult. I have often heard people talk about teaching being a burden primarily due to other responsibilities to the university and research, but I think that an added factor is the changing perception of the general public towards universities and learning in particular. My experience mainly applies to STEM and I have only been a TA during my PhD, but other fields might be similar.

"Student apathy/depression/behavior. I attend a local community college. This semester, I’m taking college algebra course, and Advanced Research Writing. After having some issues in algebra, I’m finally feeling pretty confident. With hard work and consistent studying, I’m currently at a very high B in algebra. As someone who feared math all throughout K-12 and into adulthood, I’m very proud of that. But, I’ve admittedly been half-assing my Research Writing Course. Yet, I’m still holding a very solid A. In fact, based on what the prof has frustratedly vented to the class over the past 3 weeks, I’m one of three out of the 30 students in that class who is holding an A. Over half of the class is apparently failing, and most of those who are passing are barely passing. It’s gotten to the point where the prof’s been having to assign a lot more hand-holdy things (if that makes sense), such as packets with super specific questions instead of more open-ended essays. I’m glad that we have no graded group projects (that I’m aware of) to do in this class. But we still have to do peer-review and group discussions. Frankly, I’m tired of being the only student in a group who has anything to say. Hell, most days, I’m the only student in my class who is brave enough to participate in class discussions. Everyone else just sits silently, wide-eyed as though they have no idea what’s going on. Either that, or they just sit staring at their phones. If I, as a student with diagnosed severe social anxiety, am frustrated by my peers, I can only imagine what my profs feel. Same shit’s going on in my algebra class. I’m one of two students who participates in in-class problem solving. Very rarely does anyone else pipe up to give an answer. I know peer apathy/depression/whatever isn’t my battle to fight. I have too many personal problems to worry about as-is. But, it’s still something that keeps me up at night, especially when I have to work (or, more accurately, try to work) with people who can’t be bothered to pay attention for longer than 2 seconds, or write a single paragraph for peer-review days… Oh, and don’t get me started on the folks who like to talk about anything but class stuff during lectures. The classrooms at my college are small. My parents aren’t spending thousands of bucks for me to listen to conversations about anime and dating drama… I don’t know what the hell is going on.

"Professor Continues to Undermine My Testing Accommodations — What Can I Do. I’m a college student with approved testing accommodations: private room testing and extended time. I had a severe traumatic brain injury in high school, and my accommodations are absolutely necessary for me to have a fair chance — I’m not abusing the system. One of my professors has been making the process extremely difficult. Before the first exam, I was told I’d have a private room, but when I arrived, other students were there. Before the second exam, I reminded him again that my accommodation requires a private room. Instead of fixing it, he made me call him, where he said “private is subjective” and that fewer students was “private enough.” He was rude and dismissive — the call left me in tears. I had to go to the DRC to get it corrected. On our second exam, critical information was missing from a problem (a diameter needed to solve it). Students in the main room were given the missing information and given an extra 15 minutes. I, testing separately as part of my accommodation, wasn’t told anything. I wrote “missing diameter” on my exam and did my best to work around it, but naturally lost points. When I asked about it after, the professor basically said this is “exactly why” I shouldn’t have a private room — implying it’s my fault for using my accommodations. I’m forwarding everything to my school’s disability office and may escalate it to the Dean of Engineering. This has been incredibly stressful and exhausting. I shouldn’t have to fight just to use accommodations that exist because of a real medical condition. It’s taking a real emotional toll on me, on top of the academic pressure.

"Help me choose. Hi guys, I’m currently and international student who is debating mainly between 3 unis to attend and I wanted your opinion on which to choose. I’m going for mechanical engineering undergrad with the hopes of later pursuing a specialization in aerospace (might be challenging seeing as I am an international student with a different citizenship) The 3 unis are and the estimated cost of attendance are - Rochester Institute of Technology: 53k USD (26k per year scholarship) - Steven’s Institute of Technology: 58k USD (30k per year scholarship) - University of British Columbia, Vancouver (in Canada): 59k USD, no scholarship The cost is basically the same although I haven’t negotiated for more in the US unis so idk if I can get more aid. Note that all these are for merit based scholarships, not need. I’m looking for location, employability rate, good community and alumni network, also unis with good name value in the industry is also important for me.

"Can't decide between Michigan State University, Wayne State and UMich Dearborn. This is gonna be kinda long. It’s decision day but I can't decide. I'm enrolled in all three colleges bc I got fee waivers so they were free. I'm majoring in CS. My main goal was to go to UMich Ann Arbor COE but I got wait-listed. Fingers crossed but obviously can't bet on that. Full ride at Wayne, UMich Ann arbor and Umich Dearborn. Estimated cost for MSU is $13713 (didn't count travel expenses bc I'm living on campus imma just walk or take the bus everywhere any way). I'm not taking student loans no matter what. Recently there was an awards night where I got all the scholarships. So -$6500 first year and -$2000 for the second. Bringing my first year estimated cost for MSU down to around $7213. I applied to a bunch of other scholarships (local and national) as well and I won't get results till mid summer. If I attend Wayne or UMD my scholarships are forfeit because I'm getting everything paid anyway which I don't like. My main, overarching goal is to transfer over to UMich Ann Arbor. CS at MSU is obviously leagues better than UM dearborn and Wayne but is it $7213 better? Or even $18926 (as of now) better if I get rejected from UMich again for fall 2026 and attend MSU the first two years? Dearborn’s program is kind of subpar(no offense) but I know it's very easy to transfer credits over from there to AA. Plus apparently 50% of UMD transfer applicants get into UMich compared to only 45% of transfer applicants from other schools according to this website : https://publicaffairs.vpcomm.umich.edu/ Plus it's a full ride and I got into the honors college. But should I really go to a school that's leagues below solely for the hopes that I might get accepted to UMich later on? Or am I wrong and is UMD comparable to MSU? I'm 100% for sure not graduating from UMD. Because if I don't get into UMich Ann arbor after applying during my sophomore year at the latest at UMD, I'll just transfer to Wayne or MSU, where I'll get accepted easily any year unless I do something really stupid. MSU is the best out of the three but I don't know if it's worth the cost. Will I get scholarships to help out sophomore year? I know there's better networking, better extracurricular options, job opportunities, etc. especially for CS but by what margin? Although I also plan on applying to a bunch of ivy leagues sophomore year of college (the net price calculator, which is accurate, predicts I'm getting a lot of aid IF I do get accepted, e.g. estimated costs only $5k @ Columbia OOS, but that's obviously a big IF). MSU is better known around the country so for applying to ivies in the future it might be a better option. Also I feel like I'll be a far better educated student going to MSU then UMich then I would be going from Wayne/UMD to UMich in my college journey. Or even MSU to some Ivy. 85% chance even if I attend MSU unless I keep getting aid I'm not graduating from there bc 4 years is too expensive. Wayne is just kind of in between. How is Wayne CS program compared to UMD? Especially when it comes to AI and self-driving cars because that's what I'm interested in. As a school in general I know it's more prestigious than UMD so it might be better for ivies, but which is better to get me into UMich? And which is better to help make me a well educated individual? Better opportunities? I'm applying to UMich AA every single year idc as a freshman sophomore junior. I did get wait-listed and not straight up rejected so that looks better. Admission officers will obviously tell you they don't care about that but I don't think it's true. When I apply to transfer UMich first year they'll put more emphasis on my High school record and I guess it was good enough to at least not get me rejected, which I'll emphasize next time I apply. No, I'm not going to a community college. I care just a little bit about the traditional college experience, but definitely not enough to go broke over. I care mostly about being a successful person and I understand a college doesn't make or break you but better schools definitely increase your chances in being successful in life. So yeah. Help. I need advice. Is full ride honors college at Wayne/UMD better than MSU for my situation? Where should I go, what should I do? Should I wait and see if I win more scholarships and get a full ride at MSU first year? If I get full ride or close to full ride first from the scholarships I've yet to win, should I go to msu first year? Is it worth more than the possible advantages and privileges of being a UMD honors transfer applicant to U Mich Ann arbor? My current hopes and plans (subject to change depending on you guys) are : •Get off wait-list and attend UMich Ann arbor this fall (highly unlikely to get off wait-list) •Go to MSU first year and burn all the scholarship money then get accepted to UMich for my sophomore year. •If rejected by UMich again, stay at MSU for sophomore year then apply to UMich again as well as a couple ivy leagues. (Huge problem bc I barely have any aid for MSU sophomore year but my parents income might go up slightly) •If accepted to UMich or Ivy leagues I'm chilling bc of full rides and/or lots of aid. •If rejected even after that, I might need to transfer from MSU to Wayne @ Junior year bc I can't afford MSU more than two years. Actually my parents might but I don't wanna spend that much money. But it would mean I wasted 2 years at MSU just to get a degree in Wayne anyway. I'm not worried about time constraints because I have fee waivers for literally everything.

"I have a Biology Professor who is completely unreasonable, was it wrong of me to email a complaint to the head of the department. So I just had a my first exam in this class. I went over every ounce of content the Professor provided, and the exam had a bunch of stuff on it that seemed to be outside of what she provided/far more complicated than what she taught, I had high confidence going into this exam and came out extremely bummed and unsatisfied. Today I get an email from the professor that went to the whole class regarding the exam. I received a 63% on this exam (despite studying 40 hours in one weekend, and taking notes prior etc.) The class average was a ~62%. And the high was 99%. The professor stated she was not going to curve it. And stated this was “normal” as he exams usually have an average score of 50-60%. The kicker was that the email contained a downright insulting remark addressing students that read as follows: “If you went into the exam thinking you were prepared but didn’t get the grade you expected, then you weren’t as prepared as you thought. This is likely due to your poor study habits, which you likely haven’t realized yet.” This insulted me and made me angry. The professor blames the students despite her poor teaching methods. And reviews on Rate My Professor that I only now recently read have students saying the same thing. Note that this is only a 200 level class, and the professor seems to be making things difficult intentionally. Vomiting information at the students over voice PowerPoint slides, and not effectively teaching them. As a result of this, I emailed the head of the department, saying that this is unfair treatment, and that she is not even accommodating students in reasonable ways considering the current pandemic.

"Accidentally made Professor look bad in class. I accidentally made a professor look bad in class and he was not happy about it after class. Here’s the story: He made a mistake in class that he corrected and then some time later went on a long tangent about how we should try to get into management within 5 years at a company. While discussing this he talked about meetings and cautioning against saying incorrect things that might make you look bad, which is when I gave an example of a mistake, related to what we are learning, as light humor and said the first thing that came to mind. This happened to be the mistake that he made earlier in class and the connection between the mistake and that fact that he mentioned it slipped my mind. Nonetheless he was not happy about it and asked me to see him in his office where he expressed his anger at me. I apologized immediately, realizing very quickly the mistake I made. He basically called me disrespectful and stupid for the perceived insult, thinking I did it on purpose. And he also said that if it was a company he would fire me for gross insubordination. He thought about taking further action (I assume taking the matter to the department head), but after I explained to him that it wasn’t intentional and it slipped my mind he said he won’t take further action and told me think before I speak (yes, I know that most of you will say the same) and that he expects only exemplary work. Even though he said he accepts my apology, I am worried that he will grade me harshly for the final exam.

Do you currently use flashcards? Which app? 2. How long does it take you to make a deck? 3. Would you trust auto-generated flashcards if you could edit them? 4.

To jump off that question, what should I put on my desc when looking for a roommate through the college? I know i want to bring quite a few books, but concerned about room, are there any suggestions? I have the option between a farther room with a microwave and tub but smaller room by a few feet, vs a room larger with a few feet, no tub, and no microwave but a two hundred feet or so closer to everything.

So, how should I prepare for those subjects and how can I be consistently good at them? 4) Another matter is my work. I heard that international students are not allowed to work. The thing is although I am fine with not working, I still want to extend my social circle, and I think the workplace is the best place to make friends with people outside of Taylor's university.

"Am I a good candidate for a scholarship in Europe. Hello! So, I'm 22 years old and currently finishing my Physics undergrad in a Brazilian university. Since I'm interested in a career in research, I really want to do my Masters abroad, where I can expect more funding and just better chances of growth overall. For a while now, I've been preparing myself to apply for a scholarship for a German university, through one of the StipendiumPlus institutes. I'm doing my best to be a strong candidate, but since I don't know anyone with experience for these kinds of applications for European unis, I don't know how well I can expect to do in the selection process. So I turned to this sub just to get some opinions. If anyone here has knowledge about this, can you share some insight? This is my general profile: 1. Academic merits: As of right now, I'm in the 8th semester, with an average of 9.55/10. I was also placed 1st in the entrance exam (similar to the American SAT) among Physics applicants. 2. Activity: I'm an active member of the Relativity lab at my university, with one publication as co-author in a A1 journal. I can expect to submit one more article before my graduation. I have also presented posters in scientific events a total of 4 times, for which I have certificates. 3. Social engagement: Since May, I volunteer at an organization that cares for children with cancer and other diseases. I love the kids and plan to stay there as long as possible. I'm socially progressive (which is a criteria for some institutions) and donate to causes that matter to me. 4. Other activities: I teach sporadically (since I can't formally work yet, local legalisms) as a tutor, 6th grade up. I'm also a dancer, but I don't know if that would weigh in in any way. 5. Language: I'm C2 in English and I've been studying German since 2021. I will take the Goethe C1 test in March, hopefully I will pass. 6. Misc: I have some ability with Python and C++, though I'm admittedly rusty as of today. I have a few options of people I can reach out to in order to get recommendation letters. Like I said, I don't have a reference point as to wheter these things make me stand out, or if they are just bread and butter. These institutions get applicants from everywhere in the world, probably very talented and accomplished themselves. I expect to graduate in July and, if everything goes right, start my Masters in April 2026. Is there anything else I should do to be better prepared before then? How hopeful can I be?

"FAFSA is for everyone, not just the poor. If your family's EFC is too high, you will not be eligible for Pell Grants and subsidized loans. However, you can always take out unsubsidized loans. You do not need your parent's help (besides the income information they provide for your FAFSA) to take out the loans. The financial aid department at your college will do that. That being said, unsubsidized loans alone will not be sufficient for your tuition + room &amp; board. The maximum for a dependent freshman is something around $5,500/year. This number rises a bit if you're an independent student (or considered one), but would still be insufficient for your goals. Scholarships are an often, but the most common scholarships are small dollar-figure scholarships. I suppose you could cobble together enough $500 essay scholarships to pull it off, but that would be worth an essay in an of itself. Most of the time when people talk about scholarships they're either referring to need-based scholarships that reduce costs to around the same as an in-state university or merit-based scholarships that eliminate the costs entirely. To receive a merit-based scholarships, you'd generally either need some exceptional talent (most notably athletic) or you'd need to be considerably more academically qualified for the schools than your peers. Normally state universities hand out few, if any, academic merit scholarships that aren't explicit state programs. Your state may well have some programs available that reduce/eliminate the cost of tuition. However, these are normally means-tested as well, so your parent's income can screw you there as well. The most common solutions to your problem: 1. Join the military. This will delay college a few years, but will completely solve the 'pay for it' end of things. There are also other programs such as ROTC or the service academies that eliminate the upfront costs at the expense of a backend service commitment. 2. Attend Community College. You can easily attend Community College with solely unsubsidized loans. If your parents let you remain at home, that eliminates the room/board issue. You'd also be able to demonstrate a level of academic performance that might soften their stance on helping you out financially once you get to the point where you need to attend a 4-year school",Fees,Medium,1.0,web:pullpush:r/college:comment:scholarship delay,Medium,1,2331,378,7,"FAFSA is for everyone, not just the poor.",0

Decisions were originally supposed to be released mid-to-late March, so this was extremely unexpected and last-minute. I’d love to go, but: The aid isn’t nearly enough The deposit deadline passed before I even knew I was admitted I’m not even sure they gave me a full need-based aid review Has anyone experienced something similar?

"Looking for students interested in neuroscience / psych to collaborate on a project. Hey everyone, I’m a student who’s really interested in neuroscience and mental health, and I recently started a small student-led project called NeuroWave. The idea is pretty simple: create a space where students interested in neuroscience / psychology / medicine can work together on things like: writing articles or research summaries discussing real research papers doing small student-led research or review projects and some mental health outreach stuff (like writing supportive messages) It’s not a company or anything — just a group of motivated students who want to learn, build, and maybe publish some work together instead of studying alone. If you’re someone who: wants research experience likes writing about science or just wants to collaborate with other students on something meaningful I’d love to connect.

"Never make your students use Cengage (specifically, WebAssign). Cengage's app loading time on android and web is far too long for common tasks such as flipping through textbook pages to find relevant content. Your students will be searching for pirated versions of the textbook immediately, despite having to pay for this one. Those same pirate sites also have the instructor's answer key. Furthermore, the web app logs students out after a surprisingly short time, causing inconvenience and frustration. I just finished working out a problem on paper, and when I came back, I was logged out and had to spend a minute clicking through their dialogs and menus again. That's fine the first 300 times I have to do it, then it gets irritating. The pricing is high for the features it offers. Khan Academy, for example, offers video lectures and *adaptive* problem sets up higher-level calculus and linear algebra completely for free. Brilliant, a paid, consumer-facing service, offers an incredibly well-designed comparison to cengage, being far better at leveraging the unique web technologies for a far cheaper price. I'm unfamiliar with university-specific software, but I cannot conceive of a worse app than cengage. Please look elsewhere, for the sake of future students. Finally, the ui is confusing and messy. Most buttons in the side panels and menus offer no benefit to the average student and only serve to get in the way.

"I can’t tell if my PI is genuinely toxic or I just need to work harder. To start off, I’m actually an undergrad in undergraduate research but I thought this might still be applicable to the subreddit because some of the grad students have the same complaint; To give some background, I work in a wet lab studying biological processes. My PI is the type of PI that works closely with undergrads (which I know is unusual) and is basically always present whenever I’m in the lab. Perhaps some of you with Asian parents from the older generation can relate; but my PI (in our view) is always micromanaging and giving harsh criticisms to me and everyone else in the lab. There was one time that one of my peers was close to crying because he really got chewed out for filling a bottle on the bench as opposed to over the sink (risk of spilling wastes money); He has very low tolerance for mistakes made, and then if you try to explain what happened/ why the mistake occurred he interprets it as arguing and gets more pissed “why do you always have to talk back?” And then he turns to another student and says “ see this is what I have to deal with every day haha; he always rebuttals and then I have to spend more time with this guy to shut him down don’t you agree?” I have ADHD so sometimes when him or someone else is explaining some complex unit conversions verbally, I space out and I have to ask them to reiterate or try to draw it out on the whiteboard; but he’s really chewed me out every time for this “why are you making me repeat myself. You tire everyone out when you make people repeat things already mentioned” so now I just say I “got it” even if I don’t. He defends his position by saying that his protein samples are very expensive and he can’t afford to have us undergrads ruining his experiments. He sort of downplays the whole situation saying “ you know how I am; I like to nag my students to make sure they do their best” On a side note, I can’t tell if it’s just his personality or our lab is just severely underfunded, but we are required to reuse dirty latex gloves and Saran Wrap to “save money” as well. It’s gotten to a point where sometimes I have these nightmares where I’m getting yelled at and I just awaken in cold sweat; But apparently he says good things about me behind my back when I’m not there so I really feel bad if I was to leave his lab… what should I do?

"Feeling frustrated with online classes. I'm in my early 40s, returning to university online to get a degree. I last went to university in 2005, in person, of course. I started back again this past spring, and have also taken summer and now fall classes. I chose to do this online because we have only one vehicle in a very un-walkable place, and my husband needs it for work. I'm glad to have the opportunity to study online, but it's also been very frustrating and time-consuming. My experience so far is that professors generally post the textbook, the publisher-provided powerpoint, assignments and tests online, and that is the extent of their involvement with the class. I thought the point of having teachers is for someone who knows the subject to be able to break it down and explain it to people who don't. Almost everything is auto-graded by Canvas or the textbook software (and I'm not going into the problems I've had with that). If the professor bothers to record a ""lecture"" they just read the powerpoint that the textbook publisher made with no further explanations or examples or tips to remember things or anything that would help someone actually learn any of it. This makes everything way harder than it needs to be, and also takes a lot more time. I spend at least 80 hours a week reading, taking notes and doing problems from the textbooks and seeking out additional resources to fully understand the material. Even taking into account that I am older, much more tired and don't retain information as well as I used to, it just seems like excessive work. Twenty years ago, I went to 2-3 classes every day for lectures, taking notes. Textbooks often didn't need to be read, but I would crack them open in case anything was missed during lectures. When I turned assignments in and had questions, problems would usually be discussed before the lecture started. I felt like I was actually *being taught.* Now I feel like I'm teaching myself, with some person assigned to ""grade"" my work. I doubt I could attend in person, but I'm not sure it's any better in person now because I've seen and heard people talk about in person classes being much the same.

"The most important part is research. One of the huge difficulties you will face (as I assume based on your statements that you are in the US) is that grant opportunities are hugely diminished. This means competition will be fierce, so you should figure out where you will aim, the due dates and start writing now. The second aspect will be publications, which I don't think will be harder in the near term, unless you work in a field where there is a political opinion (anything related to gender or sexuality for example). Regardless, it would be good to work on some papers - ideally not independent from what you plan to submit for grants. It's better to have a smaller number of deep ideas than to scatter shot, at least until you've received a grant. I would not submit any papers for publication until you start, however, unless you are worried about being scooped. I don't know what field you are in, but I have found that it is nearly impossible to use classes as a way to help with research. Even dedicated undergraduate researchers rarely break even in terms of time. It's probably better to aim to teach more conventionally until you have experience and understand the variation in abilities of the students you will deal with at your institution. Take a week off right before you start and let your brain relax, but work hard most of the summer. Despite the issues with the political landscape, you have the advantage that you have almost no professional responsibilities to get in the way of your research, and you already have the position lined up.

I have been experiencing some real awkwardness with this ""two faced person"". I am a sports captain of my college and due to that I have a lot of friends and juniors who respect me a lot so when my roommate came in college, he was a really depressed person, not wanting to live, bad mother, etc. So I included him in my sports team even although he knew nothing. I coached him from basics and took him in many tournaments with me. Let's call him **X**. X is very different when he is alone with me- sweet, kind, almost agrees with everything I say, etc. In a friend group, he acts differently, always trying to prove me wrong, making a fuss even if I joke about something, jealous if I am the centre of attention, he acts really insecure. So a girl really likes me(I like her too but for now I want to spend time with her to know her better and then decide to move forward) and he knows that too because she confessed it to him. She is in my sports team too so we hang out after training or during eating hours. Recently he has been very touchy with her, it is really bothering me. When we are outside, he is very talkative with others, laughing, making jokes, etc. but as soon as we step inside boys hostel, he does not talk to me. It ALWAYS has to be me to start conversation, if I didn't then we might not talk for days. Has he only used me? Was I the stepping stone for him? GOSH it sucks! Am I overthinking?

"Where do i go. I've been thinking pretty hard about this and I still have no clue what to do. There's about 5 days left until I need to make a decision but currently my options are between UMICH (OOS) and IUB (In-State) for CS. The problem is that I quite literally got $0 worth of aid from my IN STATE school even though my SAI is -1500. I got a decent amount of aid from UMICH but it'll cost around 24k out of pocket after federal loans (total cost of attendance). IUB is around 18k out of pocket after federal loans per year but it'll go down to around 13k after year one. But like, where is this money coming from? I luckily ended up founding a small business the previous year that will pay for the first year of school for both, but after that what do I do? This money isn't going to appear out of thin air, and I'll end up having to either take parent-plus loans, which wont even be possible with my parent's most likely getting denied (I wouldn't put them in debt either), or taking on private loans which from what I have seen, is pretty bad. For reference I am a transfer student that took a gap year who also happened to change their majors which is probably why I'm getting screwed by my in state financial aid. Either that or they just don't like me :C But it's just been a really hard decision and it seems like either one that I go to I will need to magically be able to work 40 hours a week alongside doing schoolwork just to barely afford attending. UMICH Total Cost = \~80,500 IUB Total Cost = \~59,000 \^ Remember this is out of pocket AFTER loans I do have more of a safety college (IUPUI) that would be around \~32,000, but I'm not too sure if I would be able to secure a job after graduating with how competitive CS is now from a lesser known school. But that might apply to even UMICH, so I'm not entirely sure how everything goes with hiring. Sorry for the big rant this decision is very not fun, any advice would help honestly. I'm essentially a first generation student and its been tough without much guidance. I really wish I could have gone to UMICH but it does seem out of reach, am I just forced into the cheapest option?

"Ungraded assigments right before midterm. I need some advice regarding one of my professors. So I emailed him early last week asking about our midterm and how to best prepare, he mentioned studying the homework assignments for chapters 1-3. I thought, okay fair. At the time, we had submitted and received grades for Chapters 1 &amp; 2 and I had just submitted Chapter 3 thinking, it would be graded by the weekend. I also asked him if the new material from Chapter 3 would be covered even though it wasn't part of the homework and he said it would be. I was annoyed that we hadn't had the chance to practice the new material but I was already feeling defeated. Well, the weekend came and our homework was not graded, instead, he assigned additional homework covering the rest of Chapter 3 but set a due date for after the midterm. I've completed the most recent homework but the material isn't easy and there are people still working on the homework even though the midterm is tomorrow. I also have zero clue if I did it right or wrong and will have no way of knowing until after the midterm. Even if he grades it by the morning it's too late. Now, I realize I should've said something early this week expressing my concerns, but honestly, I was nervous to say anything. I have studied the material to the best of my abilities but I can't shake that I should say something anyway because I do believe that if universities are going to charge us an arm and a leg to get an education, the least they could do is have assignments graded before midterms so we can have feedback and study any material we have gaps in. I'm also shocked that this midterm is almost half our grade and we are being tested on stuff we don't even have feedback on. Now this is where I'd like some feedback. Does this email sound okay? Should I send this before my midterm or should I wait to send a complaint after the midterm? Also, should I even complain to the professor, or should I go straight to the dean? My plan was to send this to my professor first and then escalate if needed. However, I am not sure what's appropriate here. &amp;#x200B; *Dear Professor \[\],* *I am reaching out to express my concerns about the current state of the class, particularly in light of tomorrow's midterm.* *As we approach the midterm, covering material from Chapters 1, 2, and 3, I have prepared for the exam to the best of my abilities. However, I am facing a challenging situation due to the ungraded homework assignments in Chapter 3.* *One of the assignments for Chapter 3, which was due last week, remains ungraded. Additionally, Homework 4, covering the remaining material in Chapter 3, is due after the midterm. I firmly believe that receiving timely feedback on our assignments is essential to help us understand the material that we are tested on. Without this feedback, it becomes challenging for us, the students, to identify and address any gaps in our knowledge before the exam.* *While I understand that grading is a time-consuming process, I would like to express the added stress and uncertainty caused by ungraded assignments, particularly in the proximity of a midterm that accounts for almost half of our grade.* *While it may not be feasible to rectify the current situation, I would like to propose, if possible, assigning and providing feedback on assignments at least a week before exams in the future. This adjustment would significantly contribute to our preparation and enhance our confidence in approaching exams for this class.* *Thank you for taking the time to address these concerns.

"Prof pushing due date up by 10 days with 3 days notice. Pretty much just as the title says. I live in a southern area that was hit very hard by Helene. The Carolina’s had it way worse but I’m finally able to say our town was horrible without feeling guilt. We lost 99% of power with some out as long as 15 days. I was fortunate to go through only 10. With what I’ve described, it’s clear ISPs would be out for a bit after power came back. On top of that, my schools internal system shut down and that took longer to bring up than how long it took to get power/ internet for about 2 weeks. So if you were an online student, you couldn’t access courses. Even on campus when they had power and internet. Professors were in the same boat as students with loss of power so it took a bit before they updated due dates via announcements, texts, emails. Here is the issue. One of my professors moved the due date to 12/4 during late October. (Storm hit 9/26 so it took time to get to that point) Today, she sent out an email stating the due date was 11/24. So like 3 days notice. I understand how hectic it has been since so I have the benefit of the doubt she misspoke and sent an email basically saying “hey I’ve had tim his timeline since October. The shortened doesn’t work, I’ll work on finishing earlier though and I appreciate you accepting it” (I did not say it that rude, just paraphrasing and not wanting to be too specific) They respond and totality avoid even acknowledging the due date, criticize me for not getting more done, and refuse to take anything past this new deadline. They moved a due date up 10 days with 3 day notice. I have documentation of all of this, including emails to my person email when the system was down acknowledge he date. I’m reaching out to the head of dept first. This person is also a current professor of mine and I have 3 out of 4 classes with then again next term. I did respond to “bad” professor and pointed out what I had done and that I had a perfectly fine timeline based on what she said in October and I explained I was extremely confused on how a due date could jump almost 2 weeks with just a few days notice and I asked her to please explain it. She hasn’t responded (her initial response took hours and it was like a min before “business hours” lol. But I do not think I need to respond to her anymore anyway.

"Help an FGLI choose their college major. Hi, I’m a first-generation, low-income senior entering college next fall. I’m deciding between majoring in chemical/biomedical engineering or a science major (biochemistry/chemistry) for premed. I don’t have preference between engineering or medicine. I just want to find a stable job with decent pay after college to support myself and help my parents. I’m decent at science subjects throughout high school, and participated in chemistry/medical research with university professors but had limited exposure to engineering. However, based on my grades, I’m not really excelling in math and physics classes (had a 2 on the AP Physics 1 exam and dropped out of AP Physics 2), which made me concern about my ability to pursue an engineering major in college and get an engineering job. I used to be very keen on pursuing engineering because I don’t think I can afford going to med school without putting a financial burden on my family. Recently though, I was given a full ride to my state school, so my undergraduate years will be free for me. As a result, I might be able to afford medical school with minimum student loan debt if I save up money and get scholarships. This new opportunity seriously makes me question if I should be a doctor instead. I went to a magnet high school specializing in medical research, all of my friends are premed students, and my parents also want me to pursue medicine. I’m also exposed to the medical field a lot due to my mom’s health conditions. I enjoyed medical research and I think I can succeed with premed courses. My only problems with being a doctor are affording medical school and the wait to be a doctor. The biggest reason I chose engineering in the past was the major’s high return investment. Engineering seems like a stable career and many engineering jobs pay well even if you only have a Bachelor’s degree. While being a doctor can pay well too, it usually takes 8-10 years to start practicing medicine and many doctors have crazy amount of student loan debts, which delays their ability to make money right away. My academic skills indicate that I’ll be better off doing premed, but engineering is so much more affordable for me as a low-income student. My partner, who’s a current MechE told me I can pass engineering in college because I work hard and smart enough to not fail classes but I’ll be miserable since I’m not good at math or physics. All my friends who choose to pursue engineering are superior in math and physics compared to me. I don’t want to major in engineering while doing premed either because I think I’ll be burnt out and failed at both. I know I can wait until sophomore year to declare a major, but as an FGLI who’s desperate to achieve financial independence after college, I really want to know now which major I should do.

Honestly community college is the way to go if you need to save money. I am getting a full semester for how much people probably pay in random added on fees alone. I too am paying for my college so 2 years of cheap tuition and getting my grades up to transfer for the other 2 years to a university/college is gonna save me loads. It is a bummer to miss out on the typical college experience and trust me I am jealous of some of my friends we're only human but once those 4 years are up you aren't gonna want to be in loads of debt. Also it doesn't add an extra two years it's 2 years of community 2 years of college/university. In regard to making friends it is a bit harder but I do chat with some people on campus and there's usually activities going on.

"What to do in asynchronous social science classes due to AI and cheating. I am a assistant prof in the social sciences at an institution that recently gained R1 status. My university recently started an online degree program in my field. The administration is very excited about it because they see it as a revenue stream. Students love the online classes we offer because many work and have busy lives, they are generally easier, and for many it's easier to cheat in those classes. The demand is really high for them. We have a lot of online classes! I teach a few online since it is generally encouraged by the department and the university. I will likely be teaching more in the future since we started the online program. I usually require a mix of discussion forums, online quizzes, and writing assignments. I'm really frustrated because students use AI to do discussion forums and the writing assignments and they Google whatever answers they can on the quizzes. I've kind of given up, but it pains me to have to spend time grading and reading AI essays. One issue with student writing is that it's always been vague, cliche and nonspecific, but now that students use AI, the writing is a little cleaner. I also find a lot of inconsistencies in the writing since AI makes stuff up. Is there any way to run an online asynchronous class and give assignments and get students to actually learn/read something?

"Seeking Advice on My Future as a Petroleum Engineering Student. Hi everyone, I'm a third-year petroleum engineering student and I'm at a crossroads in my education and career journey. I need to make some important decisions and I'm looking for advice from all of you. The dilemma I'm facing is that, upon completing my bachelor's degree, I'm required by state law to fulfill a mandatory military service, which I'd like to avoid if possible. Here are the options I'm considering: 1. **Pursuing a Master's Degree Locally:** Completing a master's program in my home country, which typically lasts for two years, would delay my military service. However, I'd still be obligated to serve in the military after completing the master's degree. I may work at this time 2. **Utilizing a State Scholarship:** My country offers state scholarships that cover all expenses for studying abroad. However, this option comes with a commitment to work in my home country for five years after finishing my education abroad. 3. **Self-Sponsoring Abroad:** I could explore the possibility of using my own resources to settle abroad, study, and potentially build a career there. This option would grant me more freedom in terms of my education and career path but comes with financial challenges and uncertainties. 4. **Postponing Decision and Going to the Army:** Another option is to fulfill my mandatory military service first, losing one year, and then figure out my next steps. While this would offer temporary relief, it doesn't align with my long-term career goals. Ideally, I aspire to work for a company like BP in the field of petroleum engineering, where I believe I have decent prospects.

"need advice/dealing with guilt. so i’m currently a junior in credits (87) but this is my fourth year in school. i’m a computer science major and i’ve had a really hard time finishing this degree i’ve failed quite a Lot of classes, and have dropped a few as well. for about a year i lied and told my parents that school was going fine, which wasn’t the case at all. it has been destroying me mentally knowing that i lied to them. i’ve had trouble sleeping, made myself physically ill everytime i think about how i had been lying to them (which has made me lose weight and i’m already pretty underweight🥲), have been dealing with horrible thoughts and have had a hard time looking them in the eyes. its incredibly unfair to my parents for me to lie to them and i’m well aware of that. earlier this week i woke up, got in my car and called them and told them the truth. they were obviously very upset with me, but they were more upset that i had his this from them from so long. we’ve been talking about if this is something that i really want to keep doing and what/where i should go from here. although i know my actions haven’t showed it, i want this degree more than anything. i know how much it’s going to help me in the future and i know that i can do it, it’s just been really hard but i know i can do this. even though i told them the truth and they’ve said that they aren’t mad at me (at least for the grades, which isn’t a completely true because who wouldn’t be?) i still feel horrible. i know i should feel horrible still because what i did was incredibly wrong, but i feel like an absolute shit human being and horrible daughter. im doing my school work and going to all of my classes (still struggling, but not as badly as past semesters and being honest about where i am) but this is affecting my ability to think and work still. i can’t shake the feeling that my parents think i’m an awful human being (and that i think im an awful humain being) and that i should just give up on life completely, despite them still being supportive especially considering what i’ve done. they have always worked their absolute hardest to support me and i’ve always tried to make them know that i love them and appreciate everything they do for me, but i feel like i’ve just thrown it all in their faces. i just want to stop feeling like this so that i can do what i need to do to start doing well in school again and complete this degree and start moving on with my life. i think that telling them was the first step in turning my terrible grade track record around, i feel slightly less stressed and don’t wake up thinking “holy shit how am i supposed to tell them this” every morning. also to make matters slightly worse im supposed to go home in a few days for spring break, and as much as i want to go home and just see my family again and just spend time with them, i feel so ashamed to show my face and part of me just wants to go full recluse mode in my apartment i don’t want this to be pity post and i know i should probably seek some sort of therapy so i don’t really know why i’m posting this. i guess if anyone has been in a similar situation and would like to share how they dealt with these horrible thoughts that would help :) thanks in advance",Fees,Medium,1.0,web:reddit:r/college:search:unfair grading,Medium,1,3256,632,7,need advice/dealing with guilt.,0

"similar boat here. good luck on cymbalta, I really hope it helps you; for me it was a complete waste of more than a year, had zero of the intended good effects, only the bad side effects. and the withdrawls are the worst illness I've ever experienced in my life so far, and they set in FAST (15 hour half-life on average, so make sure you don't miss a dose). as for the rest of it, I managed to get enrolled in an intensive outpatient therapy group over the summer, where I went for CBT and DBT for 3 hours every day, for 3 months, and it's been incredibly helpful, so if regular talk therapy doesn't do it for you, I'd really consider trying group.

I don't know a single person, even doctors, who has a healthy sleep schedule or proper sleep hygiene. it's ridiculously difficult to have good sleep hygiene in this era, especially in school with so much required online. definitely focus on tackling sleep first out of the self-care list, and stuff like showering, brushing teeth, etc. then diet, then exercise. it's harder than it sounds though, unfortunately. another problem you will run into is having no money, unless you actively have a job or your family is heavily funding you. taking a gap year after already starting university means you will most likely lose any/all scholarships you had been awarded before. I wish to God I'd taken a gap before starting last year, because the pandemic absolutely ruined my entire academic career as well as my physical and mental health. campus counseling is a good place to start, but sometimes they have limitations on how many meetings you can have (at my uni the student health center offers 5 meetings maximum, then you have to transfer to somewhere else). if you have insurance, I'd suggest starting as soon as possible with someplace more long-term. the people in your college's counseling center can help you find one. ultimately, try not to do something you may regret later such as accidentally throwing away all of your scholarships or delaying on starting recovery like I did haha, but do remember that at the end of the day your health and wellbeing will always be more important than social expectations of constant productivity",Placement & Career Services,Medium,1.0,web:pullpush:r/college:comment:scholarship delay,Medium,1,2330,410,17,similar boat here.,0

"Feeling like nothing matters now. I am getting my Ph.D. in English literature, a dream of mine since I was very young. My master's and Ph.D. have been covered (except taxes) by a graduate teaching assistantship grant and stipend, for which I am so grateful. However, Covid, budget issues, and political issues have made my whole Ph.D. experience miserable. With the current house bills floating around Florida, our department feels under attack, and teaching has become very difficult. In addition, many professors are unhappy and this semester I have noticed a decline in communication about everything happening in our department. Jobs in the state pay nothing, but also rumors are swirling that after DeSantis's New College take over, humanities jobs will be increasingly hard to come by (even more so) and the restrictions will be plentiful if the house bills pass. While I have always wanted to move out of Florida, my family is here. My husband has a good job that brings in great money and has been there for 20 years next year. We have a young child. Leaving would not necessarily be the best move financially and support wise. In addition, I have been applying to conferences, grants, and archival research trips, with varying success. I got a few rejection letters and waitlist letters this week, which has me down. My department keeps pushing us to travel and go to conferences, but I no longer see the point if jobs are dried up and my university offers no funding for graduate students to attend. I do not want to go into debt (and honestly can't) for travel for conferences. I am being told, ""CV lines get jobs,"" but what jobs? How are people affording this with inflation? What am I doing wrong? I am feeling for the first time that everything I am doing doesn't matter anymore and that I should just quit. I feel lost and despite support around me, I feel like I am lacking in major ways or missing something that would help me feel more successful.

"parents don't agree with college decisions - help. i recently just got off the waitlist for a state school (let's call this school A) that i've wanted to go to for so long. during high school, my dad moved to said state for work to assure that i'd get in state tuition if i got in. obviously, i got waitlisted and nobody could predict that i would get off of it, so his current plan is to move back to my hometown at the end of the year. there is a possibility that i'd still get in state tuition for a year, but i'm not sure yet. the current school (call this school B) that i am committed to is a T-25 with incredible academics; no complaints there. i've already registered for my classes and have a great schedule, live in a great dorm, and have a great roommate. i'm supposed to move in my dorm in about 2 weeks. but, i have never loved this school. from when i applied and up until now, i have been extremely depressed about the thought of my next 4 years there. i'm very familiar with the school because my brother also graduated from there. i also went to the orientation last month and made 0 friends and just felt extremely unfit to be there. i have thought about transferring after doing a year, but it's just unrealistic because the schools that are academically better are generally only ivies that take less than 100 transfers a year. school A is ranked in the top 50, so yes, much lower than school B. however, i don't care about that at all because i have visited the campus and know a few students. i would say the students there are very much on par with the students at the school i am committed at. the academics and research are great, and there's lots to do here. i feel like the students here have a similar work ethic to mine, and are actually passionate about their interests. i love how it's in the city and the opportunities that i can get from the location. i love the campus and the vibe there is much more me. the main problem is that i'm not guaranteed to get into the major/majors that i want, which is a huge risk (30-70% chance that i'd get in depending on the major) because if i dont get in, i would pretty much have no degree/study something i don't want to have a career in. i am pretty set on what i want to do (stats/econ/data science/ health informatics) but this school is known to be veryyy competitive for those majors. at school B, i would still have to apply for my majors, but it would be much easier, guaranteeing that i'd be graduating on time studying something that i actually want to do. it will be better for my future and career, but i know i would be so unhappy there. additionally, it's in the east coast. my plan is to work in the west coast, which is where school A is. i've seen the employment rates for both schools, and most students generally end up working in whatever coast the school they graduated from is located. i know myself. i am hard working and have a good work ethic. if i put my mind to it, i am certain that i will do fine. i know i'll have to work much harder, but i'm okay with it. also, because i got off the waitlist this late, housing and course registration could be a struggle. i feel like those are short term costs because it's a quarter system, so even if i ended up with a bad schedule, i'd still catch up to the other freshman by the next quarter. the worst case is i'd have to end up in temporary housing, but it wouldn't be for long. i am planning to go to grad school if all else fails. maybe i'm naive and that i could just suck it up for 4 years and go somewhere out of state for grad school. but i really just cannot see myself at school B even if it is ""only a few years"". initially, i was going to commit to another OOS school where my major was guaranteed and all aspects were great, but ended up not doing so because of my parents. i wanted to make them happy, but i have regretted turning the school down even now. my parents are well off. we aren't rich, but they are able to afford my tuition pretty much anywhere without the need for financial aid. i understand their concerns for my future and career, but i cannot see myself thriving at the college i am currently at. of course, my happiness is not guaranteed anywhere, even at school A, but that is the risk i am willing to take. i understand that it is a huge gamble. since i'm in the city currently, my mom and i have just been screaming and crying through the phone 24/7. i'm supposed to go back home in a few days, but i only have a few days until i have to make a decision. i realize that if i commit here, i will have to sacrifice many things. i am more than willing to sacrifice my plans to travel/study abroad/sell my car/get a part time job to afford expenses. hell, i would take out loans and pay for half of my tuition. i understand that there is no win-win situation here. regardless of what i choose, someone will be unhappy. ""you haven't started classes, how do you know you will be unhappy at school B? maybe you'll like it"", a lot of people will say. i realize that i'm immature for thinking like this. but, like i said, i am extremely familiar with the school and area. i know the vibe of the students, the environment, and the location. i hate all of it. not once have i felt that i fit in. i've never loved this school. i was born and raised in that town where people are close-minded. if you act or your skin color is even remotely different, you will be shunned. as a minority, i really just want to escape this hell and live in a different environment, even if it's just for 4 years. i promised that if my GPA was not up to their expectations, i'd transfer back to a CC/worse school near home. my mom says that there's no way i could come back to school B because i'd be ""blacklisted"" for withdrawing so late, but i'm not sure if that's true. she's been constantly threatening me, even telling me that she'd sell my dog because i wouldn't be there to take care of her. i haven't been able to sleep or eat for a week because our fighting has taken a toll on me. she's told me that our relationship would forever be ruined if i decide to go to school A and that she'd never forgive me. she also says that everyone else is happily going to school B, so why can't i? ""i'm not special"", as she puts it. a part of me wants to just forget that i even got off the waitlist and go to school B because that was my initial plan. it would make my parents happy and my mom would calm down, but i know i'd never be able to forgive her because of my ""what if i went somewhere else and became happier"" mindset. my dad has told me that he supports whatever decision i make, but has told me that he prefers school B like my mom. i know he wouldn't be too happy in my decision either, but won't upright say it to me like my mom has. i understand where my parents are coming from, truly. they're looking out for my future, and the last thing i want to be is a burden to them. my parents have had to make many sacrifices for me because they are immigrants, and i love them dearly. i am a good student and a good daughter. i have a great work ethic, and i know success will always be in my scope as long as i continue to work hard. i don't know what to do. i probably sound immature and close-minded, but i'm stuck and i feel so miserable. i don't know what to do. my parents are probably right. i've made many bad decisions, and this could affect my entire future, but i'm selfish. i want to make them happy but i also want to look out for myself as well. i don't know what to do",Faculty,High,2.0,web:pullpush:r/college:submission:complaint,High,2,7534,1468,6,parents don't agree with college decisions - help.,0
"Bad roommate experience last year is making me anxious for this year. This is going to be a long post because there are a lot of details I need to include. I’m going back to college in a few days and I’m really stressed out about it. Everything that’s causing me anxiety is related to my living situation and I’ve been trying to put it out of my mind but I just can’t. Last year, I lived in a suite with two other roommates who were awful. I had a single room and we shared a bathroom and that’s all. But these girls were the worst. In the beginning, I tried to speak to them and say hi/bye and I introduced myself first and was very nice. However, after a few weeks, I realized quickly that they didn’t want to speak to me because they wouldn’t reciprocate my energy and chose to ignore me, which is okay. I understand that roommates don’t have to be friends, they just have to tolerate living together. It was just strange because we didn’t even have each other’s phone numbers and no one made an effort to do so. The only reason I had their contact information after a few months into the semester is because they were complaining to my RA that we had no cleaning schedule for the bathroom and they felt like everything was dirty. so my RA suggested that we make a set schedule and we clean and contact each other if needed (essentially we were forced to communicate). In fact, with every small grievance they had, they’d go to the RA instead of speaking about it amongst ourselves so it was overall just extremely awkward living there because no one spoke or acknowledged each others existence. Or so I thought. The situation escalated when I realized they were talking about me behind my back, reporting me to the RA for things I didn’t do, and watching me through their peepholes. I ended up confronting them with my RA present and told them to leave me alone and that they’re bullies and they didn’t even look at me after that. In fact, in our shared bathroom, they would take the toilet paper out, keep it in their rooms and only bring the roll when they had to use it. All the animosity and attempts at bullying really got to me and I was miserable in that living situation. Fast forward to now, it’s a new school year and I’m living with completely different people. The vibe already seems different because they all reached out to me and we’ve told each other some information about ourselves (nothing in depth but it seems friendly). I’m still super anxious about living with these people though. It’s going to me and three other girls living in a 4 bed, 2 bath apt. I’m stressed and overthinking everything and my mind keeps going to the worst places possible. One of my main concerns is that I have a boyfriend and I like to have him over sometimes (nothing excessive but we do hang out). He would never stay for days at a time and he would stay in my room the whole time but I’m really scared about being a nuisance to them or making them uncomfortable in any way. Last semester, there was zero communication between me and the roommates so I had no idea what was happening until my RA had an intervention with me because they had constantly been reporting me for things I didn’t do, such as leaving the bathroom dirty or slamming doors. They also told my RA that my boyfriend is over and he needs to stay in his own room (which she defended me on and said that one of the other girls constantly had her bf over so they were being unfair to pass judgement on me). I also want to include that they wanted me to scrub the shower floors, the sinks and the toilets and had very high standards for how our bathroom should look. I’m not a messy or dirty person and I just used the bathroom normally but I didn’t go out of my way to scrub the grout from the tiles (which is one of their main complaints). However, I didn’t know they felt this way until the RA intervention. This is why I felt incredibly blindsided, especially because they were holding me to a standard that I didn’t know I was being held to. Also they admitted to not liking me and they even texted me aggressive things that sounded as though they wanted to fight me after my door slammed due to the wind by accident. I understand that I’m not perfect but no one is and I’ve had messy/gross roommates before and I’m not that at all. No one I lived with before ever had a problem with me so everything felt extremely personal in this situation and I don’t get it I try to be a very kind person and I am generally very liked. I make friends wherever I go and I have been told I’m very kind to those around me. That experience last year really shook my perception of myself and now I’m very worried that I’m a terrible person to live with and that next year, it’ll be more drama. I just want to go to class, focus on building my career, and spending time with those who matter to me and I don’t want any issues going forward. I’m interested in what everyone else’s thoughts are on the situation and if I’m spiraling for no reason.

"Got approved to study abroad - should I do it. For context I'm a second year student with 55 credits earned, I'll have 86 by the time the spring semester is over. I applied to study abroad over the summer in Italy, the program lasts for about 3 weeks during late May, early June. The program includes two English courses that would really help me out and I think I'd really enjoy- I'm a double major in English and History. Problem is, of course, money, but I'm working on convincing my parents to let me go as they said from the get go they'd fund my education, whatever form that takes that isn't covered by scholarships. Program fee and tuition is about 7k but includes housing, transportation in Italy, food, a spending stipend, etc. Only thing not covered really is my plane ticket there and back, which is about $800-1k from what I've researched. But I am looking into a few 1k scholarships so hopefully that'll make a buffer. Second issue is- I've never been on a plane. I've barely even left my state, and even then it's only for a few days to visit family. I'm an only child and as of right now I don't know anyone going on the trip, and I have had issues in the past with homesickness even though my college is only an hour away from home (I live in a dorm, go home about every two weeks). Heights and the thought of planes terrify me, but I've always thought maybe it isn't so bad. I plug in a movie or music and then crash for the 15~ hour flight and don't think about it too much. My prof who used to head the program even recommended just downing a Nyquil and conking out if it scares me too much, apparently he's done it before with students who freak out on the flight. Third issue is my parents. I think I'd love the trip, even if I may get homesick and maybe the flight isn't the best, because I've dreamed of visiting Italy since I was little. This is a once in a lifetime thing, and my parents don't seem to grasp that. My dad is caught up on all the things that could go wrong, and my mom just supports his every word. I get it, I do, but things could also go wrong from me living on campus. I had a class that didn't let out til 8:30 pm last semester, I could've been r*ped or m*gged. We live in the US Deep South- hurricanes and flooding happen all the time in the city I study in. I haven't been drenched or stuck yet. I've talked to my prof, the one who used the head the program, and in the ten years he did so (his last trip was two years ago) he never had anyone get lost, break anything, have anything stolen, nothing. They have protocols in place. The only time something got stolen was cause a kid left his laptop on the floor of a restaurant and wasn't watching it. But my parents don't seem to grasp this, and I get it I'm their only child and I've never traveled alone like this before, they're gonna be terrified.

"My girlfriend and I have been constantly harassed by her ex-roommate for over four months. Last semester, my girlfriend was roommates with her friend that she met in freshman year. During our first semester of senior year, they lived together off campus, but still near campus. However, they had one major disagreement living together. Basically, the roommate smoked weed, which my girlfriend didn't care that she did, just not in the house if she wasn't going to air it out. The roommate never aired it out and the house smelled like weed for like 2 months. The roommate also had other people live with them rent-free without my girlfriend's consent. At that point, my girlfriend was fed up and after constantly telling her roommate to communicate with her and respect their shared space, the roommate blew up on my roommate and got her friends to come over and verbally attack her to the point where my girlfriend cried and went over to my place. At this point, she stayed with me for about a week. During this week, the roommate's friends called my gf on a No Caller ID as well as sent her an email under an alias under a different name. At that point my gf was fed up and called the school. The school didn't do anything, all they did is move her to a dorm for the rest of that semester. The leasing office also did not do anything, despite the complaints from us as well as the roommates neighbors. The campus police told us to contact the state police, and then the state police told us to contact the campus police. No one has helped. My girlfriend ended up getting a new apartment, but throughout of when my gf was moved to the dorms by the school, her now ex-roommate constantly kept posting about her on her Snapchat, Instagram, and Twitter. At first it was just saying things that were like ""okay whatever"" but then she escalated even further by posting things about me as well as my girlfriends mother. She actively has stalked our socials too. This all happened in October and it's FEBRUARY now. She still to this day constantly posts about us, but now she's escalated into using alt accounts to stalk my girlfriend's socials and repost them on her Twitter while making fun of us. She also has posted information about our sex life and other private things on social media WHILE USING OUR NAMES, so I created a document of all the things she did and said towards us and sent it to the school. They said they can't do anything, because technically she has 1st amendment rights, and she's allowed to post on her socials, because it's along the same lines like if she were gossiping about a celebrity or whatever. I'm lost. We both are. For four months we've faced constant harassment from this chick and her friends and nobody is doing anything. I need some major advice, or is this like it, do I have to face this harassment until I graduate?

"Pay to play"" in a private school. Extracurriculars are practically bought in this fucking place. You want to get an internship? Pay $2500. Win a competition? Pay $500. Join a prestigious academy? Pay $1000 for tuition. There are plenty of extracurriculars that require no pay, but extracurriculars are being held to a ridiculous fucking standard. Your research papers or patents can be published and approved for some money. You guarantee some sort of dumb fucking award as long as the competition entry fee is high. As a middle class kid, who can barely afford private school tuition but nothing more, my extracurriculars are limited. Dual enrollment costs $500. My parents can't spend that money. It's all fluff. The most superficial person I know in my school pads her extracurriculars with nonprofits, gaining sponsors through her wealthy parents. The same person complained about the difficulty of an AP World History Course. It was moderate in difficulty. The same person tries to fire any teacher that gives her a low score. Looking at her resume alone, she seems like a person with true drive. Never have I once heard the phrase ""I can't afford it"" in my school. Everything academic is first dibs on a wealthy basis. Nearly everyone in my class are paying for their essays. Is that even fucking legal? They enter prestigious SAT academies for thousands a year, and according to a friend, the same academies leak upcoming SAT packets. Because of private school tuition, anyone can take AP courses. My AP World History class is full of ESL students. I was born to English. I learned it at 2. But I'm matched with peers that learned English at 14. I studied 12 hours to get a 100 on all the AP World History tests, while my peers got 75s. But with a barrage of whiny complaints, the grades were inflated once again. Nothing ever feels like it's fucking paying off. When I work my ass off for a high test score, it's negotiated to hold less significance in the overall grade. I worked 45 hours within two days for a tech startup, and I'm currently trying to fill out business forms and contracts for a lotta shit. My wealthy peers have parents that do it all for them, and they get cool investments of $10,000 before they even think of an idea. I don't blame them for being born into a wealthy family. They didn't manipulate some random crapshoot; it's irrational to vilify them for the conditions they were born into. But what really tips me off after is the privilege they exploit. They take their privilege for granted and frown upon the very select few that ACTUALLY work on their extracurriculars. This is just a quick rant, so I apologize for any spelling or grammar mistakes. If you're privileged, exploit that shit by all means. Because changing this pay to play system is impossible. Just please don't take it for granted. Don't shit on your hardworking peers just because their dads don't own companies worth millions. I know plenty of wealthy peers that are perfectly amiable and dedicated--you can be wealthy and hardworking at the same time, but it really pisses me off when they try to dismiss ACTUAL hard work as ""fake.""

It was helpful because the website (or application like AIM or IRC) might crash during submission, so if it did, I wouldn't lose that text (and if I'm on my phone, I still write my comments in Apple Notes before pasting them into the web browser). That kind of orthography doesn't even set off any flags in my mind when reading, but it was actually frustrating for me when iOS started automatically converting my straight quotes to curly quotes (I hate how curly quotes look). Since I have my own non-standard style and orthography, I kind of find it unfair to assume other people with non-standard style are using generative AI. To me it's unfair to make such an accusation (without actual evidence other than style differences), even if it's significantly more likely that they are using generated garbage, because it hurts those of us who don't like the aesthetic decisions of standard style, and nobody shouldn't be forced to change their style just to avoid accusations (I'm obviously ignoring situations where style is mandatory, like in publications or courses that mandate specific style guides.

"Giving Lecture Notes to Students. I teach various math courses and have my own set of lecture notes in addition to the university required textbook. My lecture notes are, well, used to guide when I lecture. I go over them on the board, explain more details in some parts, and cut out other portions during class. I've posted my lecture notes for the course so the students would have access as additional material, but in recent semesters it's started to feel like this is working against me. Students complaining I solely read from my lecture notes and never look back at them (which is false). Or how they had to study everything themselves at home, yet say they also look at my notes that were apparently confusing during class. Also complaints the exams are nothing like the examples in the notes, which is not really true either.

Second Thoughts about my decision. I want to apologize in advance because this might sound ungrateful. I chose USC over Tufts Williams Brown and Cornell for Econ and Business and I have been feeling like I made a mistake. I am in no way trying to make this come off as a complaint because I know I am very lucky to be in this position. I am just thinking about my goal to work on Wall Street and now I’m just worried that because USC isn’t as prestigious I am going to have a much harder time. I chose USC particularly because I felt there was an incredible atmosphere and when I finally visited last month it immediately felt like home. Compared to the other schools where I just couldn’t see myself enjoying my four years there. I’m currently feeling like I should have looked past some of these things and gone to one of these schools.

"Update: Supervisor won't use correct pronouns. Two weeks ago I posted about my supervisor changing my pronouns in a letter I wrote: [https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/nsolaf/supervisor\_wont\_use\_correct\_pronouns/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/nsolaf/supervisor_wont_use_correct_pronouns/) I appreciate the advice and support I got on that post, especially the folks who went to bat for me against bad faith commentary. Thank you! I wanted to write an update for how things have gone since. I spoke with my university's graduate support advisor and he was fantastic. He walked me through the various options available to me as a response. While my gut feeling about the correct course of action remained the same, it was great to get a better sense of what options and resources are available to me and other members of the trans community. This led to a different tack, which I'll get to in a moment. So, I decided that I was going to email my supervisor and lay things out firmly and clearly, asking him to use the correct pronouns in the future. He and I have had a decent camaraderie since even before I came here, but I knew there was so much on the line if I pushed back and he doubled down. I felt a block about actually writing the email. Then, I attended an online conference and got a boost of confidence about my thesis (a professor I admire used similar sources to construct a parallel argument to one of my chapters). I sat down and wrote about that to my supervisor and then threw in a few lines about using my pronouns. A day later he wrote back, apologising for misgendering me and assuring me he won't do it again, and then went into thesis talk around this conference. I'm so relieved! I am so glad I wrote about it, and that my supervisor is understanding and supportive. While I don't think I'll be in a traditional TT academic career, it is great to know that path isn't closed to me by a hostile PhD supervisor. Otherwise, however, things have taken an interesting turn. When the support advisor gave me the rundown of my university's 'Gender Identity and Gender Support Policy' (which itself comes from a legal act!), I asked how their own Academic Registry (AR) still only supports M or F in its database. He didn't believe me until I showed him the screenshots of my requests to AR to fix my student record. The university's own gender support policy explicitly includes non-binary people! I had previously spoken about the limitations of AR's gender scheme to various groups on campus and everyone goes 'that's unfair!', but now we can say, 'that's illegal!' I'm not sure what the next step(s) will be. The support advisor says he's meeting with AR to fix this, but I've been trying for years now and don't have confidence in the process. I don't want to kick up a fuss for its own sake, but I'm much older than most students and I'd rather deal with the harassment and nay-saying myself in order to clear the way for teenagers to have a supportive environment at their university.

"I actually agree that many of the complaints here are are true. The presumption of America as the default and moreover ""the norm"" is how many (maybe even most) of us Americans behave. HOWEVER, what you're asking for (to get academic about it — that is what we do here after all) won't work! Essentially you're trying to cause a mass shift in subcultural ideology through a hegemonic edict. As has been stated several times (downvotes aside) the vast majority (yes, it is a vast simple majority, quite and for the subreddit and quite possibly a vast absolute majority, but if you insist on pedantry we can say a vast plurality) of the redditors here are Americans. So the presumption that they're going to up and move their conversation to a brand new location in favor of a shift of the current location in scope simply because an edict from on high says so is simply impossible. It won't work. Cultural shift just doesn't work that way. It's why it's so hard to just ""end racism"" (or sexism, homophobia, etc) by just saying ""ok, everyone use these new words now!"" Note that the group's description CLEARLY says this group is for discussion of academia, faculty life, and institutional structures and not to be used for homework or admission advice. And yet we get obvious questions from undergrads every day. I actually answer them sometimes because even if off topic, I feel like there's value to us (that is academics) as a culture, if we are welcoming to future generations who are asking questions in good faith even if they don't really understand how they are inappropriate. If the group were to split off a US only segment in all likelihood MOST people just wouldn't bother with switching and we'd just have people complaining that any discussion about R1 job searches was in the wrong group. It certainly won't just magically cause a mass influx of non-US members to join here. I understand people think it will. But that's not how cultural shift works. This is with any domain in a public sphere. You can't ask Black people to go to the black specific POC group so that they other minorities can flourish. You can't ask Marvel fans to stop posting to the comic book group so that indie comics will flourish. As I said in another comment, the most posts here about research or publishing presume that STEM focused rules and practices are standard. There's quite often responses that are essentially opposite what we might do in a humanities field, but we don't want biologists to ask questions about science publishing on academiaSCI so that academiaHUM ""doesn't feel bad"". Because honestly, there's value in me seeing discussions about biology publishing from time to time. Maybe I'll have some sophomore ask me something one day. And just maybe an English phd might have a thought or two that might be relevant every once in a while. And the same thing for the locations. Yes, there's a lot of repeat questions about pretty specific to the US job stuff right now.

"Most common essay writing mistakes (tips from a course instructor). I've been teaching for over ten years and have a sense of what university students most typically struggle with when it comes to essay writing. I've talked with other instructors and put together a quick list of common errors - if you're heading into your first midterms, watch out for these! &amp;#x200B; 1. Not writing an outline first The hardest part of writing is starting to write. It's understandable, then, that a lot of students don't spend enough time planning and writing an outline. You want to get it over with, so you write the introduction first and work the rest out as you go along. However, if you don't have a clear outline, you might find that by the time you get to the end of your essay, the thesis you stated in the introduction has changed. It's always worth doing a lot of your critical thinking before you even begin to write. 2. Writing a lengthy introduction with very general and uninformative claims Many students have the habit of starting their essays by pointing out that their topic has interested historians / philosophers / scientists for hundreds of years or since the beginning of time. Don't do this. It doesn't tell your reader anything important and it makes a bad first impression on your grader. (Sentences like this are a bit of a pet peeve for most professors.) The introduction of a term essay is very different from the introduction of, say, a newspaper article. You need to get right to the point and avoid using too much of a chatty tone. Concisely explain what your topic is and give your thesis statement. 3. Choosing a thesis that is too wide or ambitious *""In this essay, I will argue that nurture is more important than nature.""""In this essay, I will argue that utilitarianism about ethics is right.""* Each of these thesis statements takes on a huge debate. Even if, instead of 2,000 words, you had 10,000, you would not be able to even scrape the surface of these issues. Make sure that the scope of your thesis statement is sufficiently small. This will help you to write a more focused essay, which is what your professors are looking for. For example, you might choose to focus on one particular author's views on utilitarianism and argue that there is a problem with one of his arguments. It's good to be bold, but don't try to take on questions that are so wide in scope that you are forced to give them a superficial answer. 4. Not taking a position in your thesis statement *""In this essay, I will compare different theories of free will - specifically, compatibilism, which says that free will is compatible with causality and libertarianism, which denies this.""""In this essay, I will describe Sigmund Freud's theory of dreaming, focusing on his claims about the purpose of dreaming.""* Your thesis statement should work a bit like a conclusion of an argument - it should follow from your premises. If your thesis statement claims that you will simply 'compare', 'describe', or 'observe' something, this is an indication that you might not be taking enough of a position in your essay. The thesis statements above are not arguing for a position: they are not trying to persuade the reader. (Of course there are exceptions to this rule: some questions specifically ask only for comparisons or descriptions - but most questions do not.) Comparing, observing, or describing are all useful things to do when you are arguing for your thesis, but they shouldn't be **all** that you do in your essay. 5. Sitting on the fence Sitting on the fence in your essay often goes hand in hand with not taking a position in your thesis statement. It's tempting to feel like you just don't know enough about the main topic of your essay to settle the central debates. After all, these debates have typically been going on between experts for many years. Your instructor knows that and isn't trying to catch you out for taking the wrong position on something. What's important is your reasoning and evidence. You are not expected to forever resolve long-standing disputes in just a few short pages. You are expected to take a clear stance based on your evaluation of the argument(s) presented. 6. Mentioning as many arguments as possible This is one of the most common mistakes that students make in essay writing. Let's say that you have a word limit of 1500 words. For an essay like this to be focused and thorough, you should only be exploring one or two arguments at most. Many students think that including four or five arguments in their essays will make for a stronger case (five reasons to agree with the thesis are better one, right?). In actual fact, this almost always leads to a bad essay. Firstly, it's impossible to do justice to so many different ideas using a small number of words. Your treatment of each argument will have to be superficial to stay within the word limit. Secondly, including five different arguments does not allow you to show your good judgement in differentiating the stronger ones from the weaker ones. Picking the strongest two arguments shows your grader that you can discriminate. Thirdly, including many different arguments usually leads to the clarity of the essay suffering. Ideas in these kinds of essays tend to get run together and the reader struggles to keep track of the main line of thought. 7. Quoting too much (or using very long quotations) Many students rely too heavily on quotations. You might think that quoting extensively will show that you have worked really hard on understanding the primary text but in fact this has the opposite effect. Your instructor wants to see that you have understood the material and can explain the ideas independently, in your own words. Be careful not to let quotations do the job of explaining for you. Direct quotation is best used when it is important to establish a writer's exact choice of words. For example, the choice of words may be unclear and you may want to explain why this is and to justify your interpretation of them. A writer might introduce a new term for something and, by using quotation, you can make it clear that this is their term (and not yours). Finally, quotations are useful if you want to provide evidence for a particular claim in your argument (for instance, when you quote an expert). 8. Not including any references While some students fill their essays with quotations, others forget to include any at all. Make sure to include a few quotations in your essay to support your claims, particularly if you are analysing another writer's work. Additionally, when you give your exposition, you should be paraphrasing some of the ideas that you are explaining (that is, you should be putting the ideas into your own words). And when you paraphrase something from a primary text, you can reference it: cite the source and page number after your paraphrase just as you would with a quote. While page numbers are optional in paraphrase citations, they do show your reader that you understand exactly where the claim is coming from and that your engagement with the original material has been really thorough. 9. Stating rather than showing When you are arguing that another position is wrong, it is really important to show why this is. Claiming that their overall conclusion is false or implausible is not enough here. You need to explain to your reader exactly why the other position is a bad one. To do this, you cannot presuppose any agreement with your position: assume a neutral reader who needs persuading on the matter. 10. Appealing to the dictionary definition of a concept Getting started with an analytical essay can be difficult. The first step that many students take is to reach for the dictionary definition of their topic. Here the dictionary definition is typically not used to make a specific point about language but is rather used as a way to introduce discussion. Not only is this not helpful to the substance of the essay, but it usually serves as a red flag to the grader that the writer was running out of time or ideas. Because this is such a common (and unhelpful) student writing technique, it has come to annoy professors. Resist the temptation to start your essay like this! 11. Using non-academic language This guide is not written in academic language. There are many contexts where it's perfectly fine to use informal, concise, or even slang language. However, for academic essays, you have to adopt a different style of writing. In academic writing you should avoid using any colloquial vocabulary. For example, don't use phrases like ""above board"", ""pretty decent"", and ""not great"". Don't use contractions like ""don't"", ""can't"", and ""won't"" - write out the full words. Academic writing should have a formal tone and should be as clear and precise as possible. Non-academic writing style: *""In this essay I will talk about how the canon isn't wide enough. I feel like these days so much good abstract art is made and ignored by people who study art history.""*Academic writing style: *""In this essay I will argue that the canon of art history is not sufficiently inclusive. Specifically, I will suggest that it ought to include more contemporary, abstract art.""* 12. Using strawman arguments The function of a scarecrow is to scare birds away from crops by appearing to be a person. On closer examination, it just looks like sticks and straw. A strawman argument is a reconstruction of an argument that has the appearance of being like the original, but, on closer examination, is in fact much weaker. Strawman arguments are of course easier to criticize. Be careful that you aren't unfairly attributing a weakened position to someone in this way. If your take on the writer whose work you have been asked to analyze is that they are completely incompetent, re-examine your analysis. The principle of charity recommends that we present the strongest possible version of any opposing arguments. This will make your own arguments stronger. Showing that you can deal with a weak objection doesn't do much for your case. Showing that you can deal with the strongest possible objection to your argument is very persuasive. 13. Putting new things in your conclusion Conclusions should bring together the results of your essay. In a sense, they are a kind of mirror image of introductions. Do not use your conclusion to add further reasons to agree with your main thesis - this work should have already been done by this point in the essay. Explain to the reader what you were able to show in your essay. How did you prove your thesis? What, very briefly, was the reasoning you used? You might want to include a sentence or two explaining the implications of what you have shown for some wider context in society or for the future of research in your area. There's no need to be too bold here - you're not expected to revolutionize anything. Think of the kind of thing you might say if you were explaining to someone why your conclusion is interesting in a more general way. 14. Trying to get around the word limit with font size or margin adjustments Let's say you've been working all day on your essay and you've ended up 500 words over your word limit. If you're feeling really invested in what you've written - or just too lazy to edit it down - you might be tempted to try to adjust some visuals on your essay to make it look shorter. If 2,000 words is 8 pages double-spaced, then how about narrowing the margins and changing the font size to 11? The problem with this is that, though the layout might not look all that different to you after these changes, it will look strikingly different to the 40 other essays your professor has just graded. Most course instructors will allow you to go 5 or 10% over the word limit, but disguising an extra 500 words is not going to work! Avoid any last-minute panic by making sure that you have a strict word budget in your essay plan. 15. Underestimating the importance of editing your final draft It's easy to miss this step if you are working to a deadline but it is one of the most impactful stages of the writing process. The overall impression that your essay makes is very influential on a grader. Lots of typos, grammatical errors, and unclear sentences will exhaust your grader and can potentially undermine your hard work. One great way to check for clarity is to ask a peer who is not in your class to read through your essay: if they can understand it all without guidance, that's a good sign. If they can't, ask them to highlight which sentences are unclear. Try to get some distance from your work before reading through it yourself. Leave your draft alone for a day or two and then edit it with fresh eyes. If you're running short on time, one way to quickly create distance from your work is to read it aloud and imagine that you have an audience. Do your explanations sound clear? Are any of your sentences too long? Does your essay fulfill the promise of the introduction? Review 1. Not writing an outline first 2. Writing a bad introduction 3. Thesis too wide or ambitious 4. Not taking a position (thesis) 5. Sitting on the fence 6. Mentioning too many arguments 7. Quoting too much 8. Not including any references 9. Stating rather than showing 10.

"Not all CO'25 rants are built equal; a quick overview of the A2C rant meta. Not all CO'25 rants are built equal. No philosophical build up, let's jump in. There are two types of CO'25 rants. You have the prescriptive rants, like ones that use language along the lines of ""don't you dare"". These will get responses (ei the ""badapple"" response). Then, there are reflective rants. For example look to, ilyMIT's response to the badapple response. I would claim it to be a pseudoresponse because the two posts don't actually disagree with each other; the main complaint aired by badapple was CO'25 bumming CO'24 out. ilyMIT only talked about how our application cycle sucked, but nothing in the post was PRESCRIPTIVE so nothing there to ""scare juniors"", as badapple complains about. Overall, I think the current meta probably favors reflective rants. As such, I don't think badapple will respond to ilyMIT's response. The warrant for this is that many juniors/rising seniors kinda want CO'25 to stay in their lanes. This doesn't mean don't rant - by all means, share your pain. But a strategic ranter who wants to avoid the wrath of CO'24 will avoid the claim that the cycle will be any easier (or harder) for any other generations. Thus, a reflective ranter maximizes his or her (or zer) rant juice to lashsback ratio - after all, empirically, we see that only by prescribing action do you invoke lashbsack.

"Starting over"". I am currently a junior at a four-year university. I was a good high school student and managed to secure a full scholarship to my local uni but due to health issues of both the mental and physical kind, I have been unable to perform effectively in college and will likely lose my academic and housing scholarships this semester. I started as a computer science major and in my zeal to learn more about computing, I completely disregarded my basic sciences freshman year. In the middle of my sophomore year, I realized that I was more interested in medical research than software engineering (which is what my school's CS program essentially amounts to). I am now struggling in intro-level sciences because the last time I took basic sciences was in high school and I never developed the study habits for learning material that disinterested or did not come easily to me. Due to my awkward course completion and late change of heart, my graduation date is delayed until Spring 2017 at the earliest. Ideally, I would like to start over. The tuition for my university is too high without a scholarship so I'm thinking of transferring to a two-year, redoing calculus, taking my biological science pre-reqs, and then attempting to secure a transfer to a cheaper four year if scholarships are inaccessible. I am hoping that a community college environment will allow me a little more breathing room and support so that I can learn some effective life and study skills while also allowing me time to get a better handle on my health. Also, when I do begin the four year search again, I will know what to look in a university that I was ignorant of the first time around.

"Masters in Social Work (in U.S.) or Masters in International Development and Economics (in Germany). Hi everyone! Asking for some guidance here on grad school and career prospects. I have two main routes I am considering: A Master's in Social Work in my home country of the US, or a Masters in International Development and Economics in Berlin, Germany. My work background is in refugee resettlement, specifically in economic development programming. I loved this work - I loved the mix of client-facing and administrative tasks, and I loved making an impact. But the pay is crap and I do not want to be broke forever. Since I was young, I have wanted to be a therapist on and off. This is where the MSW would come in - I would focus on clinical, seek licensure, and work in private practice. This could be lucrative, but of course, you never really know. But I feel fairly confident that this could give me a decent salary around 6 figures once I have licensure and work for a few years. Theoretically, I could also work in other realms of social work (i.e. in policy) but I am concerned about salary. My desire to be a therapist is currently complicated by some pretty intense mental health struggles I've been facing for about 6 months. Severe depression and anxiety, and asking the essential questions - ""Would I really make a good therapist? Could I really do this? Can I really hold space for others in the way they need? Or do I want a more emotionally divested job?"" I do not know what the Masters in International Development Economics career path would look like. Graduates from this program work all over the world in banks, policy, program management, and trade. I do not know what these salaries are like but I am guessing it varies widely based on location and organization. My guess is there are many people who don't make great money, and some who make decent money, and maybe even some who make great money if they are in the finance and trade sectors. On the other hand, I know pretty clearly what a Masters in Social Work would look like: clinical work, licensure, therapy. Decent salary. I should mention the German program is 2500 euro total, compared to 6 figures of debt for many American programs. This is certainly a draw to the German program, but I cannot get a sense of the ROI. I should also mention I am completely enamored with Berlin. I've been having thoughts of moving there for about a year, and in some deep pits of depression, I would have done anything for the opportunity to uproot my life and be where I felt I belong, in Berlin. I have to decide yes/no on the German program in about two weeks. So: do I move to Berlin and study International Development and Economics with a somewhat unsure career path, but live in a city I adore and graduate with basically no debt and an uncertain future? Or do I stay in the states, study social work, be a therapist like I wanted since I was young (but I am not sure I want now, though I do not know if these doubts are stemming from mental illness) and have a pretty clear picture of my career and salary?

"Professor doesn’t know how to teach course, should I drop. Hi guys, I tried to post this in r/college but it was removed and someone suggested I post here instead: Hi everyone, I’m 21(F) and graduated with my BS last semester, but am currently finishing up my pre-reqs for pharmacy school at my local community college. I preface with this to say that I understand difficult professors, I have had many of them, but I think this situation is a bit different and I’m not sure what to do. I’m in a class right now where the professor was just hired the week before classes started. The course is very structured, the department sets the schedule, and all the labs, lectures, exams, quizzes, and assignments are the same for all the different sections with all the different professors. The thing is, this professor seems to have absolutely no idea what is going on, and is making zero effort to understand. We had a lab the other day and the assignment said that he should grade our slides in the lab before turning in the report. When I asked him to grade my slide, he looked at me as if I had three heads and said that we just fill out the report provided to us… when this is exactly what the report said to do. I’m not sure he even looked at the assignment in the first place. Class started January 26th, we don’t have the syllabus still, only got the lecture schedule yesterday, through which I found out we have an exam and lab quiz on Monday. Again, he did not mention this at all, and honestly, I’m not even sure he knows the exam is on Monday. He admitted last lab that he hasn’t familiarized himself with the lab schedule, even though we are 3 weeks in. Were supposed to have assignments online through Pearson, which were supposed to start at the beginning of the semester, but he has no idea how to set the Pearson course up and still hasn’t figured it out, which is crazy to me considering our first exam is on Monday. I’m really worried that I will not pass this class due to this professor, not because of my own skills. I’ve passed organic chem, physics, etc with good grades and now that I’m so close to finishing my pre requisites, I don’t want to risk a bad grade over a professor. The deadline to drop without a W is coming up in a couple days, and I’m really conflicted. I’ve only ever withdrawn from a course once, and that’s because I was struggling.

"Roommate uses mental illness to guilt trip me whenever I try to communicate about respect and shared responsibilities. Am I overreacting. This post started as me venting to the Notes app on my phone, but I would to know if anyone has been in a similar situation or has any insight into how I can approach this issue respectfully. I'm a sophomore living in an off-campus apartment, and this year I moved in with a friend from freshman year. She claims to have a pretty extensive list of *undiagnosed* mental illnesses, including depression, panic disorder, social anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, etc. As mental illness is very prominent in my family, I have observed all of these disorders first hand and am aware how difficult it can be to keep up with depression/anxiety alone. She is an extremely social and self-assured person so her behavior isn't necessary consistent with what I have seen from what I've seen in family members, but I'm not going to judge or invalidate anyone's personal hardships. For this reason, I try my best to be accommodating of the struggles she claims to be dealing with. However, I am unsure of where do draw line line between being understanding her difficulty in performing daily tasks and falling to a manipulative relationship. I have a feeling that I've shifted towards the latter, but here's my list of generic roommate complaints: &amp;#x200B; * At the beginning of the school year **when we decided who would get which room, she demanded to have the master’s bedroom**, gave a strange excuse for why she ""needed"" it, and was unwilling to consider my perspective. I didn’t care much so I agreed (I lived in the old dorms last year so I’m honesty just happy to have air conditioning and hot water) but I did ask her how many days per week she planned on living at our apartment; I live here full-time (including breaks) while she only has class for a few days each week and often goes home when she doesn’t have school. She insisted that she would also be living here full-time (this was a change from her original plan to live here half-time), so I just went with it, but that has definitely not been the case. This is not a huge issue, but it definitely foretold the attitude I've dealt with ever since. * **I’ve been managing all of our utility bills since we’ve moved in, and she has never payed me her half** ($700+ at this point). Her parents are paying her rent so I know that I will be reimbursed eventually, but it has still been really stressful for me. At this point I’ve already done everything that I can to make it easy for her and all she really has to do is Venmo me. * **She does absolutely nothing in terms of consistent cleaning/maintenance.** I could go on for a while about this, but I'll just list some trends. * Leaving dishes in her room for days/weeks/months until we run out of plates, utensils, whatever. We once had a mouse visit us for a little while, and she said it was my fault because I have a sealed bag of clothes under my bed (and not because she leaves food and dirty dishes in her room). * Leaving dishes in the sink. I hand wash my dishes after using them, and I don't expect her to do the same, but I would still like to be able to use my sink. * Letting dishes sit in our dishwasher until I do them * Putting dirty dishes back in our cupboards (this one really bugs me) * Leaving rotting food in our refrigerator until I throw it out * I swear, she has not once taken out our trash/recycling (we've been living here for six months) * Leaving her clothes in our dryer for days/weeks, preventing me from doing laundry for days/weeks * **Her boyfriend lives here for days at a time. and they spend those days in front of a very loud TV that I bought. This also considerably increases the number of dishes left sitting in common places, the sink, etc.** **She never spoke to me before this started, and she doesn't need my permission, but in that position I definetly would have definitely given her a head's up. I have absolutely no problem with visits/sleepovers, but its gotten to the point where they monopolize common areas for days and I feel confined to my own room.** * This is more odd than it is truly concerning, but **she NEVER knocks before opening my door.** She’s woken me up EARLY in the morning by just unapologetically strolling into my room. I would never do this to her or anyone, so it makes me pretty uncomfortable. * There was another weird steak of about four months when she would always leave our front door unlocked/ajar at night (and then blame it on me), so I had to make it a routine to always check before going to bed. **She has other strange habits like this that force me to compensate by making adjustments to my own lifestyle.** * **She is not at all open to having an adult conversation about my wish to get a pet.** Just to clarify, I would never expect her to take responsibility for feeding/caring for my pet, I am really just asking her to coexist with it (kind of like how I have to coexist with her loud af boyfriend). I love animals and having cats throughout my childhood has helped me a lot with anxiety, but again, she will not even entertain the thought as it might pose a slight/occasional inconvenience to her ""when she has to SEE an animal"" (her words). **This is somewhat understandable and probably appears reasonable to an outsider, but the fact that she is unwilling to explain her reasoning (or even acknowledge my concerns) feels unfair to me and it reflects her unwillingness to listen when I try to communicate.** I've tried holding off on performing certain chores to see if she will eventually cave, but I have found that she will allow out trashcan to overflow before taking it out. I'm really not sure if she doesn't care or if she just knows that I will eventually deal with it, but I'm not sure how to reason with someone who refuses to hear another person's concerns and uses mental illness as a way to guilt trip others. Does anyone have any experience dealing with this type of roommate, or have any suggestions on how I can respectfully assert myself?",Hostel,Medium,1.0,web:reddit:r/college:search:complaint,Medium,1,6103,1106,9,Roommate uses mental illness to guilt trip me whenever I try to communicate about respect and shared responsibilities.,0

"Is it worth getting an apartment instead of living in the dorms if I can afford it. I’m going into my second year of college, and I’m debating whether to stay in the dorms again or move into an off-campus apartment. I lived in the dorms last year and while it was convenient, it was also noisy, cramped, and honestly just kind of exhausting being surrounded by people 24/7. I get that it’s part of the “college experience,” but I’m wondering if having my own space might help me focus better, sleep better, and just feel more like an adult. Financially, I’ve got a bit more flexibility this year - so I could afford a small apartment without wrecking my budget, especially if I get a roommate. It wouldn’t be luxurious or anything, but it’d give me a kitchen, some quiet, and probably fewer fire alarms at 3AM. My only concern is whether I’ll miss out socially. Most of my friends are still in the dorms, and I don’t want to isolate myself too much. That said, I’m also starting to value peace and alone time more than constant chaos.

"Letter to Reps Regarding NIH 15% cap. Hi all, I wrote a letter to my representatives today regarding the NIH cap. I'm putting it here too and wanted to encourage you to send something similar to your reps! And, you can find who your local officials are here: [https://www.usa.gov/elected-officials](https://www.usa.gov/elected-officials) Please repost in relevant reddit threads, and if anyone has made something similar for other policies impacting researchers right now, please also add those here! EDIT: Folks are right that you should call as well! This is a very helpful tool going around social media for making calls: [https://5calls.org/](https://5calls.org/) Dear Congressman, I hope this letter finds you well, and I would like to express my deep concern about the recently proposed budget cuts to overhead fees for the National Institutes of Health (NIH; https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-25-068.html). This would have major impacts on research in the United States, such as the research of health and diseases that affect many people – including your constituents. I am troubled by comments suggesting that indirect costs are unnecessary or unimportant. First and foremost, the majority of indirect fee percentages are not even set by the NIH; rather, they are most often established by the HHS Division of Cost Allocation or the Department of Defense’s Office of Naval Research (https://www.niaid.nih.gov/grants-contracts/know-basics-facilities-and-administrative-costs). Thus, attempting to gut the NIH budget rather than reforming the way that other departments calculate overhead fees is simply misguided. Further, it is important to recognize that while these fees can be high, they cover quite a lot. Other than simple administrative costs, they aid in chemical waste management, proper storage of animals and chemicals, maintenance fees for machines, electricity, water, and janitorial fees. Additionally, indirect costs allow for administrative assistance in submitting NIH grants – this is a complicated process that can and should be reformed, however, I am concerned that there has been no discussion of reforming federal grant submissions. I am greatly disturbed by the potential implications of these policies. While the United States is currently a world leader in scientific innovation and research, many laboratories would be forced to close their doors under these policies, and I foresee the US quickly losing its status as a top tier country for research. These budgetary cuts also make little financial sense, as every $1 used for NIH-funded research is more than doubled in return at $2.46 (https://www.fiercebiotech.com/research/report-every-dollar-nih-research-funding-doubles-economic-returns). Most academic institutions will not use their endowments – if they have them (many state universities do not have large endowments) – to cover these losses and aid a department that is not making them any money. Further, NIH policies do not allow for researchers to use funding for direct costs for indirect costs, leaving researchers at a stand-still. I would also like to provide you with a more personal story of how this will impact your constituents, such as myself, and academic research. (add personal story here if you want) These changes will force a lot of progress to be lost and will impact everyone, especially those in rural areas who have less access to medical care. I sincerely hope that you can take action on this pressing issue, advocate for this funding to not be cut, and work to ensure that our tax dollars are used in a way that enables important scientific research to continue and thrive – allowing the US to remain number one in innovation and discovery.

"Students Have Decided They Have a “Collective Preference” Not to Complete an Assignment. I receive a lot of crap, especially as young female faculty, but this has to be top 5. Students have been working on a group project throughout the semester for a class, and are scheduled to present on their projects this week. Student teams each picked their presentation times over a month in advance. Over the weekend a student emailed me with his teammates cc'd, stating that their team would not be able to present on their project this week, as several of their team members are involved in the capstone program run for graduating seniors, and those team members happen to be presenting for their capstone projects the same day as their scheduled class presentation. This student likely didn't anticipate me having access to the capstone presentation schedule. When I pulled it up, I found that just one student of their entire group is even participating in a capstone project this semeter, and no, they're not presenting for that on the same day that they're scheduled to deliver their presentation in my class. When I pointed this out and asked for clarification on this discrepancy, the student replied, ""we would like to be transparent"" (translation: we didn't expect you to catch us lying), and ""as a team, we have decided that we do not want to present our project. There are no schedule conflicts that prevent us from presenting. It is simply a collective preference"". I try not to let students get to me, but truthfully, I can't help being a little angry. Don't we ""collectively"" not want to pay our bills, pay taxes, or go to work sometimes? But we're functioning adults, so we do these things. Additionally, many of their peers in the class are graduating seniors presenting for their capstones this week, yet those peers are also completing their presentations for my class without issue - so why would this team deserve preferential treatment?

But not because of your nationality, not because of your hypothetical exceptional position. Are there any serious discussions that any researcher that is from the US will have a increased salary? The discussions I have noticed is for leading figures in their domain to have such benefits. something that it's was happening anyway, but with an additional influx of Americans at the moment, the additional funds may not be enough to cover such differences. &gt;But not because of your nationality, not because of your hypothetical exceptional position.

Fight back, while you can. I am not sure what ""global equality"" means in terms of research. Who wants that, seriously, and why? We should want meritocracy in research. I don't want my money to fund poor quality research for the X (irrelevant to the scientific process) factors. I want my money to push forward our specific knowledge and boundary of possible.

"Tales from a TA. So this past summer I was a TA for a programming class in my department. We had a full class (30 people?), 1.5 hours everyday for a month. Standard summer lower middle level class. I surprised my self and learned everyone's names by end of week 2. This had something to do with the professor assigning homework every night and classwork every day, all of which had to be graded, one by one, by yours truly. If i had time/oppritunity, I would also help people in class but usually that was what the professor did during class. I was the grader, she was the tutor. Really weird relationship there. Since I spent so much time with literally everyone in the class, I got to know a few of them really well. For instance, I had a degree seeking Mother of 4 (all of who were in college or had graduated). She and the two guys sitting next to her (friends of her kids) were the highlight of every class. The 3 of them knew each other since dirt so it was always a good time when I was helping them. I was also taking classes for my degree while i was teaching. I was taking the 2nd freshman seminar that my University doesn't force you to take freshman year (BIG mistake, Take them freshman year!). SOOOOOOO much writing. The prompts were 95% the same every time. anyways. Mother of 4 was literally a life saver. She had taken the same class with the same professor and ~~helped me with~~ pretty much wrote my final paper. She saved me from getting a C in that class. She also heavily helped her 2 neighbors. I could never find any evidence of cheating (which is hard to detect in programming, there are only so many ways to do something without be overly roundabout) but i knew she was holding their hands quite a bit. but they all passed their final which included the professor asking specific question about their code, requiring detailed knowledge about how it works. They were great. I would stay back well after my office hours were over just to hangout with them while they were doing their homework. Another note: Grading SUCKS SO MANY DICKS. For Exams, Professor gave me an answer key and point-per-question breakout and let me loose. Determining how to evenly do partial credit across a class is difficult (trick to this: mark everything wrong on every paper and then go back and assign points, substantially more time but saves you from getting people pissed at you for unfair grading). Giving someone a 7/100 when they attempted every question is difficult. Having to tell someone that the problem is wrong many times and they can't leave until they get it right or get a 0 is difficult. I'm a student, I know the pain of getting a 7 on a test I studied for. Point to this is, until you are 100% convinced that your TA or Professor is 100% heartless, they probably hurt a little when you get a bad grade or they see you let down. Cut them a break. Generally, they aren't trying to ruin your life. Looking forward to this next semester where I'm TAing for 2 classes and taking 14 hours of my own :) all of that and still don't have any Friday classes",Academic,Medium,1.0,web:reddit:r/college:search:unfair grading,Medium,1,3071,568,0,Tales from a TA.,0
"&gt;”*On the premed track; I know as an intl it’s a wild ride but that’s what I plan on doing atm*” I think we’ve had this conversation before. I would not choose your undergrad school based on being “pre-med” Your characterization of being on the premed track as being “a ride” of any sort includes a tacit — and fatally flawed — assumption that you’ll get anywhere on that ride. For completeness, i’ll append my reply to your earlier post here… As an international student your chances of getting accepted to a US medical school are effectively zero… no matter where you attend college. Out of roughly 33,000 US medical school enrollees in the most recent year, fewer than 200 were not US citizens. - The vast majority of those 200 people were Canadian - The bulk of the remainder were people with specific refugee/asylum status, or those who were already in the process of getting a green card at the time of application The problem is that US medical schools will not accept anyone who is not eligible to enter a US medical residency program upon graduation from medical school. But medical residents in the US are employees, not students. So an international will not be eligible to be employed by a US residency program. Residency programs, with few exceptions, will not provide visa sponsorship. So the likelihood that you will get accepted to a US medical school is effectively zero",Other,Medium,1.0,web:pullpush:r/ApplyingToCollege:comment:problem,Medium,1,1390,242,16,&gt;”*On the premed track; I know as an intl it’s a wild ride but that’s what I plan on doing atm*” I think we’ve had this conversation before.,0
"Late Allowances for Student Giving Birth. A (graduate) student of mine started the semester pregnant with their first child and it is here. I tried to get a convo going before the baby came regarding assignment due dates, but the student insisted turning in assignments on time will be a problem. They emailed me FROM LABOR to say they will try to not miss any due dates (our next is Monday). To be clear, I think this is literally the best excuse to miss a due date and I would agree to most anything they proposed, but they seem adamant to hold themselves to the same standards as students not producing a human this week which seems unrealistic and unnecessarily stressful.

"Opinions about the usage of social media for academic purposes. Hey all. I have a dilemma and would benefit from hearing your opinions. I understand people in academia (students, researchers, professors) use social media (Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook) to promote their work, get exposure, build an online network. But is this becoming a necessity in the academic line of business? Can one ""survive"" without a strong online presence? Let me stress out that I am not against this, it has great utility. I just fear that with no rules, it breeds some unfair practices that must be questioned. My personal experience so far is that certain people become ""social media"" superstars and get better opportunities than other people with similar or even better professional qualifications but no online presence. I cannot help but get confused by the images academic people project in the online sphere, all polished and idealistic, carefully marketed. Isn't it dysfunctional when this matters more than academic merit? Do you have similar experiences? Additionally, I have just been exposed to what I consider a ""toxic"" case of academic social media usage. In my workplace, the group leader and many members extensively use social media. They post only about certain people in the group they like, while the others are left out. The whole group dynamic has thus become a popularity contest ""I got posted online, I am so cool"". Is this how a research group is supposed to use social media? I have to mention I am in no way a narrow-minded, jealous or overly sensitive person who just likes to complain. I am genuinely confused by these observations. Let me know your thoughts on these matters.

"Went to college, got my BA but too poor for grad school. How do I stay on top of my education self studying. Hi everyone! I hope this is a good sub to post this in. I have had this in mind since my senior year of university. Honestly.I feel like I have gotten dumber. I was doing okay when I transferred to a 4 year, and then socially kind of sh\*t the bed at college and became a shut in. I think it made me depressed, which made my study and work quality get worse. Add in ChatGPT, and now I can't even tell you the last time I finished a required reading. My last essay was probably a year ago? I miss school, and learning things that aren't related to corporate busywork I do not care about. I think I am missing a thirst for knowledge. The issue is that I absolutely NEED a classroom setting (lectures, assigned readings, tests, essay questions) and (edit): added this sentence) I need it to be free/accessible through university libraries or the internet. Trying to do this on my own has just led me to procrastinate and now that I am even more worried about our future as a democracy, I realize I realllyyyy need to stay on top of being educated and literate. My friends are likely all smarter than me, I look back on things I aligned with ignorantly and not maliciously, just lacking the knowledge about what I was supporting fully. I feel ashamed, and want to get smarter but I guess I need to know: 1. What level am I supposed to start at when learning something new? This is my biggest question. The issue is I either overestimate or underestimate my level, which leads to me giving up when it is hard or getting bored when it is easy.I also am having trouble with timelines. EX: I have been curious about history but where do I even begin? Prehistoric times? I have been considering just going through a curriculum for like middle/high school kids to refresh my memory but even saying that makes me feel so embarrassed for some reason. 1.1) How effective are podcasts, documentaries, things I can watch or listen to on the go? This would probably be helpful for when I am trying to work or workout and can multitask. 2) How do I stay organized and avoid burnout? I would need to be doing this while also working a full time, demanding, understaffed job. By the time I get home I am usually brain dead so the thought of having to retest myself on 10th grade math is not appealing. 3) Trying to do all of this while trying to apply to grad school the following cycle? Too late for ~~C/O~~ (edit: reworded) application cycle 2025 but in a great position to find letters of rec and figure out what to do. I don't think I have a choice but to go back to school but I am not sure what I would go for or how I would afford it. I know it sounds crazy to talk about retaking high school classes and grad school in the same post, but I need the refreshers because I am scared of how much education I have forgotten. I used to be semi-good at Spanish and now I can't hold a conversation. I feel like I don't know anything at all and that worries me.

penn state vs rutgers. I need to decide which school to go to today and i’m so lost so im hoping someone can help me. I can go to Penn State. This is the school i always wanted. This is a school i thought i could never get into because i look at the stats of others who were way more involved in the duration of their high school than i and they still didn’t get into the main campus. The second i got home i checked and it said i was accepted into main campus I began to cry right away. If i go to Penn State it helps knowing that I won’t be alone so far away from home in a school where I know absolutely no one and I would room with my friend. I feel like this is the school I have to go to. This is the school I should be at. When we went and visited Penn State the second we stepped out the car and I saw the stadium I was in complete awe and thought it felt right and I was able to picture my future there. I feel like I need to do it because I didn’t think I was able to and others thought I couldn’t either. Especially a counselor of mine who told me that if I didn’t take calculus this year Penn State would never accept me I could also go to Rutgers. It’s a nice school and drive able from the house so if for whatever reason I don’t want to be there I could leave and be at my house within fourty five minutes. I would have to find a roommate but i have four friends who are going. The idea of going to any school in general completely alone is terrifying to me.

"Thank you for the response. Just for context, I have an attendance policy for several reasons. First, I have an attendance policy because you have to provide documentation if a student fails the course. Also, you have to send progress reports to the student. If a student doesn't show up to class, then that might explain why they are failing. Second, it allows me to check-in on a student. If a student misses a lot of classes I reach out to them and ask what's going on. A lot of these students have medical issues, financial hardships, mental health issues, or family/friend deaths. Then, I connect these students to student affairs and they can get the support and resources they need. I refer around 4 students every 2 weeks or so. Most of our students don't know they have counseling and other university offices that can assist them. If I didn't take attendance, it would be a challenge to provide this kind of support.

Shared the Joy with my parents. \[Before I say anything more, I am introverted, more introverted than introverted people, although I can talk to people fairly normally and even start discussions myself, I still feel uneasy when talking with people. And it doesn't help I never went outside a lot. I stutter sometimes, rarely but it makes me embarrassed.\] Anyways, there was a month left before the classes started, and the whole month I was fine. No sadness, no feelings about leaving anyone or anything I was normal. But came the day I left, it was weird, I felt sad but I still powered through but the moment I entered my hostel (my first time living in one), I felt extremely sad but I thought I could still go on, well I had to it WAS my decision. But with each passing day I feel more disheartened, It's not getting better I just think why I came here. Even my dreams are doing me bad reminding me of them. And doing this for 4 years without them, they will grow old, I wanna be with them. My parents (mostly father) used to tell me I should take admission near our home but I was bent on going to a big uni away from home. I wish I had listened to him. Foolish me always disobeying his experience. Now the major thing is my GPA is gonna get FINISHED. I literally don't do anything, no games on my laptop which I used to do all day, no anything productive which I used to do, no studying which I used to do day and night for my uni exams, no fixing my diet (infact I am missing meals) which I was fixing before, and worse of all no studying. It's not that I am lazy, I did all this before. I just am too much in a weird spot I don't wanna do anything. I got a couple days free and instead of thinking about doing my assignments I just sat thinking about my life. I wake up with the shittiest feeling I have ever felt everyday. So here are my options which I also discussed with my parents: **1.** I remain in this university, somehow power through but at the cost of my GPA, possibly miss classes because of my feelings, possibly worse health and chance of repeating the semester because of poor grades. \[Parents like this one\] **2.** I go to a worse university near my home, live with my parents, take classes daily, learn some side skills from 1st semester, overall better experience for me, and no chance of semester repeat and graduating with a good GPA (hopefully). The problem is the deadline for application submission and test is a week and 10 days, I don't have nearly enough time to try out the uni I am at currently. \[**Note**: The university branch I am thinking of going to is a worse one but overall the Main University Campus is just a level below the one I am going to right now, so locally the degree of this university also holds some value locally, for going abroad it doesn't matter just good GPA does\] My parents say I should just go here and say repeat the semester if I mess up but I don't wanna waste time. I already wasted it a lot. **In need of serious guidance, please guide me properly. Thank you!** **TLDR; Entered a university far from home in a hostel, is not settling here well, wanting to switch to a worse university to live with parents closer to home, feels like will fail here.**",Examination,High,2.0,reddit:r/university,High,2,4182,790,5,Thoughts on switching to a university near where my parents live.,0

"Should I go to a fairly reputable state school or free online college. Hello, I've come across a bit of a dilemna recently and I feel torn about what I should do. As of now, I'm all set up to go to Penn State for computer science, but a big problem so far is that I didn't get anywhere close to high enough on the ALEKS exam to test in to calculus right away (I got a 39, needs to be 70). I can still retake it a few times, but if I don't get a high enough score then I won't be doing anything computer science related during my first semester, possibly even my first year. There is an alternative I've been looking into now though. I work for Walmart, and they have a program set up that would let me get an online degree from Southern New Hampshire University for free, they would pay for tuition, other fees, and even books. I got curious so I put in an application and ended up being accepted the same day, lol. I guess my question now is even if I do get the score I need on the ALEKS Exam, would it even be worth paying around $14,000 a year at Penn State when I could get a degree in the same subject for free at SNHU? I'm not concerned about the legitimacy of a degree from SNHU, they are regionally acreddited and I've seen a lot of the people who graduated say they didn't have an issue finding a job. I know that online schooling and self teaching would take a lot of self discipline, but I do feel prepared since I'm already teaching myself Web Development and I also did online school for a bit during the pandemic.

"Shotgunning isn’t great, but it’s not nearly as bad as some people are making it out to be. The main complaints about shotgunning I see are that it reduces acceptance rates and the quality of applications sent goes down, since people aren’t hyper-focusing on a few schools they really like. These complaints are valid, but they aren’t as big of a problem as they might seem in my opinion. Shotgunning does reduce acceptance rates, but I don’t think the number of competitive applications increases a significant amount. Most people don’t plan shotgunning well, so they apply to places on a whim and write essays for schools hours before their deadlines. These rushed applications probably won’t be high quality, so it’s not like people with competitive and well-thought out applications have to be concerned about them. Another thing I’d like to point out is that shotgunning isn’t nearly as common as people think it is. I go to a high school that’s ranked in the 85th percentile in my state, and most of my friends (3.8+/4.0, 1490/34+ type stats) applied to around 5-10 colleges, sometimes even less. I know like 3 people irl who applied to more than 15 like I did. People always forget that this subreddit isn’t real life. There are millions of people who apply to colleges all over the world, a few weirdos on Reddit who apply to 30+ schools won’t have a significant impact on admissions. There are definitely prestige whores out there who shotgun every single T20 without doing an ounce of research, and that’s a trend that needs to stop, but it’s not like every single shotgunner fits into this category. Some people are low-income students that need aid and get fee waivers (me). A lot of the schools that meet 100% of demonstrated need are competitive private universities and LACs, so if someone has the stats to get into one of these institutions, why wouldn’t they apply to a ton of them and hope they get into a couple of them? Some people don’t have super specific things they are looking for in a university (also me). If someone sees themselves fitting well at a LAC and a big school, then it makes sense to apply to a wide variety of schools since they know that they’ll have a good time regardless of where they go. Some people on this subreddit act like if the schools someone applies to aren’t carbon copies of each other, then that person did no research on the schools and they’re blinded by rankings, which simply isn’t true. When it comes to shotgunning reaches, as long as someone starts the applications far in advance so the applications can be high-level ones, and is aware of the fact that they might get rejected by most of the schools they applied to, I don’t think shotgunning is that much of a problem. In summary, I don’t think that shotgunning is inherently a terrible thing to do. The problem is that people who don’t plan ahead and rush essays hours before deadlines and/or place their self worth in their college decisions and have mental breakdowns after getting rejections are the ones shotgunning, which inevitably will end poorly. Shotgunning is something that only certain people should do, I know myself very well, so I decided that shotgunning was right for me. It’s not right for others, and that’s fine. I don’t think that shotgunning is the problem, I think the problem is that people aren’t honest enough with themselves to know what is best for themselves",Fees,High,2.0,web:pullpush:r/ApplyingToCollege:submission:complaint,High,2,3404,594,7,"Shotgunning isn’t great, but it’s not nearly as bad as some people are making it out to be.",0

"Professor gives unreasonable amount of homework, can anything be done. Hi everyone! I’m a college student in community college and this upcoming fall will be my last semester before I transfer. I’m a straight A student and have never struggled with a course load in class. I have even taken summer class session where the homework was hefty but extremely doable. The problem is, I am in introductory biology and it is way too much homework. I am far from a lazy student as I usually put 5 hours aside a day for homework and more if I can do so with work. Well, my biology professor laughs about how if you’re taking her class you should quit your job and other classes and give up your social life - but then proceeds to encourage exercise and meditation to help with the stressful course-load. I’m going to be extremely specific here because it’s only day two and half the class is drowning. We have two parts to the class, a biology lab and a biology lecture. Here’s our homework for tonight and I’ll explain why this is problematic. : 1. A two hour quiz that is 40 questions long based around chemistry (we are in a bio class so no idea why mathematical chemistry is necessary). 2. A chapter reading of 35 pages with small text. 3. A quiz on the chapter reading which is 5 questions long but involves heavily on digging through the small text and finding it within those pages. I must mention that her answers and definitions include no words from the text or google so you have to try to grasp what she’s even referring to and reword the entire book definition. 4. A homework assignment which is 30 questions long and involves typed paragraphs for each question. 5. Five pages of the study guide based on the 35 pages of textbook texts and her lecture. 6. 5 pages of the lab manual all color coded based on her specific standards. 7. Two online homework assignments through an online program totaling 1.5 hours length each. That’s just for tonight and our syllabus and schedule shows that this is going to be the norm for the daily homework. I work and so do a lot of people in the class and so this requirement is unrealistic for most people. Is it even ethical to assign this much homework? The main reason I complain is because I love to study. I love to make flash cards and study notes and memorize definitions and concepts. However with this homework course load there is absolutely no time to study what so ever. The homework itself is too stressful to consider it “study” time because too much of it is making it difficult to retain information. Not just for me but several students in her biology lab and class. Since she words the definitions on the online homework as if we are all in grad school, it makes it difficult to retain the information. She teaches it as if it’s a grad school biology class and not introductory. I would like time to study but I worry about passing due to all homework and no time to study. Even the study guide is constant book searching. Is there something I or my classmates can do to express how the homework amount is extremely overwhelming and leaves no time for us to actually learn and retain any of the information? Would this be something to speak about with the department chair or Dean of Student Affairs? I’ve never had a complaint about a teacher before so I’m not sure how to go about this and dropping isn’t an option for me unfortunately. Thanks for reading and I appreciate the advice. TLDR; Teacher assigns homework assignments totaling 10 hours + in a day and still maintains we must study an additional 35-50 hours on top of those 10. Students and myself are all struggling.

"What's the best course of action for core teacher recommendations if I haven't had any teacher for more than a few months. I know there's tons of resources online and on this sub about choosing who to ask for a letter of recommendation, but everything I've seen says to ask a teacher who has known me for a while, that I see and engage with outside of just class, etc. The problem is, I moved schools a ton (I've been to five high schools since freshman year, never staying more than a semester) and it wasn't until last August that things in my life finally started to stabilize. Now, I've been at my current school for the entire school year, but I've only had 3 core teachers (2 last semester and 1 this semester). None of them know me very well. My Brief Calculus teacher from last semester was really fond of me and gave me a pep talk before I took my ACT, and was happy for me when she found out I got a 35. I enjoyed her class a lot and learned a ton. But still, I have not built as much rapport with her as a lot of my classmates did. My APUSH teacher from last semester was also really nice and appreciated my work, leaving lots of really good feedback. I participated a lot in her class, but again, did not build the same rapport with her as my classmates did. I will have her sometime next year, but I don't know if it'll be first or second semester. Finally, my Pre-Calc teacher this year has noticed me for my academics more than anything, and even though I've missed like 6 weeks of her class throughout the semester (competitive robotics means lots of travel) I'm still the top of her class and always turn work in on time and communicate as early as I can about me missing days. I will have her both semesters next year. Again, though, she doesn't know me as well as other students. Being at a small school, most of my peers have known these teachers since freshman year, so that's why they tend to have stronger rapport with them. I also was, admittedly, not super social last semester because I wasn't sure if I was actually staying at this high school. Now, I'm trying to decide who to ask for a rec. I know no one here can tell me for sure what I should do, but does anyone have any tips on how I can decide?

"I don’t know if it’s specifically a CC thing, but in our case, it’s more of a collective bargaining thing.

Like in the grand scheme of things a 1400 is NOT low every single person knows that, don’t insult their intelligence by pointing it out. Moreover, I’m almost positive that it’s not a humble brag. 1400 IS low when compared to the fact that people 1500+ usually get into ivies. That’s just one specific instance I’ve seen a bunch but there are honestly a ton more where people will express disappointment about a score in the 1300s and people will be ON THEM in the comments about how they should be grateful. Like bro let them feel what they need to, obviously they were shooting for a goal and didn’t achieve it so why would you accuse them of not being grateful or ‘bragging’ like chill.we all know how competitive college applications have gotten and they wanted a higher score so why don’t YOU respect that and leave your shitty shaming comment behind.

If it were during the day I think I'd let it go but it always starts at like 9 pm and goes till like 1 am. Two days ago I finally snapped and submitted a noise complaint to the on duty RA and she went and talked to them. It stopped that night, but the next night they were at it AGAIN. So I another noise complaint and another RA talks to them. Tonight the music is back and loud as ever. I hate to be that guy who complains three nights in a row but this is absurd!

"Seeking advice re: salary. UK-experienced advice would be particularly helpful, but I’ll take whatever you’ve got. I (30, F) am just starting the second year of my two year postdoc in the UK. I earn £36k pa, which is the lowest increment of my salary grade. I was awarded my PhD 3 years ago, and worked in an academia-adjacent charity role for just over a year. During that time, I also held an honorary postdoc position, and continued to publish. Someone in my current lab (Late 20s, M) earns exactly the same as me. He was hired about 9 months ago as a PhD student due to complete shortly. He still hasn’t finished writing, let alone arranged his viva. He is a massive dick to me on a regular basis because he thinks it’s hysterical that we earn the same, and therefore he’s doing so much better than I was at his stage. Is it reasonable for me to bring this up to my supervisor at my annual review next week? I don’t want to whine about someone else’s salary, but it does seem unfair that my 3 years postdoc experience is valued the same as someone who is still a student. As for working out solutions myself: I wrongly assumed I’d automatically get an incremental increase annually, but apparently I was supposed to apply for an increment increase (I would have been rejected anyway because the deadline was a month before I would’ve been in post for a year). I have been looking at other jobs, but my current supervisor is quite literally the leading expert in the disease I study. Her lab brings in millions in grant funding and I’ve been warned by more senior colleagues in other universities that I’m in the most secure academic job I could hope for. The golden ticket. I don’t want to jeopardise that, but I also don’t want to hold a grudge and feel undervalued.

"Not taking any honors or APs junior year. Am I done for.

To me, looking at our class registration for higher classes I qualify for is torture to me, as honors/AP class has atleast three different requirements that have to be met. Unless you have A's across the board, which I do (except for A C- in geometry and a B- in my shop/major).** I personally believe this is stupid, as I've believe I can excel at higher classes that I do enjoy like Physics and World History, while keeping classes I don't exactly enjoy like English at a regular level.

"Is my motivation for finishing college healthy. So I’m currently in college and it’s very obvious I haven’t been caring about it. I started two years ago but only at 8 credits, I’m very behind but starting out strong next Monday. Taking faster classes than usual due to potentially loosing financial aid because I failed a lot, and my gpa is very low so I’m trying to get back up there. I don’t work at job and fully supported by my parents even with student aid. I considered dropping out but I feel so guilty because I have been doing nothing these past years, I’m at home everyday just slacking and feeling bad for myself making excuses. When I started I didn’t know what I wanted to do, and got caught up with just living life instead of focusing on my priorities. That wasn’t smart at all, but my views are different now. I don’t want to be at home with my parents for the rest of my life, so I need this degree. I want to move out and be able to date who I want/go where I want and not even be financially dependent on my parents because I think it’s doing more harm than good. I am grateful, but need to grow up. Not to mention my mom always is on me about this college stuff, because a degree is very very “important” in life(she got hers late but enjoyed her 20s). I truly just want to be done for my parents and for myself. Is it bad I want to finish college and will tell myself when I get stressed with assignments to just picture a life finally living for myself with a decent job? Is that good motivation?

What should I do. I am currently committed to Umich to study computer science in the college of engineering. Today I got off the waitlist at UNC chapel hill. I need to decide where to go by next week. Obviously the better school is Umich but it costs 85k a year compared to 65k a year at UNC. Additionally the weather at mich is sooo much worse. I am really unsure of what to do. I already have a roomate and have gotten really excited to go to mich but idk if the cost is worth it. UNC is still a great school and I would be saving 80k in total which is a lot and I still think I would like it there as from my view the vibes are similar to mich. My concerns are that I have yet to get into the computer science major at UNC because you have to apply after your first year but I've heard acceptance rate is 75% and I got in at mich so I dont think there should be an issue. Also there are no engineering majors at UNC and I was debating whether to switch to engineering but I am unsure whether I even will.

"Advisor signed me up for classes without my knowledge or permission. I'm hear to ask for advice. I receive financial aid to attend college, i cannot pay for classes and books without it, so from the very beginning of me going to college i have always explicitly stated to not sign me up for classes, to let me do that manually. This went well for 3 years. I had a miscommunication with an advisor of a program i was in, i was asking if i only had access to online classes, and if i wouldn't be able to sign up for in person classes if that was the case (when signing up for the program you choose what kind you are, in person, half, or online). I asked because i wasn't certain if the lack of in-person classes was that i do not have access or they are removed from the list when they are full. They replied with an affirmative, that classes where full and asked if i wished to be changed to a full time campus student, i said yes. They said they would have me transferred to a new advisor and then i should be good to go. I never check whether i was signed up for classes because 1) to me, no where in there did it say they where signing me up for classes. 2) i wasn't going to sign up for that semester because of medical issues. Couple months later i find out i was signed up for 8 classes and its months into the semester, i now owe the school a bunch of money in tuition, as well as financial aid (they automatically help pay for classes when you sign up for them). I promptly withdrew from classes and started asking my advisor what happened. They explained that they did what i wanted them to, sign me up for classes, and that the best i could do was appeal for a refund. My Appeal was denied. They never used the words classes, they never explained that they where signing me up for campus classes, they do not know my schedule and when i would have actually been available and able to go to classes, and financial aid can only comfortably cover 4-5 classes at most for me (especially considering all the equipment i would have needed to buy). financial aid only covered half of the classes they even signed me up for. They never asked me anything, or confirmed with me that they where doing this, they just signed me up for 8 classes. The other problem with this is that financial aid only covers a set amount of semesters, so even if i did know i was signed up for classes, and looked through them, if i wouldn't be able to attend 4 or 5 classes than i wouldn't attend that semester at all as it would just be a wasted semester. I just want to know what i can do, because with how this is going, i wont be able to go to college, I'll need to completely stop and start working to pay everything off, and i dont know if or when id be able to get back to college.

"College Guide: How to Survive College. Prior to starting, would anyone watch if I made a podcast/video about this post rather than pure text? Lmk what you think! Thanks. Hey y’all! Hope everyone is doing well! As I continue into my first year of graduate school, I have been thinking back to my undergraduate years and how lost/confused I was when navigating schools. So, with my past four years, I am going to put my tips and tricks to surviving college! This will be split into three sections: Dormitory/Housing, Academics, and finances. You can feel free to add in, agree, or disagree! This has been my experience, but I know there are many out there with different experiences. Enjoy! Prior to starting, I feel the need to add this in. Community college is something that is debated a lot, and if I were to go back five years ago (putting athletics aside and purely financial), I would have absolutely taken the route to community college. Financially, it is the smartest option (in my opinion); for those who are able to, staying up at home and saving money off of rent/housing/meal plans is absolutely amazing. Yes, there might be limitations in the classes at community colleges, but the fact that you are getting a degree AT ALL is amazing! There is no shame in community college, and it really is an amazing avenue for anyone looking to get a degree. Of course, there are limitations in regard to the types of classes and degrees offered, but community colleges, as a whole, are financially highly recommended and once you get your degree, you can choose to transfer to a larger college if you wish. Ahem, anyways. Let’s get on to it! **MAJOR DISCLAIMER: This post is too long, so part 2 will be in the comments (or an entirely different post depending on length)** **Disclaimer: There will be a few cusses in here, but they will be censored. It is all lighthearted!** **Disclaimer Two: All links to products will be at the bottom of this entire thing. I am not sponsored by anything, so please no company sue me or that’d really suck.** Dormitory/Housing: Ah, so you finally made it to college! No more mom, no more siblings, no more curfew, just you and the REAL world! You’re a little nervous, but that’s alright! Everyone else is as scared/nervous as you are! You go through orientation (God that took so many hours, right!), and everything sounds absolutely amazing. Plus, you got a bunch of free t-shirts, bags, and cups. However, as you make your way to your empty dorm, you can’t help feeling doubt clouding your mind. Totally cool. Let’s go through a couple questions and recommendations that I have for a wide variety of people! **1.** You are super excited to get into your room and start decorating! You have been waiting for this since you were fourteen (or even younger). The world is your oyster, you have Pinterest boards, written writeups, and you and your roommate are ready to take on the world. Well, except you realize that buying these decorations is really f-ing expensive. You got to target, and oh my goodness a single plush throw is THIRTY-FIVE FLIPPING DOLLARS. You have five hundred dollars in your back account and a dream (if even that)! Everyone is always saying how Target is so affordable, but for me, I have found it to be the biggest scam. They charge you a lot for what is supposed to be actually affordable. However, don’t you worry, I got some tricks for you! Okay OP, so where am I supposed to go? Target? Walmart? The thrift store? Well, believe it or not, you can shop at Target and Walmart, and I have a few links to where you can find affordable items for those stores with different items. But I have a few better spots that are more financially friendly for college students. The first spot(s) are TJ Maxx and HomeGoods. I know I know; you can walk into one of these places and leave with 400$ worth of stuff in a blink. However, when it comes to getting small things such as: bedding, blankets, rugs, and tubber ware, I find these sister stores to be a god send. I have gotten nearly all my towels from HomeGoods. Good towels can go for 10$ which can be pricey, but there is a deal at HomeGoods (or sometimes Tj Maxx) where they have a set of towels (Rachel Zoe, Tahari, Ecotery, etc.) that include: two bath towels, two wash clothes, and two hand towels for 24.99$. Y’all, you don’t need forty-seven towels, I have five bath towels I rotate and three towel turbans that I use for my hair. You can reuse your towels (cleaning them of course). The reason I say to go to Tj Maxx of HomeGoods is because a Rachel Zoe towel set can run you 50 + dollars easily. Of course, if you don’t want a towel set, you can get individual towels from 6.99-12.99. But, as I say, that is a pretty penny. I suggest these sets, however, there are other stores that offer similar options! Those include target, Walmart, bed bath and beyond, and Khol’s (just to name a few!). I have a few options at the bottom of this entire thing! The only downside for TJ Maxx and HomeGoods is their website is pretty bad, so I would recommend going in person. Okay, so towels! Damn you can go on a long time about towels. What about bedding? Rugs? And all that other jazz? HomeGoods is my go-to for bedding, entirely so. You can get good sheets sets for 19.99 and blankets for 14.99 and on. I prefer to not use a comforter and just drown in over the size throws. In addition to HomeGoods, you can also try Ross, where I found a bunch of similar things for the same prices so and so. Links will be listed below for sheets and blankets. Important note! You, yes you. I am talking to you. Some folks don’t know this, but it is recommended to clean your bedding every two weeks. It can be a hassle, especially if you want to do nothing but sleep, but if you want to feel clean in the morning and after a shower: clean your bed sheets and blankets. I do so every two weeks, and some folks might scream, but I put my sheets in the washer and dryer and just run it either hot or warm water. For blankets, I tend to do a warm setting, and I always always always do heavy load setting. Get that filth out. You and your roommate will thank you for cleaning your bed sheets. **Tip 1**: I recommend having two to three sets of bed sheets; yes, you heard me right. I have two “good” sets of bed sheets that I switch on and off while cleaning the others. I then have one kind of mid set of bed sheets that I use for “if only I am too lazy to clean the others one”. It makes life a helluva lot easier if you don’t feel like washing your bed sheets, so you can just pop the new ones on and put the other ones to be washed later on. **Tip 2**: Because this doesn’t fit with the above, I recommend using queen or even king-sized bed sheets (I use queen). The reason being that there is nothing I hate more than waking up with my bed sheets coming off of my mattress and sleeping on an icky mattress pad or mattress. Having queen or king sets, you don’t have to worry about that as much. The second spots I like for decorating purposes are: five below, dollar tree, dollar general, and Target/Walmart 1,3, and 5$ shops. Now now, I know what y’all are thinking: didn’t OP just bash target and Walmart? Yes, I absolutely did. Just hear me out. I know, like me, y’all likely want some rad lights, calendars, clocks, etc. But then you go to a normal place and a set of string lights are 15-30$. Like, my brother in love, what? My favorite spot to go for cool nick knacks is 5 below. You can find a bunch of room decorations in that store, from lights, calendars, clocks, random decorations, etc. Listen, if it’s for decoration, it doesn’t need to be super expensive. Additionally, dollar tree and dollar general are also adequate for said decorations. I just found five below and Tj Maxx/HomeGoods to be the easiest for decorations. Okay, now you’re probably like: OP what about the whole Target Walmart thing? Well, you see, this is my one tidbit about these two dudes. There is a section y’all see with these two which are the 5$ and below section. These are tailored specifically for college students (and those of us who definitely are not responsible with money), and you can find a lot of neat (small) decorations for cheap! Just be careful how much you add to cart cause that can get expensive. The third spots I like for general laundry detergent, lights, batteries, soaps, etc. are discount stores. Not sure exactly what’s around y’all but where I am we have an Ollie’s bargain store. It is a little bit overwhelming, but with a few deep breaths, you can find main brand laundry detergent, dryer sheets, soaps, cleaning supplies, etc. It will be expensive anywhere to get these cleaning and basic supplies, but I find that bargain stores are your best bet for trying to save any money at all. **2.** Now you’re probably thinking: holy f\*ck OP we get it, you like shopping and have probably spent an ungodly amount of money on blankets. Yes, you’re absolutely right. I have. And do I regret it? No. Does my bank account regret it? Yes. So, let’s get along with dorm life recommendations. Okay, OP, I have read this far: what should I know about laundry? Well, my friend, I am glad you have asked. You see, your school has likely done the thing where they stuff a bunch of people in one dorm and have given them 2 washers and dryers for 100+ people. And suddenly, it’s Sunday afternoon and you realize you have no clean clothes, and when you try to go to the laundry room, there are people hogging the washers and driers. Oh, and you go to grab your laundry from the drier (literally a minute after it ends) and you catch someone taking your stuff out and putting theirs in. Like, yeahhhhh, no. My recommendation for this conundrum is a bit unusual. Some might like it, some might not. So, when my weekends come around, I know lots of folks will have gone home, out partying, watching football, etc. For boring people like me, I do some of that stuff. However, in the late evenings (and I mean 12 – 4am) I like to do my laundry. No one is here or awake, and no one is certainly worrying about laundry when they can be getting wasted at a bar somewhere. Guess when I wrote this entire thing? Yep, 2:30am doing my laundry. You don’t have to worry about folks stealing your laundry, you don’t have to worry about having enough washers and driers. The downside to this method? You have to be a night owl. You have to be willing to suck it up and be up at the ungodly hours. If you’re like me, you’ll probably be doing a research project, scrolling through reddit, or watching football (I don’t have much of a social life let’s be for real). So, I get the apprehension. If you want a more reasonable time, then you can likely do it earlier in the morning (8am – 10am) when folks are getting ready for lectures. There’s a better chance you can get washers and driers. If you have a day where you have nothing to do, then I recommend the night before getting your washing and cleaning done, that way you can crash without consequences when you are done. Thanks for the tips OP, but how do I even wash my laundry? So, I am not the best person to ask for this. Personally, what I found has worked for me, is putting all my colors together and then all my whites together (I do not promote racism; I am talking about clothes, people). I always wash on hot, heavy load, and normal settings. I want my clothes cleaned, y’all. I don’t care what the labels say (unless what I am washing is expensive). Additionally, I always dry my clothes hot or warm (depending on the material). If it’s expensive, it’s probably air dry or no heat, I would recommend doing that varying on directions. Okay, but what about even loading the washer and drier? A common question for those of us who haven’t really done laundry before. You know what’s embarrassing? When you overload the washer and suddenly there is water all over the floor and a washer out of commission for an entire dorm. Then suddenly you get an email to everyone from your RA telling them to NOT OVERFILL THE WASHERS. Couldn’t be me (shivers). So, what do we take from this? It is going to be annoying, but you cannot fill the washer to the rim. Firstly, your sh\*t won’t get cleaned, and secondly there’s a good chance you will overflow the washer. I fill the washers just over halfway and run my cycle. Then there is washing detergent and all that fancy stuff. Before even loading my laundry, I put one pod in of laundry detergent and then a whole cup of the smelling stuff (idk what it is called). If you are an athlete, I recommend doing two cups of laundry smelling scent stuff. Also, if you are an athlete, you need to wash your clothes regularly. I know I should not be the one telling you this, but it is better that I tell you this than your roommate or RA. **3.** Okay, OP thanks for the lecture about laundry (you probably). But what about my roommate? What if I am anti-social as f\*ck? Well, to be honest, if you’re on reddit, then you got your answer. No, I am just f\*cking with you. College is a scary place, especially if you’re introverted. Your parents, like mine, probably have said “this is your place to reinvent yourself”, thanks mom and dad. And while you probably think your parents are trying to just have your back, they are actually right. This is something I haven’t done particularly well since going to my new graduate school. It is scary, man. Especially coming in with completely different people, and (if like me) from a completely different part of the country. Okay, so what do I do? For me, I play on a sports team. I have found that consistently interacting with these people has given me a social outlet, and we all bond together over something we are passionate about. You are going to have a bunch of different people in one place focusing on the same goal. Yet, it does not just have to be a sport. It can be a club, it can be a football fantasy league, it can be a meet up with a group of people for a club named “socializing 101”. Listen, college is scary. You need to meet your groups of people; that is something I am still learning myself. You don’t need to get stupid drunk to meet folks, you don’t have to change yourself. Finding people in your classes is crucial, try to make study groups. Sometimes, you have to just approach a person and ask them if you can have lunch, talk about school, or something. It’s scary as hell, but that is one way I made genuine friends. What if I am unsure about my roommate? Oh buddy, let me tell you, I have horror stories about roommates. You have heard stories about roommates. Your 3^(rd) great uncle Joe has horror stories about roommates. We ALL do. Realistically, when going to college and knowing no one, it is super difficult to find a roommate randomly that you f\*ck with. What I highly recommend is taking that charting thing FR. Talk to these folks, get to know them. And if you get there and y’all hit it off like two peas in a pod? Hell yeah. However, if you get there and you KNOW it ain’t gonna last longer than Aaron Rodger’s Achilles last season, then what I recommend is talking with your roommate about possible issues that they have and how you can sort them out. If that don’t work, talk to your RA. They don’t get paid enough to deal with that, but they will try their best to sort it out. They’re human, so please be nice to them. And if that does not work, approach the housing resource station (or whatever it is called) and ask them to switch. Explain the situation to them, that you have talked with the RA, and that it is just not going to work. There’s a good chance you will ruin someone’s year with that e-mail that the open spot in their dorm room has been taken over, but there is a 90% chance it will be better than before. And, if you’re lucky, they might have room for a double that is unoccupied. If all else fails and you know you will be miserable with anyone, then I would recommend doing the scary thing and looking into a single. It will be more expensive, that is factual. But, if you’re like me and genuinely cannot have a roommate due to medical issues, then looking into a single is important. It might be worth more, but it also comes with peace of mind. If you know that you will struggle having a roommate no matter who you live with that is a sign that this might be the right path for you. **Tip 1**: If you have a disability that can be supported by doctor note/diagnosis, reach out to the ADA department at your school and there is a chance they can put you in ADA housing. This is almost always a single for those who have a disability. It can be a struggle to go through, but it is one of the ways that those with disabilities can get the housing appropriate for them. \*\*Tip 2\*\*: Do not miss out on room selection. It may be at 6am in the morning on a random Tuesday, but if you miss out on signing up for a good dorm or put on the lottery, you will hate yourself. Have a plan. You need to have a plan; someone you want to have a room with (or a plan for a single you want) and be ready to go to war. Folks will be refreshing wanting that one golden dorm. If you are even an hour late (overexaggerating for some colleges), then you are getting the worst dormitory in the school (the one where the only two toilets on the floor are always clogged or out of order and the community kitchen is always gross and being used). So be prepared. \*\*4\*\*. Okay, so: buying stuff, laundry, and roommates, that’s great and all, but here are a few miscellaneous things that don’t really fit with the rest. First thing first, I’m gonna lecture you on bedtimes, routines, and all that. If your parents haven’t done it, I am going to. Unlike me (it is currently just past 3am now), you need to have steady bedtime. It is not elementary school, but you need to have a bedtime you try to stick to. For me, I have work in the mornings, so I am typically going to bed around 12am and waking up at 7am. Except you, my child, needs to be sleeping 7 to 9 hours a day. Sleep is crucial to learning, surviving, and all that jazz. Don’t trust me? Take it from Cornell, UNC, even the freaking CDC. You can probably survive at 4, 5, or 6 hours. But do I recommend it? No. Not only will your learning retention be shortened, but you will feel like shit. It does not matter how much coffee you get or how many sodas you down, you need your damn sleep. OP I need to study though? And I have sports? Like, what do you expect of me? I get it, as a STEM major and college athlete, getting sleep is ridiculously difficult. What you need to do is have a plan. You need to plan out your assignments, you need to stick to a studying schedule, and you need to stick to a routine. It is so easy to get carried away at 2am watching videos on how to build a fortress out of toothpicks. We have all been there. But then you have to be to practice at 6am and suddenly you can’t fall asleep for the life of you. Then it is 330am and you get a little bit of sleep and then BEEP BEEP BEEP, your five something am alarm is going off. At that point, was it even worth getting sleep? So, in short, you have to work in a routine. Find one you can work with, whether it is going to bed at 9pm or 1am. Yes, I said 1am. If you can at least be steady and work in a system that you are used to, then you can learn to deal with the schedule presented to you. So now you’re probably thinking about the lecture I just gave you. What about down time? Like, seriously OP, when am I supposed to even have time to myself? That’s the thing, college is supposed to be amazing, and you have all this down time. And you tell yourself “I just survived high school that went on for 8+ hours a day this is nothing,” but if you tell yourself that then you are falling into a trap. Listen, we all survived high school (or some sort of prior education), and it is unbelievably easy to think that with so much time on your hands, you can do anything you want. And I mean anything. Your studies are important; some people put all their time into their academics and all the power to them. Some of them are athletes, and they find themselves struggling to balance academics and athletics, which is also valid. And some of us have managed to figure it all out by managing to keep it up for 32 hours a day and have no problem. No seriously, we all know a person like that. In reality, despite college appearing to be an open door to free time, you really need to be careful. Go to your damn classes, eat properly, attend social meetings, study, and then set aside 1 – 3 hours to yourself. This can be in the evening; this can be spread out over the day. Just take some time, listen to music, work out, walk, nap, do something to help clear your mind out. If you don’t, then you are going to go crazy. I would know it, believe me, I have been there and done that. \*\*Lastly\*\*: relationships. Okay, we are ready, what do we really know about love? If you read this, you’re kidding yourself, we are on reddit y'all. No, I am playing (cries in forever alone). So, you have arrived at college, you’re going to class and see the prettiest or most handsome guy, gal, or pal you’ve ever seen. You are flabbergasted wondering how such an attractive person is in front of you. And, like a dream, they approach you, y’all strike up a conversation, and two months later you are engaged. Listen, I am all for relationships, find your person. However, do not rush into marriage, especially as a freshman. You’re still learning people; you're still learning who you are. The girl you’re seeing? That’s actually the football captain’s sister, and he is an angry linebacker while you’re a 5’9 tight-end. AKA, unless you get to know her, make sure you don’t rush into anything. Of course you don’t need me, a redditor, to lecture you. You are your own person. But I just really want you to consider not rushing into anything without knowing the person. I am not saying to not get into a relationship, just make sure you like the person for who they are and not for the thrill of being in a relationship. \*\*Academics\*\*: Well well well, you’ve managed to get past housing/dorms. You have your courses set up, class times ready, and a dream to get that 4.0. Woo! Exciting! Here’s how you can get those good grades. I, personally, was a 3.3 student in my undergraduate (B- to A student). So, take my advice with a grain of salt. The general things that will be covered here are: realism, coursework, and so on. \*\*1\*\*. I want that 4.0! How do I do it? Well, hello there! You’re here and you’re in class. You get to your class fifteen minutes early, seeing the rest of the fresh faces who are also attending that class. You enter into the lecture room, take a seat close to the professor but not front row so you don’t get picked on. You do this four or five more times and after the end of the first week you think that you got the hang of it. Well that, my friends, is called the syllabus week. You either have three types of classes: Monday, Wednesday, Friday (each 50 min), Tuesday and Thursday (hour and fifteen minutes), or one day a week for three hours. I personally don’t mind any of these besides the three hour one. Why is that, you may ask. It’s only once a week! How hard can that be? And you will ask yourself that when you are an hour and a half in with a lecture talking about different types of cell mechanics in sunflower seeds which you have no interest in because you’re an English major. So let me be realistic with y’all for a second, you can absolutely get a 4.0. Folks who do put a whole lot of heart and soul into what they do. For me? Once you get to upper-level courses (STEM major), suddenly those easy courses get real hard. You could get a 40 on an examination and be ecstatic because the second highest grade was a 22. It doesn’t matter how hard you study, at times, there are professors that will screw you over. This leads me to my very first tip (one you have likely heard before) which is: rate my professor. You’ve heard, your mom has heard it, and remember your 3^(rd) great uncle joe? Yeah, he’s heard of it too. And this website is not just there to show you pretty numbers, when you are scheduling your classes, go to the f\*ing websites and look at your professors. If they have a 1 star rating with 45 reviews, try to avoid that professor. Think of it was a food service. Do you really want to go to a professor with a 2 star rating with the average commentator saying that the professor puts questions on the test the range from who wrote Romeo and Julliet to how to do chi squared? Yeah, me neither. This leads in my next point and, if you are here, possible the most important thing I am going to say in this entire thread: \*\*MEETING WITH YOUR ADVICE EARLY AND REGISTER AS SOON AS CLASSES COME OUT.\*\* My god, I can not scream this into the void enough. For me, I went to a smaller school, so I guess it would be easier to get advising appointments in. However, y’all, especially with classes that are lower level (which multiple folks in different majors have to take), you need to be early with registration. Your advisor will you give you suggestions on classes and give you a schedule which is adequate for your time. It is your responsibility to make sure you have that lined up, with professors you like, and are ready to register (accept the class schedule) the minute it becomes available. I am telling you right now, every single person who can register early will register early. It is going to be another 7am it opens sort of thing (like with dorms), and if you are not there quick enough, you are going to be stuck with the Mr. Smith who is an ex-police officer “resigned” from duty for doing illegal activities and the only way he can get credit time served (a job) is to work at the college teaching you children about literature from the 1800s (he doesn’t even have a degree). I mean this whole heartedly when I say do your f\*cking researching. Your life will be so much easier if you put the effort in and ensure that you are ready to enroll as soon as it becomes available. If you don’t, you will hate yourself. Remember, rate my professor is like yelp for professors. Do you want a professor that I will go out of their way when a class doesn’t perform well on the test to go over questions for extra credit if everyone participates? Or do you want Mr.Smith who is teaching or else his ex-wife will sue him due to a few too many restraining order violations? \*\*2\*\*. OP how do I even contact my professor? What if I am not doing well in class but they do not have office hours when I need it? My friend, let me tell you a quick story. It was my freshman year, and I was taking anatomy and physiology one. I was doing alright except for the practical(s). By alright I mean I was scraping with a 71 and a dream. I realized that if I dropped to a 70, I would fail that class. It’s my last module in that class and there is a good shot I don’t pass. So, what did I do? Did I A. ignore my problems and focus on studying for the next two weeks straight B. beg my professor for extra credit C. cheat on my examination with answers given from Mary Jane for 100$ in exchange or D. go to the professor and ask what to do? If you answered D, you would be correct. And you know what that professor did? He 1. helped me with some of the content I was not understanding and 2. recommended I go to the tutoring center. I, someone who had a 3.8 out of high school, suddenly was looking into. tutoring. What blasphemy was this! Except, it was not blasphemy. In fact, tutoring saved my grade not just in A&amp;P 1, but it allowed me to understand the rest of the classes I was struggling with. For most of my undergraduate, I would schedule lessons with the tutoring center (twice a week per class I was struggling with), and we would go over details on what I had issues with, how to go about them differently, and why they were answered the way they were. My teacher explained to me like this: going to a tutor who has taken the class with that professor before is like getting a cheat sheet for the exam. The tutors have to have maintained at least a 90 in that class within the past three years. All the tutors I went to had notes from those classes, past examination questions, and they could answer questions I had on homework. They didn’t have past examination copies, necessarily, but they were able to answer questions I had that regarded to possible test questions. You guys don’t know how helpful it is to ask a tutor what possible questions will be on the exam, and they explain it to you and then, look at it, those exact questions (with varying amounts) are on the exam! Thanks for the lecture, OP! But what if I can’t find a tutor in the subject I have? What if my class is upper level or there are no tutors that have the time availability for me? The thing I figured out as I was finishing my bachelor's degree is that you NEED to contact your teachers. Some may of office hours, but there is often the idea that if you can’t reach them during office hours, they won’t be able to get to you at all. Sometimes you might be able to make office hours; yet, if you can’t, you just have to reach out to your professor. Talk to them after class, make an email thread, do whatever you can to establish that you have questions and need help. Ask them if you can come in sometime other than office hours. I promise you that they will say yes, especially with upper-level professors. They are there to help you, and you have to be willing to reach out for that help. One class that I established a tutoring schedule with was with my Spanish professor. I started it in Spanish 2, and when I got to Spanish 4 I was doing relatively okay. However, despite my attempts to learn Spanish, I was still greatly at a disadvantage compared to my classmates. Why? I don’t know, I just sucked at Spanish. So, I reached out to this professor, and we made a tutoring schedule 2 –3 times a week for fifty minutes. We would go over the contents that I was struggling with and then the contents of the next lecture. This gave me a heads up on what we would be talking about that next day so I wouldn’t feel so nervous. We did our lectures entirely in Spanish, and let me tell you, I couldn’t understand a peep of what he said. But, with having the tutoring sessions in English (AND ACTUALLY COMMMUNICATING WITH MY PROFESSOR) I managed to get my first B in Spanish. This is one example. I have also had tutoring in parasitology (amazing professor but difficult class), genetics, A&amp;P 2, and so on. Even now, in my graduate program, I have established connections with professors to ensure that I am doing the best I can to understand the materials. My classes are asynchronous, but I still reach out to my professors when I don’t understand something. We sit down and meet to discuss questions I have. And if you can’t find a time that works, talk to them. Leave an e-mail chain. SOMETHING IS BETTER THAN NOTHING. It is best to do ANYTHING than struggle in silence. Professors do not what to see you fail, it’s their job to ensure that you are able to do the best you can. If there is one thing you take away from this post it is this: get tutoring if you don’t understand something, reach out to your professors directly. It is different in big schools, I get that. But the same thing applies to TAs and other tutoring centers, there are sources there to help you, you just have to admit that you need help. \*\*Note\*\*: Y’all have heard the term “Cs get degrees”, and darling, guess what, that is true. Listen people associate with Cs by scraping by, and once you get to genetics and geriatric care, yeah, you’re gonna be a bit nervous and confused. Some folks are great at courses like that, some people study real hard and get those good grades. For folks like me who are average (maybe even a bit dumb) but try hard to get an average grade, good on you. Sometimes we have to realize that just because you got a C does not mean you are any lesser than someone who got higher. Y’all are both important and both passed. Some folks are super smart and work incredibly hard to get those grades, all the power to you guys. Me? Well, I worked incredibly hard and scraped by. It’s okay to not have the highest grade, as long as you are doing what you absolutely can, then all the power to you. \*\*3\*\*. You wake up at 7am on Wednesday and look at your alarm clock knowing you have to be at lecture from 8 to 10. You dread it, and you can’t help but ponder why you waited to the last second to register and ended up with an 8am five days a week. You decide to skip the class; what’s the worst that happens? Well, some people can afford class. Some professors don’t take attendance. Yet, as you move up class levels and the class sizes get smaller, professors will start taking attendance. You can skip a certain number of classes before failing. Listen, you have your own willpower! It is your choice! Skip those classes! No, please don’t. I am completely serious when I say you need to attend your classes. You miss one class and suddenly you are completely lost. It’s one class, then two, then four, etc. It can fall apart so quickly. I am not saying you can’t skip one or two classes (hell, I have done the same). However, once you realize you are missing too many classes and your grades start to slip, when does it stop? You have to realize that missing classes will lead to consequences. This can be getting worst grades or even being dropped from the class. It is not worth it y’all. This is not something I will settle on; you need to attend your classes. You will regret it, I promise you. \*\*4\*\*. You’ve seen this little website going around, it is said to make college life much easier. Just a little enter into the search bar and suddenly you have a whole essay or research product in seconds! You submit, surely thinking that it is better than anything you have ever written. You get it back and huh! A zero! What is this mayhem! You just failed the class, and now you can never show your face to that professor ever again. You know what I am talking about folks: chat GPT. Well not just chat GPT but other AI sources as well. Listen, AI can be an absolutely amazing source. But it is not an amazing source for writing essays and projects. I know it can be so tempting to just open that website and click that little button, all your worries \*poof\* gone. Suddenly there is the AI checker, no problem, you’ll try a different website that totally gets by the checker. Hahaha, no. You see, unlike the AI checker, your professor actually reads your essay. The AI checker might not detect AI, but your professor sure as hell will be able to smell the bull sh\*t meter a mile away. Don’t believe me? I have seen students get dropped from classes for during in an AI generated project or essay. Your professors will not be pleased about this, I promise you. It showcases that 1. you don’t value their time and 2. that you don’t know the material (or can’t present that you do). This is not just chat GPT, as stated, there are other websites that offer these services in return for easy essays or projects. Guys, listen, just do your work. No magic AI center can convey understanding like a person. AI genuinely scares me. I know a lot of folks think AI is great, but I believe that there are limits to how good something can be. Once people start using AI to try and make it look like they understand concepts (that they don’t), then suddenly there are grades administered to people who don’t really understand topics. And while you can say “yay, I passed that class because of AI”, you realize that a lot of concepts build off of concepts that you used AI to look up. And, suddenly, AI really does not do a lot for you. I am not saying all AI is bad, in fact, there are two AI features I use in all my projects. That being scribbr and mybib. You see, one thing you will learn to do (a lot) is cite. You cite sources for EVERYTHING! And you know what I don’t want to do when I have been staring at a paper for the last eight hours and am all finished to realize that my sources are not cited yet? I do not want to f\*ing cite fifteen sources manually. So, you know what I do? I pop my sources into scribbr or mybib and their AI will find the sites and cite it for you. It is not doing the project for you; it simply cites the site/source provided and gives you an accurate citation. I use these two for anything I needed citing for (MLA, APA, Vancouver, etc.), and it is the only AI I am really thankful for within my academic journey. Mybib and scribbr links will be at the bottom of this document for your availability. They require no sign up or fee. \*\*Note\*\*: Citation machine is also a good source! I find it to be a little more of a hassle with the ADs and sometimes not being able to get all the information when it is literally right there. However, it can still be a good way to cite if needed. \*\*Note 2\*\*: You know what is important? Communication. Listen, we are talking about everything; communication is crucial for everything in your life. It starts with college, where it is your turn to take charge of your life. You are given freedom, but you also have to realize that you have responsibilities that come with those freedoms. There is no better time to start working in communication than college. It can be with professors, friends, team mates, room mates, and so on. One thing I have learnt in college is how to speak up for myself. I used to be quiet and very nervous to advocate for my well being. However, once you get to higher education, you realize that your parents, siblings, or Uncle Joe are going to advocate for you. They might for the first few months, but this is the part of your life where you realize your parents can’t be the ones speaking for you. The example I use is making phone calls. Something that is so easy yet so daunting. I remember in 9^(th) grade I had to miss a sports practice, and I had to call my captain but had a full-blown mental breakdown and started sobbing. I then called her (when practice was already over) telling them I would not be able to make it to practice. Yeah, not my finest moment. But now? Yeah, I get nervous to make phone calls. But if you don’t learn how to initiate communication, then it will haunt you for the rest of your life. Only YOU can stop forest fires – no wait, only YOU can initiate communication in order to make your life easier. I am not saying that your parents are to stop from helping in everything. Last month I called my mom because I couldn’t get my sickle cell documentation, and I was so fed up with EVERYTHING. I had spent 200$ on a test/labs when I knew I did not need them. I had waited in an care for two and a half hours, searched through every documentation and email I had, and I STILL could not find the documentation. Calling my mom as a last resort, it took her fifteen minutes to get the documentation from an old pediatrician. It’s okay to have parents help you out, but you have to realize that you need to be the one to initiate communication (most times).

"Zero, report, ignore. I know there's a ton of ""what to do about AI"" questions but I'd like to ask about my own experience with it. I teach a sophomore level biology lab at the university and the assignment is to complete a scientific experiment and report and get a feel for what it's like to write science literature, with supported resources from primary articles. The entire point of the assignment being that you can't just bullshit around in science, you have to be able to support yourself with facts. I have given ALL the writing resources you could conjure, had an entire 3-hour lab dedicated just to writing, guided them through finding primary literature resources and even had them submit them just to ensure they were on the right track. I've given feedback on everything submitted, helped them through the statistics and even went as far as running their data to give them the p values needed. They've been given SO much, and as an instructor I do enjoy being helpful after letting them figure it out for some time independently. After all this is COLLEGE. That I KNOW of, I have 3 students who submitted FLAWLESS, and I mean vocabulary from the depths of English dictionary good. I didn't even know Gen Z knew words like this! (I'm being facetious) Get to the literature citied and what do you know? Can't find a SINGLE article. Or, the article exists but the author doesn't match, or the journal, or the year, so it goes. I was able to confront and talk to one of them so far. They claimed that they effectively ""made up"" the citations FROM real ones they found, for whatever reason. Essentially denying the AI generated citation accusation. I told them they have two options, they can take a zero on the assignment plus the extra credit that I promised them as a class, and we could let this go as a lesson on fucking yourself over and they can pass the course with a grade a less than what they hoped for. They will get EXACTLY a 70%. Or if they would like to dispute the grade, we can bring it up to the academic integrity office and they can do their investigation, which is a ton of paperwork and will probably result in them not getting a consequence anyway but the risk of an academic record mark is still there. I firmly believe that they either AI generated their citations (more likely), or they fabricated the citations which still counts as cheating in our ""fabrication"" clause in the academic integrity policy of the campus. The other two students I'm having a harder time with, one of them has a report that looks like it was written by them because of the amount of errors and just general flimsiness of the grammar. But their citations are all over the place or non-existent too, but it feels more like they found citations that looked good and just sort of plugged them in where they needed them. So that to me just feels like a D assignment at best. The other student that has not responded yet is similar to the first student situation, beautifully written paper, fantastic vocabulary, riddled with citations that don't exist all throughout their paper. My issue is how do you write a paper so amazing and yet completely incorrect in so many ways! Is it reasonable to just give them zeros? Am I being mean? Should I give them a hand written restorative assignment for partial credit? I don't know. My supervisor say that it's too hard to detect AI, and prove it, so I should just grade their assignments as normal. This is year one for me, and I'm still trying to find a little bit of my backbone and where my philosophies are. But I am 100% about being very strict on cheating.

"Instructor dismissed my request of changing a grade that I got right because it was 7 weeks ago. I asked this on another thread but wanted to hear your opinions or similar experience like mine? I am a pre-nursing student who am at week 12 out of 15 left in this semester. This week, I took a quiz for this online class and got a 0 out of 1 on a fill-in-the-blank question because the system detected a space bar I made after typing the answer. However, i got the term right. Prior to this, I had a similar situation 7 weeks ago where I added a period at the end and was marked 1/2 off, but the term was correct. There are 2 instructors teaching the course and I didn’t it think through, so I just emailed one of them (instructor A) but I never got a response back. Where I messed up was, I forgot about it since I was just overloaded with assignments (i get 12-13 assignments weekly of other classes), work, etc. If anything, I assumed that she would reach back to me, but it never happened. Anyways, after seeing this error, it reminded me of the last quiz, so this time I emailed instructor B in case the other instructor may not reply again. I explained my situation and asked if both can be adjusted (I provided all screenshots) and she responds that I should have emailed her on the first quiz and instructor A on this week’s quiz because they’re in charge of certain modules. She adds that she will adjust this week’s for me, but the first “will not be addressed because it was 7 weeks ago”. I know where I messed up on my part. I was not attentive enough about making sure who to email because on each module, their names are provided on the side, and on the syllabus it briefly states that if we have any questions about a module, to email whoever is in charge. But at the same time, I feel this slight unfairness since Instructor A could have at least reached out and let me know, but she didn’t. I also feel that because my answers were literally correct, that this can be adjusted. It’s not like I’m asking to retake the quiz but informing that there was an error on the system. I understand that being on top of things is preparing me for nursing, but I feel that this is unnecessary and ridiculous that my correct answer cannot be graded because I was 7 weeks late asking the instructor who was in charge of that week now. I was going to confront about this respectfully, but decided not to since I didn’t want to overstep myself and give her the wrong impression of me wanting to stand my ground for a simple error and misunderstanding. Is this reasonable for me to feel this way? Has this happened to anyone? Edit: I wanted to clarify for those asking about the quiz being a small and minute point, this course is quiz-based and contributes 75% of the grade, so it makes a huge difference of my letter grade as it would have brought me from an 88% to a 90%. I did come to terms that it was some time ago and too late to ask, and although it’s just a few points, it also frustrates me knowing that I could have gotten an A. Edit #2: Thank you for your responses! This was also my first encounter where the points make a huge difference to my grade (I know this after inputting the “what-if” grades). It was also an error on both parts, as it turns out that the instructor had “re-graded” the first quiz but still marked it as incorrect.

"Do any paid Master’s programs in Economics exist. Hello, I’m trying to figure out if paid Master’s programs exist (Econ or other related fields). My situation is a bit hard.

"The highest in-state rates for public universities are in Pennsylvania - tipping the scales at around $18k. So you might consider checking again - while room &amp; board isn't included in that, $18k is still a long way from the out-of-state/private school tuition. You can - and should - appeal financial aid awards but, as a solution, it ranks up there with 'play the lottery' for outcomes. At least appealing is free (unlike the lottery). Community/Technical College is definitely a possibility, but you may find some resistance from your daughter. Living at home and taking classes with married 30-year-olds who got their GED last year probably doesn't hold much appeal for her. This is also just delaying the problem since she'll eventually transfer to a 4-year school. However, delaying the problem isn't necessarily a bad idea. You can target more downscale private schools who will eagerly give her merit scholarships next year and you can potentially build up some academic merit to get women-in-engineering scholarships. She can also just take a gap year, but I wouldn't recommend this unless there's a plan in place to do something useful with that gap year. A good rule of thumb is if it's not an experience that would translate into the kind of essay an admissions officer would enjoy reading, it's probably a bad idea. Hiking the Andes = good. Watching TV = bad. I feel compelled to mention that either getting married or waiting until age 24 would remove parents from the FAFSA and open up subsidized loans/Pell Grants based on her presumably non-existent income. The military is also an option. Not only does it grant independent adult status, but it also largely solves the tuition problem. The National Guard and Reserves also offer benefits if she doesn't want active duty and if she's willing to serve after college, ROTC can pay for schooling while she's getting it. The military academies are actually free, but that's almost certainly not an option. In terms of her attitude about the situation, I wouldn't be *too* surprised. It's fairly common for teenagers to think of their parents as an endless well of money - ie: she views money as a problem for you to solve rather than her. While she'll need to grow out of this attitude eventually, it's not unusual for an 18-year-old. In terms of math/science grades, it's tough to judge based on limited information. Math/science courses tend to be everyone's lowest grades - even engineering students. High school math courses also have a tendency to emphasize memorization over understanding while the reverse is true in college. If she's willing to work at it and isn't a total lunkhead, she can probably get through an engineering program. That being said, my experience is that most people *aren't* willing to work at it - in my undergraduate program, we had a 2/3rds attrition rate. What you *don't* want to do is take out private loans. The rule of thumb is never take on more debt that your first year salary, and private loans are the easiest way to break that rule.

"From an academic in Nazi Germany: “You see,” my colleague went on, “one doesn’t see exactly where or how to move. Believe me, this is true. Each act, each occasion, is worse than the last, but only a little worse. You wait for the next and the next. You wait for one great shocking occasion, thinking that others, when such a shock comes, will join with you in resisting somehow. You don’t want to act, or even talk, alone; you don’t want to ‘go out of your way to make trouble.’ Why not?—Well, you are not in the habit of doing it. And it is not just fear, fear of standing alone, that restrains you; it is also genuine uncertainty. “Uncertainty is a very important factor, and, instead of decreasing as time goes on, it grows. Outside, in the streets, in the general community, ‘everyone’ is happy. One hears no protest, and certainly sees none. You know, in France or Italy there would be slogans against the government painted on walls and fences; in Germany, outside the great cities, perhaps, there is not even this. In the university community, in your own community, you speak privately to your colleagues, some of whom certainly feel as you do; but what do they say? They say, ‘It’s not so bad’ or ‘You’re seeing things’ or ‘You’re an alarmist.’ “And you are an alarmist. You are saying that this must lead to this, and you can’t prove it. These are the beginnings, yes; but how do you know for sure when you don’t know the end, and how do you know, or even surmise, the end? On the one hand, your enemies, the law, the regime, the Party, intimidate you. On the other, your colleagues pooh-pooh you as pessimistic or even neurotic. You are left with your close friends, who are, naturally, people who have always thought as you have. “But your friends are fewer now. Some have drifted off somewhere or submerged themselves in their work. You no longer see as many as you did at meetings or gatherings. Informal groups become smaller; attendance drops off in little organizations, and the organizations themselves wither. Now, in small gatherings of your oldest friends, you feel that you are talking to yourselves, that you are isolated from the reality of things. This weakens your confidence still further and serves as a further deterrent to—to what? It is clearer all the time that, if you are going to do anything, you must make an occasion to do it, and then you are obviously a troublemaker. So you wait, and you wait. “But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds or thousands will join with you, never comes. That’s the difficulty. If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes, millions would have been sufficiently shocked—if, let us say, the gassing of the Jews in ’43 had come immediately after the ‘German Firm’ stickers on the windows of non-Jewish shops in ’33. But of course this isn’t the way it happens. In between come all the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D. “And one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying ‘Jewish swine,’ collapses it all at once, and you see that everything, everything, has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live in—your nation, your people—is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way. “You have gone almost all the way yourself. Life is a continuing process, a flow, not a succession of acts and events at all. It has flowed to a new level, carrying you with it, without any effort on your part. On this new level you live, you have been living more comfortably every day, with new morals, new principles. You have accepted things you would not have accepted five years ago, a year ago, things that your father, even in Germany, could not have imagined. “Suddenly it all comes down, all at once. You see what you are, what you have done, or, more accurately, what you haven’t done (for that was all that was required of most of us: that we do nothing). You remember those early meetings of your department in the university when, if one had stood, others would have stood, perhaps, but no one stood.

I honestly dont see myself doing any other undergrad besides environmental science and i don't want to major in like biochemistry or biology in case i don't get into med school. if i dont do medicine, i’d want to do something in environmental science/consulting/sustainability. im not super into the engineering side of things but ive heard that majoring in environmental engineering leads to better job options. im more interested in sustainability, remote sensing, arcgis, studying earth from space, stuff like that. another thing im worried about is my parents are kinda old and id like to start working sooner if possible, which makes me hesitant about going the med school route. if im being honest, i feel like georgia tech is a better fit for me, but im really worried about keeping a high gpa. for reference: * for environmental engineering + pre-med at tech, i’d still need to take BIOS 1208 + 1208L, CHEM 1211K, CHEM 1212K, CHEM 2311, CHEM 2312, and CHEM 2380 (6 classes) * for environmental science + pre-med at tech, i’d need BIOS 1208 + 1208L, CHEM 2311, CHEM 2312, CHEM 2380, and PHYS 2212 (5 classes). also, the environmental science major has 21 free electives but im not sure if all the pre-reqs would fit. * These dont include recommended courses although i dont think it matters i don't know how uga would work but I'm sure the pre-reqs are easier. If anyone could give any advice id be very grateful im just stressed out because the deadline for me to decide is may 1st",Fees,High,2.0,web:pullpush:r/ApplyingToCollege:submission:problem,High,2,1988,349,7,idk what to do help.,0
"Professor seems defensive to any questions but I still want to learn the material and have a good relationship. Hi professors (this is kind of a lot, sorry) Tl;Dr: prof is unkind and defensive when I ask relevant questions in class or by email. Classmates assure me I'm not being rude when I ask. Do I try to work on the relationship with her, sit back and shut up, continue as it's been, or talk to my advisor? I'm an education graduate student (teacher preparation program) and I have one class where no matter how I ask a question the professor gets defensive and harsh and dismissive. My cohort is pretty tight so we talk a lot and give each other feedback, and they are also confused as to why she gives me these kinds of responses. My questions are usually 1) clarification of a detail I didnt understand (or that a classmate didnt and asked me to ask because I'm a bit of a talker and not scared to speak up on zoom) or 2) looking for more depth or nuance. The class is a LOT of legal/policy stuff so I want to make sure I am (and my peers are) clear. I do know I can be a little tactless sometimes and so I try to be extra mindful (extra extra mindful over zoom and email) but my classmates have also brought it up unprompted after class how she gets so snippy with me and when I ask like ""did I come across shitty?"" they say no, her response came out of left field. I literally have never met this prof nor knew of her, anything before class started and it's been like this from the beginning so I just dont understand. It doesnt help that there was a specific incident where she did something inarguably bad (not necessarily unethical, but like.for the content she teaches she should have known better and it was very harmful to several students) and I approached her with as much grace as I could in the moment during class and afterwards privately but she was just dismissive and patronizing and it made everything worse. And even in emails she's curt and patronizing. It's so freaking upsetting to be met with her unkind responses when the info I'm seeking is genuinely helpful to me and other classmates. I dont want to stop asking because they generate a lot of useful discussion. But I cant keep dealing with her worsening temperament towards me. How do I handle this? Can I do anything to salvage the relationship? Do I just sit back and shut up? Do I ask my advisor (who's the chair of the department, yikes) for help? Or do I stick it out, try to ignore the crap, and keep asking questions? (Also idk if it's relevant context, but she is not tenured, does not have a Ph.D. yet, so I worry seeking outside support could cause more trouble for her than I want to cause (but judging by my peers feelings, the end of course evals may do that regardles.)) Edit: reference to my advisor and her credentials is because I know academia is hard and not having tenure sucks and I dont wanna cause undue drama for her by seeking advice from my advisor. I didnt pick my advisor, she was assigned to me (and promoted to chair after the fact) based on my content area). Edit: I should sit back and shut up.

"GRE not accepted anymore, so how can I balance out a bad GPA. **\*\*Edit: I'm looking for a coursework based masters, I'm NOT interested in doing research nor do I intend to pursue a PhD\*\*** In undergrad I had a bad GPA, due to something personal happening during my 3rd semester that I did not how to deal with and never knew how to recover from. College was literally the worst 4 years of my life emotionally, mentally, and physically. Due to that and mental health issues I just did not do well in classes and graduated with a 3.06. It was a T20 school back then and is T10 now but don't know if that matters. I graduated in 2017 with a BS in CS and have been working since then in a mixture of big tech and unicorn companies. I've always had the goal of going to grad school and ""rewriting"" my undergrad experience, and I'm genuinely in a much better headspace now. However, when I'm looking at grad programs now, almost all of them (masters in CS) do not accept GRE. Like, they outright refuse to look at it. Then how am I supposed to prove that I can handle the coursework now and am a different person now? It's ridiculous that I cannot prove my quantitative skills through the GRE. And as far as LORs go, obviously I wouldn't be able to get it from my teachers in undergrad, and idk who I would ask professionally. I'm not in touch with previous bosses and people don't realize that in big tech re-orgs happen a lot and you can switch teams / bosses. I worked at a big tech company for 3 years and had 6 different managers during that time. So it's not like any of my bosses would particularly remember or care about me. I feel really dejected at the moment since I thought GRE could be my saving grace and my chance to prove that I could do well in these courses, but now I don't know what to do.

"Random/Specific Tips to Surviving University (Studying, Assignments, Self). I wanted to make a little post on the more random tips for surviving university. If you're attending university soon, I hope these tips help. It's going to be long, but I will try to summarize. Here's some tips that helped me survive and also keep up. Also, english is not my first language so I hope it's readable. **Tip #1 Know your professor's/lecturer's personality. (Get to know them!)** This is important as their approach and teaching methods, willingness to help, etc. differs. Observe how they teach and engage with students, also try to interract with them by asking questions or advice. Friendlier or more open ones tend to be more helpful. Stricter or the ones that read from the slides and engages little to none are *usually* more reluctant in offering help to students. Most lecturers are open and understanding to students, some not so much because they're busy etc. It's not always fair, but we have to make do with the educators we have. If your educator is unhelpful and cold, you can ask questions from other approachable professors teaching in the same field/department. Developing relationships with professors can help you to get mentorship opportunities, letters of recommendation, and valuable academic advice. \*This might not apply to you personally, but based on my experience I have had lecturers who ignore messages or reply with ""why didn't you pay attention"" when I asked them questions. **Tip #2 Set up ""internal"" due dates for assignments and coursework.** Internal due dates are highly important as this gives you extra room for error and repair. Wether in group work or individual, always set an earlier date to complete your work before your submission date. This is to ensure that you do not procrastinate, have more time to work on your assignments, and for potential editing that you might need to do. Doing this not only ensures that you are ahead of schedule so you do not submit anything late, but also that you have more time to review your work. This tip is especially useful for people who tend to procrastinate and work better under pressure. This is also useful for group assignments when inevitably you might have to help your ~~useless~~ groupmates with their work. **Tip #3 Take advantage of your resources.** Wether it is reading the course outline or teaching plan or getting the textbook from the university library, take advantage always. If like me, you live in a country where you have to pay a lot of money to be in university, you are 100% entitled to utilize all of its resources. Wether textbooks from the library or mentors and alumini, just try to reach out to use these resources as much as you can. **Tip #4 Use a whiteboard to study and revise.** Buying a whiteboard (maybe around A3 size or bigger) is a great way to revise and study. It is easily erasable, you have a lot of space, and it's also budget friendly compared to using paper, notebooks, or buying an iPad. You end up using less paper too. It's one of the best things I use to study. **Tip #5 Find a good study spot.** A good study spot is optimal for focus and productivity. Find a place you are comfortable enough. Temperature, noise, access to food, amount of distractions are all important factors. Find one that works best for you. If you work better with noise and being in a public space: Go to a cafe/ university library. If you work better in a quieter or private place: Study at home in a secluded area (if any). You can also try work spaces or public libraries. Sometimes you'll have no choice on where to study, but you can still make a comfortable space for you to learn. \*Not on your bed though! You might associate your comfort place with stress. **Tip #6 Self Reflection** Think of why you are here in university. Some of are forced to be here due to whatever, but find meaning and purpose in what you are doing. Wether it is the interest of the subject, or vengance for those who doubted you (unhealthy but it works so whatever), reflect on that from time to time throughout your semester. Personally, I forget why I am studying and lose my focus and motivation. Remembering why is important to keep you grounded. You can do this by writing in a journal, or using those mood apps on your phone. It doesn't have to be long, as long as you think and reflect on yourself. **Tip #7 Have a notebook/app to organize your university/professional life from your personal life.** Try to have a notebook or app that is specifically for your professional life and ""seperate"" it from your personal life. Have a means of recording things you need to do for school. Of course education and personal intersect with one another like class schedules and other things; but having a means of organizing both is very useful. And a planner/calendar usually solves that problem. If you prefer an online resource, I recommend Notion or even a folder on your device. You can also use calendar and planner apps, all that. If you prefer a physical thing, I recommend a planner or a notebook. Weekly planners work best for me as I don't need to write a lot of things everyday and it already divided all the dates for me. My planner also has a monthly spread thing where I can write all the important dates and see all of that by month. I also get more freedom with doodles, sketches or related journal entries on it. You can note things down such as: tips from professors, due dates, examination dates, meetings, study and work plans, etc. Basically everything related to your day-to-day, put it all in one place and try to update it weekly. It has been a holy grail for me because I have 6 courses per semester and juggling that without organization is horrific. **Tip #8 Be adapatable** Adaptability is arguably one of the most important traits you can have whilst in university. You might have studied for weeks for an exam and still flunked it or you had plans to do something but it didn't work out. Whatever your situation might be, being adaptable is very important. Learing how to problem solve especially if things did not go the way you anticipated will help you progress foward into your university years. You can try this by trying to come up with solutions with made up problems or real ones. This can help with improving your problem-solving skills and improve your flexibility and adaptability. **End** All these tips might not solve all the problems you are facing in university, but I hope that it helps you in some way or another. Not all things will be smooth, but I ensure you that it's a learning journey!

"Considering taking summer courses to reduce my load this semester. I currently have 7 classes including a placement. I’m in a nursing program at a Canadian college (probably the equivalent of a community college in the states, University is what college is in the states). My schedule this semester is really overwhelming and I’m already finding myself feeling sick from stress. 2 of my classes are lab/theory classes, which entails 6 hours of lectures on Monday and then 7 hours of lab the next day. My other 2 days are also 8am - 5pm. Fridays I have an all day clinical placement. I have a learning disability which really only affects me in a particular subject. I have one class in the entirety of my program that involves this subject, which I have to take this semester. I know I’m going to need extra practice and studying to succeed in this course. With the schedule we have, this leaves me absolutely no time to seek the additional help I need from a tutor or from the student resource centres at my school, let alone extra study time on my own accord. This is my main concern about my schedule. I’m considering taking 4 courses now and 3 courses during the summer so that I can make room in my schedule for extra help and practice time in my difficult subject. I know that this is what I will need to succeed, but it’s impossible with the schedule I have now. I was told it wouldn’t be an issue with my school as long as I take the remaining courses in the summer semester, which is May-August. I finish my current semester in April, with 2 weeks off before I would start my summer semester. Everyone is telling me to tough it out, but I know it’s going to be incredibly difficult for me without any extra time to work around my learning disability.

"Am I delusional for wanting to be treated well by my PI in academia. TLDR: My PI, once supportive, turned hypercritical and dismissive during my Master's thesis, offering no positive feedback. After being publicly humiliated and overworked, I’m burnt out and questioning if I should stay. Feeling stuck and anxious about confronting her. Any advice? I submitted my Master’s thesis a few weeks ago, but instead of feeling relieved, I feel like garbage. I’ve been working in this lab as a research assistant alongside my studies for almost two years and enjoyed it until recently. My PI was supportive, gave me autonomy, and seemed pleased with my work. Her feedback on my previous lab reports were very positive and everything seemed great, so I decided to do my thesis there. Things were fine in the experimental phase, but when I submitted my first draft, she absolutely hated it and made me rewrite 25 pages from scratch in just 4 days, on top of other coursework. I complied and worked 16-hour days to deliver the best work that I possibly could, and she still didn’t give me any positive feedback, even though she couldn’t find anything to comment on. She still proceeded to lecture me on how I didn’t understand the field well enough. This pattern continued throughout the writing process, with little to no positive feedback and constant scolding. At the time, I thought she was just pushing me to reach my potential, and had raised her standards because this was a thesis and not a lab report. But when I finished everything with good grades and expected some positive reinforcement, she didn’t ease up. Another professor, known for making students’ lives difficult, publicly humiliated me after my presentation, and in a meeting afterwards, my PI said that I had deserved it. That’s when I finally broke down crying, to which she responded, “It’s good you’re crying, it means you care. I would cry too if I gave a terrible presentation.” But my performance had been solid, I was crying because I’d worked nonstop for almost two months (10+ hours a day, including weekends) and was still treated like a failure. When I expressed that I wasn’t upset about my performance but about never being good enough, she deflected everything and insisted that everything was my fault, saying I should have made better decisions, and if I had to work that much to deliver something so mediocre, I was spending my time wrong. Idk, maybe she was just to proud to admit that she had been too harsh. But I did get the impression that she felt bad about it, because she still tried to comfort me, by giving a generic motivational speech and hugging me at the end of the meeting. Since then, she’s been slightly nicer, but the pressure is still high. She assigned me to supervise a full-time intern, so I’m basically working full time on a part-time salary. She also often gives last-minute tasks, expecting them done over the weekend, without compensation of course. In these situations she says ”sorry, but you have to do it. It’s not a request.” I understand she’s under stress from budget cuts, publishing pressures, and other lab issues, but it feels like she’s taking it out on me. And I guess that I’m the easiest target, I’m a bit of a people-pleaser and don’t push back, unlike some of the other students, but I still don’t want to be anyone’s punching bag. It’s also a bit of a double-standard for her to expect a high level of professionalism of her students, when she doesn’t extend the same courtesy. There’s also a cultural clash, her culture puts more pressure on academic performance, but we’re in my country, where the expectations are different. In the end, it’s the local university standards that apply, I’ve gotten high marks and my thesis is far above the average, so I think it’s a bit unfair that she still treats it like a failure. Sure, she could still want her research group to perform in a certain way, but then I think she should be very clear about that. If she had told me straight up ""you need to score at least 95/100 on your thesis to do a PhD in my lab"" then I would have respected that, but she never even mentioned anything about ambition or specific expectations. I’ve been set on continuing with a PhD in this lab, but now I’m seriously reconsidering. I know academia is tough, but I can handle long hours and difficult work, I just don’t want to be treated this way. I haven’t applied anywhere else because I’ve been focused on this lab, so I don’t know if I’ll manage to get any other offers this late, and if those offers would even be any better. Anyway, I’ll have to confront my PI, but I’m really anxious about it and don’t know how to approach it. I’m afraid anything I say will make her defensive and interpret me like a spoiled teenager. What do you guys think? Is this really what academia is like? Should I leave for an industrial position instead? Any advice?",Academic,Medium,1.0,web:pullpush:r/academia:submission:issue,Medium,1,4899,866,0,Am I delusional for wanting to be treated well by my PI in academia.,0
"Teaching Anxiety. So, I'm a PhD student (in math), and like most PhD students, I have to teach low-level undergraduate courses. I have a TON of anxiety centered around giving grades. It drives me crazy. I put a lot of effort into designing what I consider ""fair"" grading schemes. This year, I taught a new class and by the end of the semester, I had to fail about 1/3 of my students. that's kind of a lot. But there was nothing I could do. Those students, I thought, genuinely didn't deserve to pass the class. It was a super basic pre-calc class and ALL the students who failed really didn't try that hard. They hadn't finished all their homework, did really really bad on exams, and didn't take advantage of any of the opportunities I offered to help raise their grades, like extra credit and makeups etc. Honestly, I don't think I was a perfect teacher and based on these experiences I will absolutely modify the way I teach. I'll essentially try harder to babysit the students next time. They need to be explicitly told ""you are going to fail this class if you don't change something"" much earlier in the semester. I HATE failing students. But it genuinely would be incredibly unfair to just randomly pass them after the fact. A couple of them sent a ton of emails to me, and I even got some emails from their parents. Then when I didn't budge on their grades, a couple went to my ""boss"" and complained that I was unfair. How common is this kind of thing? Do others feel like it causes them anxiety? I try really, really hard to make my class fair but at the end of the day, there's only so much I can do. If you barely show up to class, don't pay attention to your grade, and fail all my exams, I cannot help you. The main complaint was that they didn't KNOW that they were failing before they failed. Of course my grading scheme was in my syllabus but I suppose I didn't tell them, or post their calculated grade anywhere. Of course they could have calculated it themselves, but they didn't know how.

"I failed all my first year classes and I’m lost. I’m not asking for any sympathy I’m just stuck and really need some guidance Long story short I failed 7/8 courses in first year university. The only one I passed, I got a D-. I ended up failing not because I didn’t like my major or even because I don’t like learning and academics. I had a huge mental health episode all throughout my first year. For some background I moved about 5 hours from home to a big city to go to university as a life science student. Skipping some of the details, I’ve dealt with mental health issues in the past mainly anxiety but nothing this severe. Due to a really bad living situation(roommate from hell), new antidepressants that had the reverse effect and some unforeseen life events and health issues I feel into a severe depression and anxiety episode. Because of this I pretty much let myself fail all my courses, because I couldn’t even bring myself to drop out. I know it sounds stupid which is was but I was so depressed I’d don’t even have the energy to email to drop the courses I just let them pass me by. Now I’m facing the consequences. In April of this year, my family moved me back home and I was in intensive counselling and changed my antidepressants. Over this summer I really worked on myself. I ended up leaving that university and stayed home and enrolled in online university courses. My mental health and grades have both exponentially improved now that I have the resources I need and healed from the past year. I now am in 3 courses with an A, A- and A+ and. Because of the credits for each course I am a full time student. I determined with my family and therapist I’m now ready to try university again. However this is where my problems start. As much as these past months have helped me I feel pretty lonely and isolated being at home with no one and I miss being at in person classes and actually talking with people. I applied to 5 Ontario universities for the winter semester so this January. 3 of the universities rejected my application about 2 or 3 weeks after submitting it and the other 2 didn’t have space in the program. For the first 3 I wasn’t even able to submit my new midterm grades, meaning it was only based on my first year grades. For some background on my academic history, I graduated high-school with a 95% average and an IB certificate. Additionally I had the highest academic standing in my entire biology, ecology and anatomy sections of my highschool. I have also previously had gotten into each of these institutions upon my initial high school applications. I really don’t know what to do from here. I feel like it’s unfair that I was refused even though they didn’t have my new grades. But in the flip side my cGPA is still extremely low even with the increase in my academic performance. At this point if will take years of acing classes before I have a suitable cGPA. I feel stuck and like I will never be able to move in from this. No where will accept me and I don’t know how well I will be able to handle doing online courses because of the lack of human interaction and isolation. I so desperately want to be back in the school environment but at this point it seems impossible. I don’t even know if I’m able to maybe appeal some of the admissions decisions since they never received my new grades. I understand why i was refused but I feel like my first year grade really don’t reflect myself and my academic ability and achievements. I just want them to give me a chance but I understand that’s now how things work :( Any sort of guidance would be much appreciated! Be blunt, I feel so stuck and defeated. Will this ruin my chances of pursuing a major in biology(I want to become a researcher) I feel like my life is over",Academic,Medium,1.0,web:reddit:r/college:search:unfair grading,Medium,1,3767,699,0,I failed all my first year classes and I’m lost.,0

"Back to school blues. Hello! I'm going into my 1st master year (Belgium) the 16th of this month I dread it more everyday. My last bachelor year was pretty excellent grade wise (nothing to retake but pretty challenging) and last june, I was ready to take on this next school year with motivation and see it as a new chapter. But. We're now in september and my timetable just got updated for my upcoming year and i'm doing 8am-6pm every day. I knew that the master's degree would be challenging, but seeing the classes, seeing myself get up early and studying non stop is scary. I love studying all cozied up in the library for hours, but now I won't have time for that, only for classes. With each year ending I feel like I overcame my challenges from the past year but idk, i'm not so sure of myself anymore. It scares me. I have a pretty fragile academic self-worth (I took longer than the average to finish my bachelor, though ending it with really good grades) and I'm scared the master's will crush it. I don't know what to do? Right now i'm on vacation up until the 16th.

"Fucking parents make my College Life 10 times fucking harder. Just had an hour long argument with my parents on my upcoming spring schedule because my chemistry class is from 2 to 6 and that the reason I had such a late class is because “I waited last fucking minute” and “I want to sleep in in the morning like a lazy ass.” Well fuck you, because I didn’t procrastinate and I didn’t purposefully chose a late class just so I could sleep late. Beginning of the semester, I specifically went to a drop-in (counselors prioritize freshmen in appointments) counselor to verify if I have priority registration just in case shit like this would happen. He taps on his keys for like 5 minutes and says yes. News flash, he was talking out his ass. Registration rolls around and my registration was in fact, not early. I find out a day late, after I see all whopping 4 available Chem 1B classes for spring available filling up like crazy quick while my date is set a week later. So, I quickly meet up with both my success coach and another counselor. We talk and they tell me that counselor in the beginning of the semester of the mistaken. They tell me that there for second years, there’s another additional requirement I had to do (attend a workshop or write about your transfer uni of choice) that I guess the first counselor just fucking decided wasn’t important. So they tell me to make sure that I write about my transfer uni and that they would send a form in advance on the spot to their college system that would fix my fucked up registration. But here’s the catch; their slow ass system takes a day to update. So I finish that stupid ass writing requirement that day and wait. And like fucking clockwork, exactly a day later, the system lets me add classes. Only 2 days had passed, and all but two classes were open. A decent professor who I took over a previous summer, whose class starts at 2-6, and an absolute dogshit professor who is both hated on by people I have spoken to and on rate my professor whose class starts at 8 (AM)-1. Obviously the only real choice was the 2-6 class. So I take that and add an easy hybrid Stats class, leaving only me to find a random filler class to qualify as a full time student. So when my parents come around to ask me about my schedule, they have a mental breakdown. “Why didn’t you add classes early?” I couldn’t, the system literally doesn’t let you because my registration wasn’t open yet. “Why didn’t you take the other class?” Because I want to pass with something above a C. “You picked a class that starts late so you could sleep in?” Sure, because I just so love it when I have to drive at night and come home by 7. “Why didn’t you ask other people about who were good professors in advance?” I did, I had a ranking list of the potential professors, but like I said, the system won’t let me because my registration isn’t fucking open. “You didn’t see any posters or fliers about the class lists?” How the fuck would that have helped as A, everything’s fucking online nowadays, and B, the issue is with my fucked up registration date, not my knowledge of classes. Out of the hundreds of their “critiques,” the only semi-reasonable complaint I will accept is them telling me I should’ve went to the admission office for my classes. Like yeah, they’re probably more well versed or more adequate, but here’s the thing; why the fuck would I have ever gone there if for the past 2 semesters, the counselors did fine. What, I was supposed to magically know that in my fourth semester, a counselor was going to drop the ball? So I have a Calc. Exam Wednesday, A Chem. Exam next week, and finals the week after and now im feeling fucking drained and tired. I make shit work with what I am dealt. I don’t need them to hound me like I don’t have a slight idea what im getting up to. I survived 3 semester. I can handle another.

"Better to pursue a neuroscience PhD in Canada or US (as a Canadian citizen). wall of text ahead: Hi, I'm a Canadian student that will be finishing undergrad soon and am interested in pursuing a PhD in neuroscience.

From what read and heard so far, Canadian neuroscience is nowhere near the caliber of neuroscience in the US. Our top schools for neuroscience (UofT, UBC, McGill, etc.) aren't really that competitive. There aren't really any labs that are crazy ground-breaking nature paper machines. The major Canadian neuroscience conference (CAN) is tiny compared to the one in the States (SFN). It just feels like the level of research and the opportunities available are significantly lower. I think it'd be naive to say there is no difference that can't be compensated for by just grinding textbooks and papers all day; it might be true but it misses the point. On the other hand, leaving Canada has its own set of issues. This is taken from the University of Washington's prospective international neuro student page: &gt; Unlike students who are US citizens or immigrants, international students have limited funding opportunities available and have an added burden when finding a lab for their dissertation projects. This seems to be the way it is for international student anywhere. I don't really have any sense of how bad it really is though, and I can only base my current perception of pursuing a PhD in Canada vs. not Canada from coworker anecdotes and vague warnings like the quote above. Yes, I can look up the international tuition fees for a neuroscience grad student at any school. But how rough does it really get beyond that? How much of a disadvantage is being an international student with respect to getting external funding or awards? If you really want to move up in academia, how bad is Canadian neuroscience really? It all just seems so cryptic to me. Any insight would be greatly appreciated, thanks!",Library,Medium,1.0,web:reddit:r/gradschool:search:fee issue,Medium,1,2842,501,13,Better to pursue a neuroscience PhD in Canada or US (as a Canadian citizen).,0

"Is it worth extending my studies to improve CGPA (Accounting, Malaysia). Hi everyone, I need some advice and outside perspective. I’m currently an accounting student in Malaysia. I did some CGPA calculations and right now my CGPA is 2.56. I still have 2 long semesters + 1 short semester left before graduating. Based on my calculation: If I don’t extend (2 long sem + 1 short sem), I’ll likely graduate around Feb 2027 with a CGPA of about 2.65. If I extend and take 3 long semesters instead, I’ll graduate around July 2027 with an estimated CGPA of about 2.77. So basically, it’s a choice between graduating earlier with a slightly lower CGPA, or graduating later with a better CGPA. For context: My course is Accounting I have 6 months experience as an Accounts Assistant And 6 months internship as a Corporate Tax Preparer My question is: Is it hard to get a job in accounting with a CGPA around 2.6–2.7?

"EdD Experiences with Work/Life/School Balance. Hello Everyone! I'm a career educator (10 years in) with a Masters in Curriculum &amp; Instruction currently considering an online EdD from UNC-CH. I've been a classroom teacher, reading interventionist, instructional coach and am currently an Assistant Principal all within the charter school world. I've been at my current school for eight years and due to a multitude of reasons, feel a little but stuck and have been thinking about moving in a different direction. I'm being considered for a district literacy specialist position at the state level and as I think about this potential shift, I'm wondering if getting my EdD could open up higher positions at the state level particulary around program coordination and curriculum oversight. I also honestly just feel like I'm ready to be back in an academic envornment where I can push myself to develop new knowledge &amp; skills in a field I'm passionate about. My one hold up is, my husband &amp; I are also actively trying to have our first (and more than likely only) kid. I completed my Masters while working full time as a teacher, but before we were married and obviously no children yet. There were a lot of late nights and plenty of times, I was stretched thin, but I did it! I'm worried that a 3-Year program while potentially moving into a new job, pregnant and then having a newborn/infant is certifiably crazy.

"**2023 email from Heather Mac Donald** As I was taking my evening power walk in the hood here (upper east side) and seeing all the nannies of color walking school children back to their apartments, it struck me again the bizarreness of females deciding that their comparative advantage is in being an associate in a law firm, say, and thus that they should outsource the once in a lifetime unduplicable unrepeatable experience of raising a unique child to some one else, especially someone from the low IQ 3rd world, while they do the drone work of making partner. The child is evolving so quickly, absorbing so many influences, and yet they would rather absent themselves from its life to show that they are as good as males. such a distribution of labor is allegedly pareto optimal. Another curse of feminism. Ms. Mac Donald, some Claremont friends and a conservative Canadian professor also discussed a routine in which the comedian Bill Burr took feminists to task for the low attendance ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QY9Gz\_IMn\_k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QY9Gz_IMn_k)) at WNBA games. (“None of you showed up! Where are all the feminists?”) When Ms. Mac Donald asked why the comedian hadn’t been “canceled,” Mr. Williams, Claremont’s president, pointed out that Mr. Burr was “married to a black woman, which helps.” Ms. Mac Donald replied, “We are all just SO grateful if there is a black who does not overtly hate us.” She went on to rail against a libertarian podcast that praised former President George W. Bush for selecting Black people for his cabinet, “as if there is any talent required to make quota appointments.” **2023 email from Heather Mac Donald** Hilarious. the usual pet black phenomenon. We are all just SO grateful if there is a black who does not overtly hate us. **The Movement Grows** Since 2021, the network’s anti-D.E.I. campaign has spread to at least a dozen states, according to the documents. In Tennessee, where Claremont partnered with Velocity Convergence, one of the anti-D.E.I. reports they produced reportedly ([https://tennesseelookout.com/2022/02/17/conservative-report-affects-higher-education-anti-diversity-bill/](https://tennesseelookout.com/2022/02/17/conservative-report-affects-higher-education-anti-diversity-bill/)) circulated among Republican state lawmakers as they worked to pass a bill limiting how universities could teach or train students about “divisive concepts.” A spokeswoman for the University of Tennessee said in a statement that the report's conclusions ""seem to be based on subjective criteria, made-up definitions and the opinions of the authors,"" who obtained information from online searches and public records but “made no attempt to understand the information through questions or interviews.” Tennessee’s governor signed the new law ([https://www.wbir.com/article/news/education/utk-faculty-reject-divisive-concepts-law-tennessee/51-f850afcb-b67d-45c9-be73-022dc96b13d1](https://www.wbir.com/article/news/education/utk-faculty-reject-divisive-concepts-law-tennessee/51-f850afcb-b67d-45c9-be73-022dc96b13d1)) in April 2022. Susan Kaestner, Velocity’s founder and a veteran Republican operative in the state, said that “the obsessive focus on diversity, equity and inclusion is effectively reducing viewpoint diversity on Tennessee campuses.” Last year, Claremont organizers forged connections with the Arkansas Senate’s Republican leader. In Alabama, they partnered with a group called Alabamians for Academic Excellence and Integrity. Jeff Sessions, the former U.S. attorney general and a supporter of the Alabama group, was among those who provided funds for a Claremont report ([https://dc.claremont.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Going-Woke-In-Dixie-Report-3.pdf](https://dc.claremont.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Going-Woke-In-Dixie-Report-3.pdf)), “Going Woke in Dixie?,” that focused on Auburn University and the University of Alabama. After it was released last summer, according to another email, Samuel Ginn, a wealthy Auburn alumnus and donor to both the school and Claremont, confronted the university’s president, Christopher B. Roberts, and pressed him to address the report’s findings. “The president then told him, ‘Things will change,’” a Claremont fund-raiser wrote to Dr. Yenor and other officials there. An Auburn spokeswoman said in an email that Dr. Roberts “has no recollection of the comment that was attributed to him.” Efforts to contact Mr. Ginn were unsuccessful. Ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, the group also teamed with Republican political operatives and a think tank in Maine — where Mr. Klingenstein owns a vacation compound — to gather examples of “D.E.I. in action” in the state’s public universities and K-12 schools. Mr. Klingenstein suggested highlighting examples of putatively odd-sounding college courses, as another conservative group had done in a report about left-wing influence at Bowdoin College in Maine. (Among them were “Queer Gardens” and “Sex in Colonial America.” Bowdoin responded by defending its coursework and calling the report distorted and “meanspirited.”) **2022 email from Thomas Klingenstein** When NAS reviewed the Bowdoin curricula NAS highlighted courses such as ""Queer Gardens, "" ""Sex in Colonial America"". These were the sorts of thing that got peoples' attention. How do we show a video of DEI in action? After the group published a report ([https://mainepolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/CSJ-in-Maine-K-12-Education-FINAL.pdf](https://mainepolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/CSJ-in-Maine-K-12-Education-FINAL.pdf)) on “critical social justice” in Maine’s K-12 classrooms, Mr. Klingenstein noted in one email that despite the need to reform public schools, the group faced difficulty figuring out what was “actually happening on the ground.” He praised the report but acknowledged it was “necessarily rather anecdotal.” Even so, the work could be wielded as a bludgeon. By fall 2022, the effort had expanded to include an advertising campaign against the state’s Democratic governor, Janet Mills. The campaign, funded by Mr. Klingenstein, was spearheaded by a national advocacy group called the American Principles Project, which in turn operated through a front group called Maine Families First. **2022 email from Thomas Klingenstein** As you know, Scott Yenor did a report on K-12 education in Maine. It was very good but necessarily rather anecdotal. Could we do, would it make sense to do, an in-depth analysis of one school or one school district a la the Bowdoin report. We might analyze one school/district in Portland, which is all in on social justice, and one in Northern Maine which is more traditional. I wonder if we could get enough information to do this.

"my reflection on the last few years - some random student located somewhere, usa. honestly this is me just rambling and putting my thoughts and feelings about the ups and downs of high school here for myself. it's like one of those hs relationships that you always knew was going to end eventually. so yeah, it's over. it's no one's fault really. it's just natural. this was supposed to happen. and although i absolutely hated the all-nighters, the stress, the workload, the competition, the people at times, and myself in those moments where i'd catch myself having really pessimistic thoughts about myself and my future, i think i'm starting to develop an appreciation for the whole experience. yes, i go to a competitive public high school with a *super* toxic environment. no, i'm not going to complain about it. i have made a lifetime's worth of complaints about this place in the last four years. here are my realizations: 1. **here's the plan for my future. here's my exact career path. here's every single detail of what's to come.** sike. it doesn't work like that. obviously, you should keep the future in mind, but you need to do well *here and now* for that future to become more concrete. that’s coming from someone who only finds true comfort when they have shit planned out to the minute. i feel like although it’s a good thing because it keeps you organized and focused, becoming too dependent on that plan can also hurt you. you will naturally tend to panic whenever your plan doesn’t work out *exactly* how it “should have” which can also be a detriment to you. trust me, i get it. certainty is what we crave, but improvisation is just as important and honestly, you really do have time. every person you consider “successful” now has come across these dilemmas in the past. it’s impossible to know exactly what you want and need to an extreme level of detail at every point of your journey. 2. **work now, play later.** again, that's just not how it works, but let me clarify my thoughts about why. yes, when it comes to day-to-day procrastination, you should most definitely be getting your work done before you enjoy yourself. however, you need to strike the right balance for yourself. something i often forgot to do in hs was have fun. of course i did, but it could have been an even better experience. you are the biggest priority. every bit of effort you put into those years is for **you**. you are not synonymous with your work, so don't try to be. i know it seems like a race and i don't necessarily agree with that comparison, but let's go with it for this point. have you ever seen a runner hold their breath for the entirety of their event? **no.** take breaks. make time for yourself. relax. do something, anything, just because you enjoy it. inhale. exhale. 3. **if i give something my all, i will be rewarded and i will feel content.** not necessarily. that's not to say you shouldn't try or that you should always take shortcuts. you should be trying your best for the things that matter. however, don't set your hopes and dreams on just one achievement because after you get there, it won't fulfill you forever. don't depend on achievements for your happiness or self-worth. chasing such things and setting them on a pedestal will only haunt you in the end. we are human beings. what makes us different from other animals is our ability to grow. chase improvement. it allows you to continue on your journey forever. that way, you will be happy when you make progress, but you will never have a cap on that happiness or sense of achievement. contentment is not the end goal. 4. **i deserve success.** no, you don't. i believe in the idea that honest work deserves to get rewarded very strongly, but that's all it is: an idea. by no means am i saying that success is not a good thing and shouldn't be a goal, but something i have accepted is that it's not always the end result. getting as close to your idea of success as possible is what you may end up with. or maybe you'll be incredibly far from it. and that's ok. when you take a chance, you are accepting the fact that luck is involved and there is a very real possibility that the odds will not be in your favor. the key here is to control what you can control for as long as you can. worrying past that point is not worth it. and honestly, it won't do anything but harm you. approach what you want with a clear mind. do what you can. after that, it is what it is. whatever happens happens. 5. **i will never be enough.** stop saying that. you'll find yourself believeing it. now i'm not one to sugarcoat things. maybe you really aren't good enough for what you want *as of now*. but pitying yourself gets you absolutely nowhere. all it does is ruin your self esteem and makes you develop one of the worst phobias there is: the fear of taking a chance. if you continue looking down on yourself, you will fear putting effort into anything because of that inevitable chance of failure. you need to reflect on yourself even if it makes you feel horrible. because it will never get better unless you do. don't lie to yourself either because when the reality hits, you'll feel like your world is breaking apart. whether you're doing well or badly, the one affirmation you need is ""i will be enough."" note the future tense. improve until it becomes present. 6. **college will make me succeed.** haha. lol. lmao. no, it won't. you will make yourself succeed. the college part will help, but in the end, it's you. and if you don't believe that, fake it 'till you become it. you are going to college for the life that comes after it. ok, that's it from me. if you read this whole thing, thank you! it's probably worthless since it's just the point of view of one high school senior, but these things have helped me. in a way, this is my way of showing i have grown from the prideful yet naive freshman i once was. in fall, i'll go back to that. i guess that's ok, but god that seems awful. time to jump into the ocean and become a fish glub glub",Fees,Medium,1.0,web:pullpush:r/ApplyingToCollege:submission:complaint,Medium,1,6027,1100,7,"my reflection on the last few years - some random student located somewhere, usa.",0

"Creating a private community for college. Last summer, we built a private community platform for our college as our final sem project. We plan to provide this platform to other colleges as well. If you want to create a private network for your university, you can now do so on [adostrings.com](https://adostrings.com/). Some of the ways we use it in our university. 1. Discuss the problems in the university. 2. Promoting oneself to allow them to find better opportunities on the campus 3. Direct messaging to other students and Professors. 4. Clubs of universities announce upcoming events. 5. Searching for people with specific skills for specific events. How to set it up? 1. You will have to sign up using your university mail id. This prevents people outside your university from joining your university's private network. 2. You will have to join or create a private network for your university. If you have created it, you’ll be the admin. 3. Once you join your university, you can update your profile, add links to your blogs, GitHub, etc., and add your hobbies, skills, and achievements. You can now search for people with specific skills for your football team or your dance groups or a teammate for your project. Discuss the problems in your university, announce events, clubs, and more.

"My sub-discipline is extremely international. We do, in fact, have some fully online events, as well as in-person events with options for attendees (not presenters) to join online. These events tend to be small and organised by a few faculty members and graduate students (or in one case, one extremely dedicated and tech-savvy professor). The downside is that it is not possible to get all the benefits of a small conference, such as continued discussion over coffee/tea/beer/food. The benefit is that they are free. The main US-based professional organisation in my discipline has also started to hold some of the larger conferences online. Unfortunately, the cost of running such a large conference online is extremely high. As a result, the registration fee is still prohibitively expensive for those of us from developing countries, and while my uni has travel money, they are not likely to fund such a large amount for an online event. From what I've been told, attendance at these larger events is also pretty bad. It is just not worth it, unless the only objective is a CV line.

"Do my fellow grad students trying to unionize overestimate the value they provide to the school. The grad students at my school have been trying to unionize, their main requests being higher stipends and improved medical insurance. I sympathize with their arguments, especially given the rising cost of living in the area, but my main concern is that I struggle to equate the work that we provide as grad students with the work provided by employees in non-academic worker unions. I'm not convinced, in other words, that my peers have a realistic grasp of the value they provide to the school. They complain about their heavy teaching and faculty research workloads, but in my experience these occupy perhaps a third of my time at most (I'm a PhD student with a maximum service load for my program), while the rest is spent on my personal classwork and research projects. Even the service work we provide is intended for our benefit, as most PhD students are assumed to be training for a career in academia, in which teaching and research are common components. What I don't think the other students recognize is that the entire endeavor of pursuing a PhD is essentially selfish -- in a normal scenario, the university waives your tuition and actually pays *you* to learn, providing with pretty comprehensive training for an academic career, while you provide comparatively less in return. It's an enormous bestowal of generosity and trust, so I just don't see the equivalence, for instance, with employees at a steel plant working 9-5, who hope to maintain their job across their adult life and then enjoy an honest retirement. What I've said might come across like a boomer rant, labeling the youngsters as ""whiny, entitled brats"", which is certainly not my intention. Like I said, I'm sympathetic to their complaints, especially as they relate to the rising cost of living in the area. Perhaps it's also logical that if the university has available funds, why shouldn't they filter them down to the grad workers? No one minds making more money after all, even those who might not need it as much. I suppose I'm just disillusioned by the extent of the student requests, and the degree to which they feel aggrieved by the system, when ""the system"" is in many ways providing them with a pretty sweet deal that will pay enormous dividends if they're successful in the job market. And if there are some financial hardships in grad school, isn't that to be expected? Most people are poor and overworked when they're a student -- it's a very condensed and hectic period of your life, in which you receive intensive professional training which then ideally pays off later in the form of a lifelong career. I do have fewer financial burdens than some of my peers because I'm comparatively young, I'm not an international student, and I also have a strong family support system. But I still feel that even in more trying circumstances, the grievances which the grad students level against the school would be overly dramatic to me. Feel free to enlighten me, and to offer your reasoning as to why you feel grad student unions are necessary, and merited by the work that we provide! I would also appreciate examples of when you believe student unions have gone too far, since perhaps I need some context in seeing the pragmatism of my peers' demands",Examination,Medium,1.0,web:reddit:r/gradschool:search:complaint,Medium,1,3341,574,5,Do my fellow grad students trying to unionize overestimate the value they provide to the school.,0

"I feel like a failure. I'm a 21 year old commuter student at a residential school. I do not feel like I have the power to do anything. I can't get myself to do my homework, pay my bills, or even clean my room. Every day feels like I'm going to war with my brain trying to force it to desire the harder task. Instead, I pass my hours watching YouTube and Netflix. At the start of every semester I tell myself things are going to be different. This will be the semester where I reclaim my academic drive and success. In high school I was driven to succeed, It was common for me to pull all nighters if that's what it took to achieve. I used to get this gut wrenching feeling that put me into action if there was a test the next day or a project that needs to be completed. Yesterday, I missed an exam on purpose because I saw no point in going. I didn't study, didn't read the textbook, couldn't get myself to do anything related to the course no matter how hard I try. The worst part is, if I start studying, it isn't even that bad. I actually enjoy what I'm studying but I can't get myself started for the life of me. If I do start on something, the chances that I follow through and stay consistent are dismal. I feel even more frustrated because I was a good student in high school and even achieved a 4.0 my first semester of college. I want to achieve, but I can't put myself to action. I also do not have a single friend. I'm part of some clubs but they meet inconsistently due to covid so it feels impossible to form a friendship. And when I have the chance to converse, I can't muster what to say because two years of isolation have devastated my social capabilities. I've ran away several times. The pandemic has made it easier to run because I can do all my classes online. For the first half of 2021, I was living in my car and couchsurfing across the country. Eventually I ended up in California and stayed there for about 3 months. I was working in a hostel and as door dash driver. It was fun. I made an amazing group of friends, and even landed my first girlfriend. I was almost tempted to drop out and stay in California but ultimately I decided my best bet is to get my degree. Thus, I returned home saying to myself things are going to be different. Spoiler: they weren't. My grades weren't bad. I had a 3.2 gpa. The loneliness kicked in again and I ran away again. I was talking with my girlfriend about how I was disatisfied with college and how I missed her. So, running from my problems again I went to go see my girlfriend. in Peru. I spent about little over a month in Lima and Cusco and had a blast but my school moved back in person so I had to come home. No surprise I still hate it here and still feel lonely and isolated. My parents think I'm fine. They think I'm receiving good grades, but I'm failing a class. They think I have a job, but I quit 5 months ago. They still think I have money, but I spent it all due to my impulsiveness. I feel afraid to go to my family, I've always had trouble opening up to my mom. We get along, but if I have a problem she usually can't relate. She just shrugs it off. The only person I could feel like I could trust was my dad and he passed over a year ago so now I only have my girlfriend and one friend I can turn to but they both live on the other side of the world so it's hard. At times, I feel like college isn't for me. However, I do love to learn. I spend a lot of my free time reading philosophy, history, and studying linguistics.

"Starting a business focused around helping local university seniors with design projects. Disclaimer: I am not seeking to do projects for students or help them cheat in any way. I would not advertise like that. I would be very clear about those kinds of boundaries; I am instead aiming to provide help with ancillary aspects that are unrelated to the primary focus of the final project, and would revolve mostly around just 3D printing models that they send me. Hello all, I am looking at starting a business for designing and selling components like 3D printed parts or basic circuit boards or simple programs, and I was debating on if the nearby university would be a good place to find customers. Background: I have a BS in ECE, with a concentration in electrical engineering. I am also an avid hobbyist and have been for years. Ive done a couple small-fry sales for some little projects here and there. I work professionally as an engineer, but that would be disconnected from this business. I also live just down the street from a medium sized university. Essentially title, does it sound unethical to you guys for me to pursue this? Again, I am very clear that I am not trying to help students get an unfair advantage or skip doing the work. I understand the importance of doing your own work for your senior design project but I also think context matters. If a task is way outside the scope or means of the student's project, I think its fair to offer assistance for a fee. Some examples of the kind of work id be trying to get: 1. say a student had a design for a 3D printed object, but the lab on campus (its tiny) is overbooked towards the end of the semester, I could 3D print and post process it for them to assemble and test 2. An environmental science student is doing a capstone project about greenhouse environment conditions, but they are having a hard time setting up an Arduino to record the temperatures in their greenhouse. I could program the board for them. Since their degree and project have nothing at all to do with programming or embedded systems, I personally dont see an issue with offering services like that, but I can kinda see how someone might, so im asking. I picture that, with every student who might approach, we would be sitting down to discuss what their major is, what the project is, what my scope of work would be, what my deliverables would be, timeline, and id imagine having them sign something too, where they are signing off on an agreed timeline and scope of work, so everyone knows what I am actually doing and what I am not doing for the student.

"Student forum. student forum is a structured platform—physical or digital—where students gather to discuss issues that matter to them. These can include academic concerns, extracurricular activities, campus policies, mental health, diversity, and more. Forums may be officially recognized by educational institutions or run independently by student groups. Why Student Forums Matter 1. Promoting Student Voice Student forums empower individuals to express their opinions, offer feedback, and influence decisions that impact their education and daily life. They provide a channel between students and faculty or administration, helping to shape a more inclusive and responsive educational environment. 2. Encouraging Collaboration Forums foster a spirit of teamwork. Students from diverse backgrounds come together to discuss common interests, debate important issues, and propose solutions to campus challenges. This encourages tolerance, understanding, and unity. 3. Developing Leadership and Communication Skills Active participation in a student forum helps students build essential life skills. Leading a discussion, presenting an idea, or organizing an event hones communication, critical thinking, and leadership—skills that are invaluable beyond the classroom. 4. Creating a Supportive Community Student forums often evolve into safe spaces where students feel heard, supported, and respected. In such environments, mental health topics, academic stress, and social concerns can be addressed without judgment, fostering a sense of belonging. Online Forums: A Modern Shift In the digital age, online student forums have become increasingly popular. Platforms like Discord, Reddit, Microsoft Teams, or school-specific discussion boards allow students to engage from anywhere, at any time. These forums are especially helpful for distance learners or students with busy schedules. Making the Most of a Student Forum Be Respectful: Value others’ opinions, even if they differ from your own. Healthy debate is encouraged, but respect is key. Stay Informed: Participate in discussions that are meaningful and relevant. Research topics before contributing. Be Active: Don’t just observe—engage! Ask questions, suggest ideas, and attend meetings or events. Conclusion Student forums are more than just platforms for discussion—they are engines of change, creativity, and connection.

"How do I stop feeling guilty for letting my parents pay for my oos tution. My dad used to tell me, jokingly, that he didn't mind paying for my college tuition because I was his retirement plan. I went to an Ivy, and while Dad had a decent job and retirement investments, we were solidly middle class - not even upper middle class. Because of that education, when he got sick with cancer, I was in a position for him and Mom to move in with me, and I took care of both of them (shopping, driving them to doctor's visits, etc.) until they each passed. I was able to help my oldest two through college and my youngest now - because of the investment Dad made in me. Don't feel guilty.

"What should I do to make my ECs better for the next few years? (Planning to do bio/premed). Hello everyone! I’m a current freshman in a competitive SoCal public high school.

"Would You Pay for a Peer Listener/Coach for Self-Improvement and Mental Health Advice. Hi Redditors, I’m seeking your input on a business idea that I’ve been considering. I’m someone who has been on a journey of self-improvement and personal development for quite some time. Over the years, I’ve accumulated a lot of knowledge and experience in this area. One of my strengths is being a good listener, and I often find myself offering advice and support to friends and family. This got me thinking – could I turn this into a business? Here’s the idea: I’d offer sessions where I listen to people’s concerns, challenges, and goals related to self-improvement and mental health. I would provide a supportive ear and, when appropriate, share advice based on my knowledge and experience. The goal would be to create a safe space for people to talk about their issues and receive constructive feedback. I want to clarify that while this might sound similar to seeing a psychologist, my service would be more approachable and easy-going.

"The process is unfair for sure. Many examples of how it’s unfair are obvious, but the proportions/percentage some things are unfair is usually different than most people think. Here’s the reality though- at private institutions, they don’t owe us anything. They’re private entities and can mostly do what they please. And technically, the public has the power to change things- but it would require a full scale collective decision for applicants all over the country to do things so differently in the college process that changing it will never happen, unfortunately. College is such an anomaly in that people still put all of these places they find so unfair near the tops of their list and mold their lives for 2 years, 4 years, sometimes longer about trying to be what they think these places want them to be with hopes of getting in. If the entire nation just said they aren’t doing it anymore, went to their public schools in state for like 2 or 3 years- some stuff would change- but it won’t. When kids come to me early in high school asking what they need to do- I tell them I can give them some type of Roadmap to having a competitive application, but the reality is they can have perfect grades, highest courses, and a resume that outclasses many adults and it still guarantees nothing.

I figure I'm not the only grad student who was asked to write an evaluation, especially since I don't work with this professor very closely (he's not on my committee, I've never TA'ed for him, and he and I work in different areas of the discipline). I've been told that the professor may see my letter with my name redacted; everyone else who reads it (including other faculty in my department and various higher-up administrators) will see it with my name included. Here's my concern: Everything I've heard about this professor from the grad students I know who have TA'ed for him makes me think there are serious problems with his undergraduate teaching and his management of TA's. Some of the reports describe behaviors that I think are unacceptable without a doubt: he disparages undergrads behind their backs (in his conversations with TA's), sometimes claiming that certain undergrads don't deserve to be at our institution; he berates TA's who encourage students to attend his office hours, saying he doesn't want students in his office hours; he refused to accommodate a student who had to miss an exam for a family member's funeral (apparently the issue wasn't that he didn't believe the student about what happened; he just didn't think it warranted accommodation). He also makes some pedagogical choices that I disagree with, although I realize there might be more room for debate on these: he prohibits his TA's from using any supplementary materials - including handouts/outlines or slides - in their discussion sections and requires them to say nothing to students beyond repeating what he said in lectures, even though one of the criteria on which our institution evaluates TA's is the extent to which we ""expand on the scope of lectures""; he sets a strict quota on how many A grades he awards per course (not sure if there's also a quota for the other grades, or just for the A's), with the consequence that TA's often have to downgrade students not based on the quality of their work but simply in order to meet the quota. More generally, this professor is the one whom TA's most frequently try to avoid getting assigned to, because of his reputation. While thinking about whether/how to address these concerns in my evaluation, I came up with two questions. First, as a general matter, is it ok to submit a negative evaluation in response to a request like this? I wasn't asked by the professor for a letter of recommendation; I was asked by the department for a letter of evaluation, and they asked me to give my ""candid assessment."" But I'm pretty inexperienced, so I don't know whether to take them at their word on the ""candid"" part. Second, assuming it's \*generally\* ok to submit a (truthful) negative evaluation in response to this kind of request, would it be ethical for me to describe the concerns I have, given that I've only heard them second-hand? In a draft of my letter, which I've not yet sent, I list all the concerns (and include some explanation of why I find them concerning) but preface the list with a strong disclaimer, saying that I'm reporting what I've heard from multiple TA's (whom I don't identify) but haven't been in a position to observe myself, and that while I consider these TA's to be trustworthy, I think anyone who considers acting on the concerns I raise should first verify them by talking directly to the professor's current and former TA's and undergrad students. But perhaps it's irresponsible to report second-hand information, even with the disclaimer, given the potentially high stakes for the professor? The main motivation I have for reporting the concerns described above is that I think this professor is negatively impacting his students and TA's (partly by making them miserable and partly by giving them bad training/modeling at the start of their teaching careers, and so potentially negatively impacting \*their\* future students too), and I hope that by including this information in his teaching review, I might prompt someone in authority to make him demonstrably improve his teaching, perhaps as a condition of further promotion/pay raises. If you think this is hopelessly naive of me, please be honest :) The main reasons I can think of \*not\* to report the concerns are (1) that it might result in backlash against the TA's from whom I heard the concerns (even though I don't identify them, it's possible the professor could guess who they are, and some of them work in his area and therefore depend on him for stuff like committee advising and letters of rec), (2) that it might be unfair to the professor, given that I've only the concerns second-hand, and (3) that it might be risky for me, either because the professor might guess my identity and somehow try to retaliate against me (though, again, we don't work in the same area so I'm not sure that's a huge risk) or because other professors in my department who read the letter with my name attached will think worse of me for writing a negative evaluation (e.g., maybe they'll start to see me as a grad student who is generally out to get professors in trouble; I don't think that would be accurate but I can see why they might think it).

"This class is pretty easy overall, too bad it is probably the worst run class in the science faculty. A lot of overlap from high school physics. Very unorganized course, you'll have to teach yourself most of the topics as in class profs will go over just a few examples then leave the rest for groupwork. This class is made so much more difficult than it has to be, you are forced to do things the way they want you to do them which was difficult for me as in high school my physics teacher encouraged us to stick with whatever works best for us. To sum up, this is a class that should not cause you too much trouble but due to the way it is run, it may. Brenda Lee was a great prof, too bad Sanderson is in charge.

"Is this a serious infraction. I am looking for outside opinions on whether this is even an infraction a school could apply disciplinary action for. So basically I falsely received a parking ticket for a spot which I had paid for. I submitted an appeals which proved I paid for the spot. I waited for three weeks to receive a response without one. During this time I was unable to order transcripts which I needed. There was no office I was able to visit in person or even call to settle this matter. I lost my cool a little bit and sent an email saying that it was bullshit and fucking ridiculous that the processing time was taking so long when I should not have been issued the ticket in the first place. This was my exact wording. Afterwards the ticket was dropped but now the school scheduled me for a meeting with the Student Conduct committee over this email. I have been a member of the university for four years and never had any infractions. Yes it was stupid of me to lose my cool, but I dont think its such a big deal.

"Tips for Incoming Freshmen (and all students) from the Writing Center. Hi y'all. Basically, work in my school's Writing Center and I've been seeing a lot of ""hacks"" or ""tips"" or question, etc. about writing essays and I wanted to put out a few tips for y'all. 1) Obviously, I have a sample-size experience. These are topics that I have encountered, or tips that have worked for my schools (I transferred). Not everything in this list will work for everyone, nor every school. My intention is to just help incoming students who might not be aware of the difference between writing in college and high school. (Also, admittedly and selfishly possibly save the sanity of other tutors.) 2) Writing Centers are tutors not editors. This one actually goes towards students and professors. Too many students and professors expect a student to walk into the center with a paper full of grammatical or structural errors, and we'll tell them exactly how to fix each and every error. Maybe we'll even fix it for them. No. That is not what Writing Centers do. We are tutors. We can point out errors. We can advise you have to fix them and avoid them in the future. We can even help you on the first one or two if it is a repeating error. We will not fix it for you. We will not fix it for your students. Just like how you would ask a math tutor to explain how you got something wrong and how to fix it yourself, not to look at a bunch of incorrectly solved problems and just correct each one for you with no explanation. The math tutor may correct the first one, showing you how, and ask you to correct the next one yourself with their help. Professors, just because you sent your students to us does not mean they will submit a perfect paper. Like I said, we will make suggestions. Some students never listen to our suggestions. Some students think that they are not wrong. Some students do not care and only visited the Writing Center because you required it. These are problems we cannot fix and only your student, themselves, can. 3) You always need a thesis. Too many times I have been told ""my professor didn't say that I *need* a thesis."" You do. You always need a thesis. One unfortunate reality of college is that students come from very diverse backgrounds with a variety of education. Just because all of these students have been accepted, does not mean they all had the same education. I was lucky. I went to a good high school that pounded the basics into our skulls. One of these basics were, ""you always need a thesis."" Thankfully for me, that basic was only reinforced for me once I started college. Think of it this way, I have never once heard a professor require the usage of periods at the end of each sentence (though proper grammar is a common complaint). Just like how your professor expects you to know end a sentence with a period, they expect you to know that you need a thesis. 4) While we are on the topic of grammar, here are some simple avoidances. Don't use contractions, ie: ""don't, can't, aren't, etc."" (I realize that I am ironically using contractions now, but this is not an academic paper, this is just a list of tips on an internet forum.) Just break up the word. Instead of ""don't"" write ""do not"". Don't use ""you/your/any form of second person (so basically just you/your, also yes, I am also using second person a lot throughout this, but same as with the contractions, this is a different context in which ""you"" is acceptable). Avoid first person (I, me, we're, us) too, unless it is an assignment in which you're allowed to use first person (ie: a reflection paper or a narrative). Avoid passive voice as much as possible. My boss's method of identifying passive voice is simply if you can say ""*something* was done by zombies."" (The book was read *by zombies.*) Another way is watching if the verb (ie: ""was read"") comes before the noun that did the action (ie: ""zombies""). This one is probably one of the hardest habits to break out of this list. It honestly just takes a lot of self awareness and practice. Another trick I sometimes advise my students to use is to avoid using forms of ""to be"" (is, am, are, were, etc.) Believe me, I know this one is tricky. Avoiding ""to be"" was the hardest habit for me to break (obviously, just read this) and sometimes you just cannot use ""to be."" However, attempting to avoid it as much as possible seriously helps you. Good training methods are too attempt to flip the sentence around, or omit the ""to be"" all together. (ie: Instead of ""The book was read by zombies,"" try ""Zombies read the book."") 5) I think this will be my last tip. This is the point that inspired this post. I know it's a pain in the butt, but cite your sources as you find them. Even if you do not think you will need to cite them or if you do not know if you will use the source, cite them. Do the full citation right away and put them in alphabetical order as you properly would in the final draft. Personally, I highlight my sources when I actually use them (unless I'm using Chicago style, which is rare), so then I know what I can delete off of my final draft. I know. Believe me, I know, this is a pain and seems highly unnecessary, but I have seen students get a fail because they missed or didn't properly cite *one source.* This is not meant to scare you, but rather to caution you. There have been many times that I was not entirely sure if I should (or if a student should) cite a source. It's always better to over-cite than under-cite. I would much rather have a paper littered with citations every sentence, then wonder where you got your sources from, and most professors I know feel the same. 6) Okay, I lied. This is my last one. I'll keep it short. When in doubt, ask your professor. No one knows your professor's expectations better than them",Academic,Medium,1.0,web:reddit:r/college:search:complaint,Medium,1,5803,1067,0,Tips for Incoming Freshmen (and all students) from the Writing Center.,0

"What would you think and do if a student [30/F] confessed to a criminal history. Hi everyone, I am a current postgraduate psychology student, and I am training to become a psychologist. I am looking for the perspectives of academics. I have a complex medical history, and I take multiple medications to manage my health. The university are aware of this. In 2015, the police caught me at the airport in Australia headed for the UK with opioids. I had a prescription, but it wasn't on me. They charged me with unlawful possession of a controlled substance. I went to court with a lawyer, and the charge was withdrawn. When I applied to become a provisional psychologist, my application was significantly delayed because I had to declare my medical history, incase it was considered an 'impairment'. They were not, however, concerned by my criminal history once they understood the circumstances. I am now a registered provisional psychologist. I also applied for a Working With Children Check in October last year. They wrote to me and asked me to explain the charges. They said I had no proof that I had a prescription, so they were going to reject my application, but my lawyer and I decided to hire a forensic psychiatrist. He wrote to them, and said I am no risk to children, and I sometimes take opioids to manage severe pain, but I am not addicted to opioids. We sent the report in July, and have not heard from them since. The university have forgotten about the WWCC, and have organised a placement as a provisional psychologist. I contacted my lawyer, and she said it is illegal for me to commence the placement. WWCC are not answerable to anyone, and are unwilling to provide a timeline. I think I need to tell the university, but I am nervous. I am worried they will think I am addicted to opioids. I am worried they will think I am lying about my criminal history - because, really, how are opioids related to working with children? I am also worried they will think the reason my registration took so long to process was because of my history. Ultimately, I am worried I will lose my place in the course. What are your thoughts?

"What’s the worst professor you’ve ever had? What’s the best. What did they do to make them the best or worst? **edit:** I have another HORRIBLE professor story I wanted to add in. I was taking a probability class over summer last year and also working on campus. I ended up reporting my boss for sexual harassment and my department did an investigation and found enough stuff on his PC to warrant him being immediately fired and banned from campus. The same day they fired him, he was found dead by suicide. I had a lot of issues handling this, emotionally, and the Dean of Students and campus counseling came to my aid to support me through it. I was very grateful towards them. The same week this happened, I had a midterm in my probability class. The dean personally spoke to my teacher to ask him to be mindful of my circumstances and give me extra time to prepare for the test and to take it later in the week. He refused, told me to not be lazy and to ""hire a tutor if the class is so hard for you"" and gave me a list of tutors starting off at $50/hr. I didn't need help studying, I just needed more time and considering I quit my job after what happened, I definitely didn't have $50/hr to throw at anyone anyway. I ended up getting a C+ in the class and therapy, no thanks to how much of an asshole the teacher was. I've since told all my fellow math students to not take any classes from him because he has no sympathy for students and he wasn't even a good teacher to begin with. **worst**: I took a CS - based discrete math course, and the teacher for that was the fucking worst. It was a large class (auditorium-sizes class), and so the teacher had a teaching assistant. It became pretty clear early on that she had no like or respect for students and I’m pretty sure she was only teaching because she had to, but she was more interested in her research work. She often rushed lecture, she refused to slow down for anyone that asked (and would openly mock them for asking), and she was very unforgiving with grades. As in, if a problem was a multi-parter with parts (a) to (d) and you partially got (c) incorrect, the entire problem would be marked zero. At the first midterm, she started the test by saying she put some common mathematic formulas on the back of the exams for “all the morons in the room who never bothered to learn basic math”. I left that test, reported her to the CS department, and dropped the class. **best**: On the flip side, the next semester, I took a math-based discrete math course from a strict but very fair mathematician who was very knowledgeable and had a good way to help students understand difficult concepts in more basic terms. I had to work my ass off in that class, but I learned so much and I really respect the teacher.

"Formatting academic papers is often harder than writing them. Many students are finding they have no difficulty understanding the content; however, they find themselves struggling to understand how to properly format their assignments. Many of these students’ difficulties arise from: * Citation styles (Chicago or APA). * Footnotes verses bibliography. * Margins, spacing, headings. * Long documents being split into multiple sections in Microsoft Word at the last minute prior to submitting the document. When time is limited and stress levels increase, many of our students tend to spend an excessive amount of time and energy attempting to get their formatting correct.

I want to do a masters in economics, I already had some micro, macro, finance courses at my bachelor, all of them are B+ I am thinking about the US right now but Europe is a possibilty as well. I am really overwhelmed by the amount of research I have to do. I have to research which schools are good, which schools I actually have a chance of getting in, which examinations I need to take to get in, referrals and essays, and this is making me overwhelmed. Any advice, comment, any place to start is appreciated!",Examination,Low,0.0,web:reddit:r/gradschool:new,Low,0,916,165,5,Decided to do masters- don't know where to start.,0
If you feel your grade is unfair you have the right to appeal to the dean of the department. Absences usually count just towards class participation which in most cases is 10 maybe 15 percent.

"Am I letting my fear of burning out damage my work ethic? I feel like I don't work as hard as my peers. This has been on my mind a lot recently, relating to how much I work in relation to my peers. I'm currently in the first year of my PhD in Ecology and I worry that I don't work nearly hard enough. I think it's important to mention that I have an ongoing history with mental health problems (depression, which has been very severe at times, as well as anxiety and ADHD), and these issues have of course affected my work. Probably most relevant are times when I've experienced really extreme burnout. There were some instances at the beginning of my undergrad where I pushed myself really hard, and over a few weeks or months the stress and exhaustion piled up until I totally cracked. When this would happen I would start crying uncontrollably and become a total wreck for at least a day or so, staying in bed and doing nothing productive. After that it would take me a really really long time to bounce back. At least a few weeks where I was unable to even try to work on my projects, and probably another month where I would try to work but make minimal progress because I had no motivation at all. In reaction to this, I started to really be conscious of overworking myself for the latter part of my undergrad. I would work for 6 or 7 hours a day on weekdays, always during the daylight/normal working hours if at all possible. On evenings and weekends I wouldn't work on my projects at all. I would still think about them constantly in my free time, and would frequently jot down ideas, but I wouldn't sit down and work if I could avoid it. And I think this system worked relatively well for me--in the latter two years of my undergrad I managed to secure my current PhD position with my dream PI at an Ivy and even got a first-author paper published in a good disciplinary journal (although it didn't actually come out until a couple weeks ago well into my first year of my PhD). However, now that I'm in grad school, I've been increasingly worried that this laid back ""only works on weekdays"" style is just not going to cut it. I see the peers in my cohort working wayyy more hours than I do, at least 10 hours on weekdays, plus at least 3 or 4 hours on weekends. My girlfriend is also a grad student and has a similar schedule, she works sooo much. I am incredibly impressed by them, and frankly I envy this work ethic. Recently I've been feeling that I haven't gotten enough done for my first year, and that I haven't gotten a good enough start on my projects. I managed to get my undergrad paper out, but that took almost 2.5 years from start to finish, and I don't think that pace is enough. Granted a lot of my time this year has been taken up by classes and travel for field work, but still. I want to work much harder and for much longer hours, as it seems that this is what's necessary now that I'm in the big leagues. Compared to my peers I feel totally unqualified to be here with such a laid back work ethic and such short working hours. From my cohort and my girlfriend I feel a constant pressure to work longer and harder. But I am terrified of my horrible burnout cycles from my past coming back. Does anyone have any thoughts on this? How can I work harder and keep up with my peers without risking burnout and losing productivity?",Fees,Medium,1.0,web:reddit:r/gradschool:search:exam schedule problem,Medium,1,3355,634,7,Am I letting my fear of burning out damage my work ethic?,0

I'm a junior professor asking other more senior professors for some advice! I'm a 3rd-year tenure track assistant professor in the social sciences at a good, but not great, university. I'm on track for tenure, but hoping to get a better job before closer to home. I have been publishing very well my stage (4 publications in the top two disciplinary journals) but 1) it is with senior co-authors and 2) most people do not know who I am (I am not very involved in the discipline). Next fall, I will have a semester-long leave. I'm trying to figure out how to use it best use it and was wondering if ya'll had any feedback. Options: 1) Stay where I am, and get a ton of research done. Maybe finish my solo-authored book project. Pros: Probably the simplest and most research-productive option. Cons: I will be in the bubble of my head. 2) Contact people at a top R1 I would like to work at and see if they have any fellowships or unofficial visiting programs that would allow to be on their campus over the semester, attend talks, maybe present and access their libraries. Pros: good networking; access to new ideas, environments, and data. Cons: expensive to pay two rents; maybe not possible (I know a colleague who did this visiting the University of Chicago but might not be common). 3) Work while traveling. Pros: most fun; when else would I get to do this?; creative + cultural benefit of traveling that may be indirectly applicable to my work. Cons: expensive; least productive.

"I'm ""arbitrary and unfair."". I know I'm too sensitive, but this semester has been challenging and emotionally draining. I allowed an international student to join one of my asynchronous courses, which is in my department but offered as a GE course. He asked to join the course in Week 3 with a wonderful narrative plea, and his adviser assured me he was a ""great student"" and would ""work hard"" to catch up. I gave him TWO WEEKS to catch up, and today, he emailed to tell me that my assignments and grading are ""arbitrary and unfair."" He also insulted a third-party app I use to encourage peer engagement (Perusall). Perusall ([perusall.com](https://perusall.com)) uses AI to grade the students based on parameters I set, such as quality of posts, time spent on the reading or watching a video, how much time they engage, and other options such as how many of their posts got replies. This application was WELL explained in Orientation, so I'm assuming he flew through it and never truly read it because I said I often don't agree with the automatic grading so I review each assignment before I use deep integration to pass the points awarded to Canvas - and I have 80 students.

"I cried for three days before leaving for college. I got there, said by to my parents, and never looked back. I went to school 90 miles from home and only went home over breaks. I was very happy when I lived at home but was actually happier at school. The freedom is amazing Let's break this down. * **Dorm shopping:** this can be very overwhelming. Find a list online and highlight what you actually want to buy vs superfluous stuff. Go to a store you are comfortable with and buy as much off the list as you can handle for one trip. Go back as many times as you need until you have everything. * **Don't want to leave home:** that totally makes sense. Make a plan with your parents for how often/when you'll communicate and over what medium (ex: text daily, 2 weekly phone calls, Sunday facetime). This will make the transition easier. Maybe you can even plan care packages with them so you have something to look forward to (ex: after one month, mom sends you brownies. after two months, cookies and cheez-its). Also, don't worry about being ""uncool"" for talking to your parents or getting packages. It feels awkward at first, but by october, your friends will ask to delay dinner to finish telling their parents about an exam and you'll be yelling obnoxiously in the background. Heck, senior year, my best friend would talk to his parents while we hung out * **Challenging classes:** you are ahead of a lot of people actually. A lot of people start college and underestimate the work so I'm almost happy you are stressed. Just like in high school, you'll fall into a rhythm so everything gets done. It all might take longer, but it all gets done. It might be harder, but you won't be the only one. * **Getting classes:** email the department chair about the classes you need. If no response after a week, email the registrars office. Remember, it's your freshman fall, so there is lots of time to take all the classes you need * **Honors College/Scholarship:** okay, in a few months, once college feels like home, you'll laugh at yourself for this one.

"I was given confirmation that I graduated…or so I thought. \*UPDATE: I’ve contacted the registrars office at my previous university, and here’s what happened. Before I go into detail, my credits were all met, I completed everything I needed to, my graduation application was processed and accepted, and my gpa was well above the minimum requirement. What happened was, I was transferred to two people that both told me something wasn’t adding up. I was then given contact information from someone at my specific college. This was at Penn state, and they are a university divided into “colleges” for different programs (ie. College of Science, College of Agriculture, etc.). Once I explained my situation to the person from my college, she saw that I had been withdrawn from graduation despite all of my requirements being met. I have a theory that this is because I stated to my advisor that I would not be walking at graduation. I chose not to walk because I simply did not want to. There’s more to that, but that’s not really important to this situation. What I’m assuming happened was, I was removed as someone who was graduating instead of walking. They clarified that there was nothing on my end that had to be done, since this was a mistake on the college’s end. They are in the process of fixing my graduation status, and I will officially get my diploma in the mail. Word of advice: PLEASE double check that you are officially approved to graduate if you decide not to walk at your ceremony. I would not be shocked if this was a common occurrence, nonetheless, this was very stressful and scary for myself. Thank you to those who gave insight on what could have happened and how I should go about this. — I have a bit of an odd situation. I graduated this semester. I completed all of the required classes, and even some extra courses in my major to fix my GPA. I had a rough first year, so I spent the last years of my degree taking extra courses similar to my major. I wanted to kind of “make up” for what happened in the beginning of my degree. This may sound unnecessary, but I wanted to do it for grad school applications. So, I know I have taken plenty of credits that would go towards my degree. In fact, an excessive amount. My advisor triple checked and confirmed that I was good to go, and told me I had completed my degree successfully. I then cross-checked myself using my academic requirements list and my transcript. I was on the graduation list, received an email from the alumni association, and my parents received graduation mail at my home address that I originally gave the university. These last few weeks, I had been receiving some strange emails from my school. First was an email from the bookstore telling me that my records show I haven’t purchased all of my textbooks. Weird, but I figured it was an automated email or something. Next, I receive an email updating me about financial aid requirements. Again, probably another automated email. I kept receiving these emails, and similar ones. I was still in my departments emailing list too, since they kept sending emails about program updates and events. Today, I go to retrieve my transcript from my student account. Well, I check my degree completion section because I was suspicious. It says I am still “active” in my program, instead of “graduated” or “complete”. Now here is why I am so angry and confused. My university had given me so many problems in the past. I won’t go into detail, but they have essentially made my life a living hell. So I am wondering why I am still listed as “active” and receiving emails as if I am a student. I’ve tried to call and contact them, but the university will not take calls nor answer my emails due to “high volume at the start of the spring semester”. Has anyone had this happen before?

"You have articulated something no one here can really answer: is the modern university's aim to produce good employees or good citizens? GenAI is going to bring this argument into crisis mode because we won't be doing much of either imo. Seriously, do pro-AI people not realize that anyone can push a button? Training students to use AI well is going to take about fifteen minutes to learn good prompting. I have not attended one ""teaching with AI"" workshop (and I've attended about five) that convinced me otherwise. GenAI is pretty darn easy to use---it's designed that way. We don't need legions of educators to teach a simple skill. The way pro-AI people are training students to use AI may also be completely different than how their workplace expects them to use it (especially due to privacy issues), so they aren't even preparing them for the workforce that well unless they can anticipate exactly how AI will play a role in the job. A calculator still requires someone to have the basic knowledge of math to check its output. These pro-calculator, so pro-AI, people are missing the essential problem: people are trying to sidestep learning basic composition by getting the programs to draft for them. How would these button-pushers ever learn what ""good"" composition is if they are constantly trying to jump from point A to point C. Idea --&gt; draft. Where is the human production in one of the most human of arts? There is something so fundamentally wrong about people advocating for bot writing but slapping a human name on it.

It's going to deepen the functional illiteracy we see at the college level for those who don't have basic skills.

"Experience Ending Research Collaboration. I received a small grant from a foreign organization with the condition that I collaborate on the project with a scholar from that country. I initiated all the project ideas, planning, data collection, and analysis, while the other PI made no contributions for a year. Despite attending initial meetings, the co-PI failed to communicate or participate in any meaningful way for several months. The issue arose when the co-PI's university sent me an agreement regarding the collaboration, even though the individual had not contributed anything to the project. According to the agreement, I had to share all my work with the co-PI and even further progress based on the work, which is not fair. Since I handled all aspects of the work independently and did not actually need the funds—intended only for travel or conference attendance—I consulted with my university's grants office and decided to return the funds to the organization and discontinue collaboration with that co-PI. My university's grant office advised me that I didn't have to communicate with the co-PI for this reason. So I didn't inform this. Now, after three months of no communication and not showing up for the meeting that we planned, the co-PI has reached out, asking to resume collaboration. I prefer not to respond directly to their email.

"Advice needed - passed all coursework for degree but had issues on comps due to anxiety and autism, and was dismissed from program. I am posting this for my daughter, who is a grad school student with Level 1 Autism, anxiety disorder and panic disorder. She has always excelled academically (completed her bachelor's degree in three years) and was accepted by several grad schools. Her area of study is communication science and disorders, as she wants to be a speech therapist and specifically wants to work with children with autism. All throughout K-12, I kept a 504 plan open for her; but we never needed accommodations except for one time when she was in ninth grade and was recovering from brain surgery. In that case, she needed a quieter environment for tests. I'm mentioning this because this is why she was so unfamiliar with how to request academic accommodation in grad school. Anyway, she struggled a bit in grad school with anxiety and panic attacks. This was her first time living so far away from home (her undergrad college was close enough she could come home on weekends). That plus the overall pressure - grad school's intense! - impacted her performance during her first practicum placement as she had to call in sick several times due to having debilitating panic attacks. However, she addressed this by working with her healthcare provider to increase her medication and her clinical director agreed to let her do a 4-day workweek for practicum (instead of 5 days, plus her classes). She received a grade of B- for her first practicum; her program allows a single B- (any more than that and you are dismissed). This approached worked and she earned mostly A's and one B+ on her subsequent practicum placements. Similarly, her grades in her academic courses were A's. So, she fulfilled her requirements academically. The problem is that her school requires comps to be in the form of an oral examination with a question/answer session afterwards. This is only the second year they have done this; prior to that, it was always a written exam. Students are allowed one re-test if they do not pass on the initial attempt. On her first attempt, she suffered a debilitating panic attack lasting almost an hour. She was completely unable to complete her oral presentation and was given a failing grade. They did schedule a re-test for two weeks later. She was in such a state of distress at this point that she was barely functional. I had to come stay with her for almost the whole time, she did additional sessions with her therapist, and her doctor recommended a change in medication as she was still having multiple panic attacks daily. At her re-test, she did better than the first time (i.e., she got through it) but still was so terribly distressed that she misspoke, mixed up terms, forgot things, etc. She was given a failing grade once more. At this point, I told her she needed to contact Student Disabilities and request an academic accommodation. She did so, but because she is an anxious, autistic kid she didn't push very hard at advocating for herself. However, they did not suggest any possibilities for accommodation to her. In the end, all that was done was she was allowed a third try. She was given no clear feedback on what was deficient in her prior presentation; just that she ""did not meet requirements"" for the topics on the rubric. Also, instead of allowing her to re-work her original presentation, she was told she had to research a new topic and come up with new reflections. Once again, she was in such a state of distress and panic that she had a great deal of difficulty even preparing the presentation. Additionally, she was still working 4 full time days per week at her final practicum placement (because she had been on a slightly reduced practicum schedule, she needed 10 more hours to graduate. She opted to do an additional full six-week placement because she thought the extra experience with a different population would be beneficial to her). Well.last week was her third and final try and once again she was given a failing grade. This time, they did give her some more specific feedback. Some of the items seemed really minor - saying things like ""traumatic brain injury patient"" instead of ""patient with traumatic brain injury"". And some of it was due to her forgetting things or mixing up terms, in her state of panic. She was informed she is now dismissed from the program. My take on this is that since there is a clear disconnect between her performance in her courses (all of which she passed, all A's with one B+) and her practicum clinicals and externships (all A's aside from the first assignment, which was the lone B- and she improved after that), that maybe.JUST MAYBE.the oral exam format is not appropriate for a person with autism and severe anxiety/panic disorder. I think if she truly wasn't capable academically or in practice, she would have done poorly in her classes or in her placements - and if that was the case, they should have dismissed her long ago, not waited until she spent $40K and THEN denied her the degree. So, I'm urging her to appeal the decision, and to point out that she has met all of the academic and clinical requirements of the program, and that the oral format of the test is unsuitable for accurately gauging her knowledge and expertise. I also did some research, and it turns out most master's degree programs in this area of study use a written exam or series of exams for comps, not an oral one. Also, the accrediting body (ASHA) does NOT require an oral exam - the format of the comprehensive exam is left up to the university. So there is no real reason why they couldn't accommodate her. I also think the university's failure to provide a reasonable accommodation, for a student who has otherwise done well over the past two years, constitutes a violation of the ADA and Section 504. I would be interested in hearing other peoples' experiences with appealing a dismissal.

"Long ago when I did my clinical psych internship at IUMC, there was a percentage of the billable hours that a psychologist earned, performing services on the medical campus, that was retained by the medical center. It was used to defray costs, and also generated revenue that the medical center could allocate back to intern training, etc. It was around 12%. Didn’t matter if insurance paid the psychologist or if it was out of pocket (like divorce mediation, or competency to stand trial evaluation). If you worked offsite you did not pay that fee, even if the referral came from the medical center work. Off-site indirect costs were typically 40% (you bill for $100, you keep $60, $40 goes to pay for the office, cleaning, secretary, etc).

"I am considering building an academic website builder, is that a good idea. Hello everyone, I’m in the final year of my PhD in economics, and I’m also a freelance web designer in my free time. I’ve been considering creating a personal academic website, but I’ve been disappointed by existing solutions: * WordPress is unnecessarily complex, and most templates have poor design. * Tools like Gatsby or other static site generators are great only for people who already know how to code. * I would like to have a solution like [Bento.me](http://Bento.me) but tailored for academics. As a designer/developer, I have access to many beautiful and tailored tools for design, but as a researcher, it seems that almost all the tools we use are outdated and/or poorly designed. It feels a bit frustrating. So, I’m considering building my own solution—a tool to help academics easily build a beautiful academic website. As both a researcher and a designer/developer, I think I may be one of the few people able to do it *right*. I’d love to have your genuine feedback on this idea and on the screens I’ve already designed: * Home page: [https://share.cleanshot.com/KPr2jzbD](https://share.cleanshot.com/KPr2jzbD) * About page: [https://share.cleanshot.com/6LYqf4CR](https://share.cleanshot.com/6LYqf4CR) * Research page: [https://share.cleanshot.com/1pGd6w7D](https://share.cleanshot.com/1pGd6w7D) * Editor view: [https://share.cleanshot.com/BD2qQmXw](https://share.cleanshot.com/BD2qQmXw) (Please consider the content only as placeholder.) So far, I’ve designed the entire tool (from both the visitor’s and editor’s perspectives), and I’m almost ready to start building it. But before going further, I want to make sure this is something the academic community truly needs. What if I’m the only one who wants a modern design for their website? What if I forget important features that other researchers may need? So I’d really appreciate any feedback you can give me! * Do you think having a modern website builder for academics is a useful idea? * Do you like the design and feel of the homepage, or would you prefer something different? * Would it be a problem if, at first, the tool lacks aesthetic customization (i.e., all sites look visually similar)? I could introduce templates later, but it would take more work for a side project. * Is there any feature you’d need in order to consider building your personal academic website with this tool?

"My roommate makes me feel so insecure. I feel selfish for even saying this, but I truly believe my roommate is ruining my time here at college. I love it here, and I've made so many amazing friends, but something needs to change. He'll game online late into the night, and keep me awake, literally screaming to his friends on discord. I can't study or do homework in my room, because of the noise. I've asked him to please be quieter several times, but if anything he's only gotten louder. On top of this, I already have problems studying, so I'm lucky if I can go for a few hours without getting distracted or sidetracked. I came to college as an honors student, and I already had my associate degree in highschool, but now I'm failing exams, skipping class, and getting behind on everything. Most (if not all, let's be real) of this is my fault, but some of it is linked to me just not feeling comfortable in my dorm. Not only does he always make random, loud noises while gaming (like six hours a day), but he also happens to be a perfect student. He never studies, and grasps content immediately, then pisses the rest of his time away, before getting perfect marks on exams and quizzes. We're the same major, so right now we're in some of the same classes, and he always makes a big deal of telling me his score on big assignments, before asking me how I did. I never give him actual numbers (because I don't feel comfortable doing so), and hearing about how perfect he is has become so grating. Last semester I failed a class, while he had a 99, and all he would talk about after tests was how ""fucking stupid"" someone would have to be to fail, and of course I was one of those people most of the time. It's gotten to the point that I hate seeing him, and actively hide/leave the room when I know he'll be in it. I don't want to be honest about my issues because I know he would just tell everyone we know that I'm struggling. I can't trust him with any secrets.

"False accusation based on Feeling can I do anything. I’m in an unpleasant situation at school. I’m studying ICT (first year) and I only have one week left. I’ve almost completed all 60 study points. I only need 12 more, and that’s for one project. We’ve had several reviews where we had to explain where certain user stories were located. I answer those questions well, and my classmates often know them too. Sometimes there are things none of us know, and that’s normal. Today, I made an extra effort. In today review I spoke up more, and when a classmate didn’t know the answer to a question, I gave the correct one. I was also able to clearly explain the part I had to present. At the end of the lesson, the teacher said that if we do well on the final assessment, we won’t need an individual evaluation. A classmate asked about this, and the teacher then said, “Your group will definitely pass… except my name.” So me very personal. And he said it in a mean way. Afterwards, I went up to the teacher and asked why he said that. I asked, “Which questions didn’t I know, that my group members did?” He then said, “I don’t know, it’s just my feeling.” But that can’t be right, can it? You can’t assess someone based on a ‘feeling’ — there should be concrete reasons for that. I found it very unfair that he’s already saying I won’t pass, even though the final assessment hasn’t even taken place yet. Why is he so focused on me? I’m really angry about it. He also said, “On Tuesday, you have to do the most of the assessment on your own, your group won’t have to talk to much. I found that really strange. But okay, I’m preparing well now. But imagine I do well, and they still fail me. I always have good grades. I feel really stressed. I feel powerless. I will do my best for upcoming end assessment to show him.

"Are there professors who prioritize research over admin work. Firstly, please don't come for me. I am mostly ranting. On a random day in October 2024, my professor sent me a LaTex template for a journal submission. They wanted me to write a paper, and as the student it is in my best interest to comply, and so I did. It got to the point that I have made so many sacrifices just to finish it -- whether it be coursework, sleep, or some other thing. I finished the write-up sometime December and sent it to them, only for the manuscript to remain unread in their table until today. Talking to some of my peers, I also came to know that other people experience the same thing with other professors. I don't know, but there is an implicit expectation within me that the professor will provide timely, constructive feedback. I understand professors have admin or teaching duties, multiple students to manage -- but in the same way I have made sacrifices to finish the paper, maybe the reason why this feels unfair is that I expect some form of sacrifice on their part? Scratch that, this is unrealistic and will never happen, but now I understand the power dynamic between a professor and student goes much deeper. I have 0 power in forcing them to read the manuscript the same way they had power to make me write it. I asked for a 1-on-1 meeting last month to go over the manuscript, only to find out during the meeting they only read until the introduction. At that rate, I expect the submission to happen maybe this year's Christmas or the following. There's only so many follow-ups I can do lest I am deemed impatient, inconsiderate, or demanding. I am not saying professors are apathetic, but it's sad they get drowned in admin work. In an ideal world, my professor would have read my manuscript much sooner. I'll just take this as a learning experience, that there are a lot of things in academia far beyond your control. Whether this is normal or not is beyond me, but what I do know is I feel defeated. Sooner or later there will be new papers that will get published that will eventually drain the novelty of my work. This does not tell much on my capability to do research nor dictate my command over the field, but in a system that gauges merit with tangible outputs, without publications I then cannot compete. I learned now success as a scientist also entails navigating institutional inertia well enough you don't get lost in this labyrinth. Maybe it's irony, maybe it's not.

"Suspended studies after second year due to parental bereavement. Hi there thanks for reading. I study computer science, I've decided to suspend my studies after second year from parental bereavement. I lost my dad in July due to stomach illness. I wanted to take some time out from my studies. My university were fine with it and just needed his death certificate on file as evidence. Since this I've had a time to reflect and think about things.

"Confused after bittersweet PhD. I am finishing my PhD (non-EU student in an EU PhD). In fact I have my defense in a few weeks. For context my PhD is in theoretical computer science but my background is in pure mathematics. My experience wasn't the best but neither was it the worst. On the bright side I was able to try new hobbies live in new places and meet lots of new and interesting people inside and ouside academia. On the bad side, the relationship with my supervisor was not the best. While he did a great job organizing what publications I should focus on, I felt that I was just doing grunt work for him. Whenever I tried to talk to him about some idea he either told me to do so later or that the idea was useless from the get go. In most of the papers I had no participation in the research meetings but I was supposed to write the papers as if I had been there. Sometimes the feedback I was was super useful but other times I was rudely critizised. For example whenever I struggled to understand something new I was met with a ""You figure it out. It is your PhD"" but if I tried to understand things my own way (using analogies from my maths background) I got told that it was too abstract or that it was useless and I shouldn't be doing it that way. But when I asked him what way he recommended, he said he shouldn't have to tell me as I am supposed to be an independent researcher. Sometimes I tried completely new things to which he gave feedback such as ""Terrible"" without any question or guidance on how to make things better. After this consistent rude feedback, I stopped trying. As I am a non-EU citizen, I was afraid of any formal complaint given that my residence permit is tied to the PhD. As I noticed how I was learning from the good pieces of feedback, I decided not to quit. Instead I opted for counseling and it got me through the PhD. The most tiring part of this process was how inconsistent the outcome of my supervisor meetings was. After the thesis submission, I had the chance to talk with other professors (here and abroad) about my ideas. Some of them liked them and even encouraged me to apply for funding to pursue them. I told my supervisor about that and he has agreed to support my application. I have also written some results on my own but not published them. Other colleagues have said the results could be publishable, provided I can organise them into a coherent story and add one extra application/example. I have been struggling on this last part on my own. Given that my contract expires soon, I wonder how much effort I should invest in writing a solo paper. After the PhD, I will take a month for myself following the counselor's advice. At the moment, I feel overly thankful for the amount of support I have gotten by other professors to pursue my own ideas. After 3 years of feeling that I could only come with useless ideas I feel motivated. However, considering all the randomness that comes with academic life, I am still on the fence whether to continue in academia or not. Having all that context, I want to ask the following things: 1. The personality mismatch was not only with my supervisor but also with some of the other senior collaborators. Sadly, I also got rude feedback from them. Instead, the postdocs I worked with were super helpful and have been encouraging me to publish something on my own. I have one of them as a reference for my application as he got tenure last year. How difficult it is to start your own network of collaborators outside your supervisor's network? 2. What do you recommend doing with the backlog after the PhD? Would a solo preprint be helpful? 3. For those who were on the fence about continuing in academia or doing something else, how did the answer come to you? 4. Reading scientific papers is something I really enjoy. Especially when I see connections across disciplines. Are there jobs outside academia where one is engouraged to read papers and apply their results? 5.

"Recently accepted to graduate school and having second thoughts. Advice would be appreciated. A little background information on me : I'm a non-traditional student that came back to college at the age of 22. Initially I was on the medicine track but switched over to research about a year and a half ago after really enjoying the critical thinking and having a knack for it. Some issues I had with medical school as well were: incurring large amounts of debt, loss of interpersonal relationships, and the fear of not being accepted by other med students due to having a different background than what is typical. That being said, I still wanted to be involved in clinical medicine as a researcher and applied to certain universities that had programs that fit my interests. I was recently accepted to a mid ranked R1 research institution biology program with 27k stipend, health insurance, and full tuition waver - which is great! The problem is this: while waiting over the last month to hear from them, I had alot of time to think and it has affected my views of graduate school greatly. Before my interview I was very excited that a university would pay money to fly me out there to interview, let alone potentially accept me. One issue is a specialized program available at that university that will be losing funding and may not exist when I attend ( My application was built around this program to some extent). It seems that this was on the hush-hush, as I was only able to find it out from the program director himself - the admissions committee members seem to be in the dark about it. The program would've incorporated translational medicine into my curriculum and clinical rounds to supplement my thesis. **It is difficult to see myself as a researcher not working with patients on a consistent basis - my career/life would not be as fulfilling if I was only doing basic lab research (personal opinion).** When I arrived back I decided to apply to some entry level hospital/clinical positions in order to gain some further experience in the medical field (My concentration was pre-med and I've been a volunteer firefighter for a couple years, as well as EMT-B certified). Surprisingly (to me), I have not heard back from any of my potential employers. While I know my work experience has been limited due to focusing on my studies for the past 4 years, I really would've thought my degree/certifications would count for something. My self-esteem has really taken a hit because I feel like if my bachelor's degree is useless for job prospects - **would a PhD become an extension of this? Could I do 6 more years of not ""working"" for a total of a decade of being ""technically"" unemployed?** I also feel that reading the negative experiences so many have had has also affected my views on graduate school. I've begun to wonder if I should return to my original track and go for a professional degree like MD or DO - degrees that also allow me to perform research too. When I was applying to graduate school I was very resolved in my decision, however now I feel like I lack the self-confidence to make it through ( I haven't even started!). While I would like others' opinions, it seems that the best decision is to just pass on the acceptance to another interviewee who is more likely to succeed than I am. **TL;DR:** Several major issues are barring me from accepting a great offer and attending a well-regarded program: work experience or lack there of while getting a PhD, being able to work with patients in biomedical research, and frequent negative anecdotes of graduate school in general. Was resolved in my decision to choose graduate school over medical school and now am on the fence. **Has anyone had similar experiences or had to make a difficult decision like this?** Sorry for the long post and I appreciate any advice",Fees,Medium,1.0,web:reddit:r/gradschool:search:attendance issue,Medium,1,3841,671,7,Recently accepted to graduate school and having second thoughts.,0

"How the f*ck do you study. Freshman at a SLAC, was a full-time slacker in high school and spent all my time playing harpsichord instead of studying. Was able to graduate with a 3.8 GPA by skimming the textbook the night before the test and occasionally handing in some homework. In short, I thought I was a god because I never really tried. This is coming back to bite me in the ass. I have zero idea how to study. I have ADHD and have been off my meds for a few months now, for a variety of reasons. I know that as soon as I get back on them a lot of issues will fix themselves, but until then I need a solution. I think I'm doing all the right things but I'm still getting Bs and Cs. What I've been doing: \- preview the textbook chapter before lecture; the depth of the preview depends on my mood. If math, do some problems before class. \- go through the readings/practice problems at least 2x, if not 3x before the exam. \- try to start projects early, most of the time I end up sacrificing weekends and sleep tho Issues I've noticed: \- can't find the time to study. This seems so stupid because I spend all my time at school, but between going to classes, eating, doing chores, recovering from the time I spend in classes, and hanging out with a friend once in a blue moon, I can't find time to study. By the time I've done all the basic survival things, I'm ready to keel over and sleep. \- I can't find a study group. How can I? I don't have any friends, and everyone has a different schedule than me. I also have no idea what people do during a study group. \- can't focus. This is obviously caused by the ADHD, but would also appreciate tips. \- I have no idea how to study for a liberal arts class.

"I’m not sure there has been a massive change in my department, but there are some smaller things. I know many people cite faculty not being in their offices as much as a change, but this condition predated the pandemic for my department since most of us have research labs that aren’t close to our academic offices. To me, the more noticeable and durable changes are: (1) students now expect professors to distribute lecture notes/slides. Previously students would like it when you did it, but they didn’t necessarily seem to expect it. (2) greater comfort with virtual meetings. This is both good and bad. Some meetings are better when held virtually, but others are worse. It’s great when people figure out which is which. Anecdotally, I think there has been a modest decrease in class attendance, but not a massive drop (had maybe 70% attendance before and 60-70% now). Perhaps it is worse in other types of courses (I teach exclusively in-major classes and predominantly grad level). I haven’t noticed a corresponding drop in student performance, so it’s probably that some students realized they can perform about as well without attending as regularly.

"I would suggest honestly delaying starting college until you're an in-state resident and also really looking into the different colleges around you. Even if that means you need to move to a new area. Some states it's only six months needed for residency.

I value college a ton in my life, but I personally don't see the point of getting into $100k worth of debt for it. Especially if your major isn't in demand and you might not find work for six months or more. In tandem with waiting until you have residency, some scholarships can only be awarded for those who have it.

Can I take classes without a degree in mind. you can absolutely do this. most schools let you enroll as a non-degree seeking student and just take classes that interest you. the credits will be on a transcript and usually transfer if you decide to pursue a degree later. i'd check with the admissions office at your local community college especially - they're usually set up for this and the cost is way lower. one class per semester is totally doable with a little one at home and keeps you moving forward without the pressure of picking a major right now,Certificate & Records,Medium,1.0,web:reddit:r/college:comments,Medium,1,557,101,3,Can I take classes without a degree in mind.,0

"Struggling with transition back into master's program after withdrawing due to several issues. I was in a master's program and withdrew partway through my second year. I had a supervisor who was unreliable and extremely hands-off with me, in addition to a bunch of personal issues at home, and dealing with undiagnosed ADHD. I have since then gotten an official diagnosis and have been trying to get my supervisor and program department on board to provide some assistance, so that I could transition back into my program. However, it has been a difficult process trying to get ahold of everyone. It's super frustrating because it feels like now that I have a better understanding of my situation, I am in a position where I am considered a low priority to teaching staff members. To complicate things, my university account is expiring next week, which means I will lose online library resource access if my program department does not put in a request to extend my access. So far my request has been rejected, despite providing diagnosis documentation and having a lengthy email chain with all the involved parties. I'm in a sticky situation where I need to have my thesis proposal completed in order to not get kicked out if I re-enrol into my program. Basically my supervisor needs to approve it before I am allowed to enrol. At the time of withdrawing, I was unable to meet my degree milestones on time, so I was at risk of being kicked out. So I am currently trying to work on my proposal, but it feels like I am left to figure everything out on my own, since communication with my supervisor is now restricted and my building access privilege is cut off, so I can't interact with my peers directly anymore. It feels extremely isolating and discouraging. I feel like grad school is designed for people to operate in a very specific and restrictive way, which does not align with my specific learning needs. I'm awful at self-motivation and time management. I don't understand how people can be so disciplined with waking up early and doing all their readings every single day. I struggle to follow even a basic routine and most days I feel like I'm doing the bare minimum to survive, let alone work on my thesis. I know I have the level of intellect to handle grad school, but the way I'm expected to go about things makes me feel like I'm slow and stupid. I wish I could have a mentor to provide at least some sort of weekly 15-20 minutes guidance so that I can stay accountable and have some structure to my routine. I don't know how to express the issues I'm having to my department because honestly it feels like my needs are being purposely ignored and undermined. I'm trying to advocate for my needs and have involved the university's accessibility services. I think I will need to escalate this to an ombudsperson. Anyone have similar issues? Any tips on how to manage ADHD in grad school?

"The way I look at it is the college pays ME to be there, and so I am. I have lectured in hybrid classes in an empty room and fume because after struggling through a snowstorm, I feel like I could have recorded at home. But I joke that I can still laugh at my own jokes! For students, it's more akin to paying for a gym membership now and not going. I have found that they tend to show up for the first class and maybe the first week. For some it helps if I literally write out what their tuition and fees pay for and what it costs them for every day they miss. There is a massive drop after midterms anyway. If you do not have an attendance policy with penalties, that could encourage absenteeism too. I don't give points for attendance - I'd rather they not be there than be forced to be there and then sit mesmerized by their phones or sulking anyway. I give participation points gauged by 5-minute essays at the end of the class or surprise quizzes, and of course, you have to be there for those. But it's not your job to be entertaining.

So I'm working on my MFA in fine arts and I'm at a school that I don't feel is a right fit. I'm a first year in my second semester and the program is 3 years. I'm wanting to withdraw, take a little time to myself (to help work on my mental health and my burnout), make some art for a new portfolio, and then find a different program to apply to.

Traditionally, I have a half day on Monday, Wednesday or Friday (just depends on the week), and then full days Tuesday and Thursday (sometimes Wednesdays). for my assistantship, my course itself is relatively light grading wise but i also am a TA for an instructor but we have a set weekly schedule of what is expected of me. i get up early for classes so if i have a full-day on campus, i get home, eat, watch a movie with my partner and go to bed. if it’s a half day, i will typically work on my own homework but im usually good about completing it all while on campus. i try to make my home removed from schoolwork as much as i can, sometimes that’s not possible but it’s a boundary i try to hold as much as i can. i do also work a job outside of my assistantship but i work like 5 hours a week there. my weekends are for me, i rarely work on the weekends but that means im working hard during the week. BUT that was not the case last semester during phd applications. so it varies per semester and what kind of courses you have! if you want more in depth since i am in non-clinical psych, i am happy to share more just dm me!",Faculty,Medium,1.0,web:reddit:r/gradschool:comments,Medium,1,2044,391,6,What does a day/week look like for a master’s student.,0
"Average exam grades for survey (large) introductory classes. I'm having a lot of pushback from students. I teach 3 sections of large (\~200 each) introductory courses. Pre-pandemic the average exam grades were 70-75%, with 1/3 of the class failing (department wide - this was when I started in 2006-2010). Pandemic and up until this semester I did online exams. The average there was 92%, and they absolutely did not know the material. Attendance for my class is roughly 25% on a good day. They have access to all material (slides, textbook, guided homework - most don't use it). I did in-person exams this semester. Class average is 70-71%. I am getting angry responses as that grade is much too low, how can anyone be passing, etc. These are scantron exams and I can weed out questions where most students miss, etc. What are your average exam grades for your classes? What is ""acceptable"" vs. curving territory? I have multiple 100% exam scores as well - and my exams have not increased in difficulty; if anything, I have made them slightly easier.

"What to bring with you to your dorm. There was a request in the megathread to make a new megathread dedicated to stuff to bring with you to college in hopes to cut down on the amount of people asking this question. We hope this will helpful for incoming freshman. If I miss anything on the list please comment down below so I can edit it in. If its received well I'll also consider putting it in the sidebar as a resource for future freshman that come to the subreddit in upcoming years. Remember that your dorm room will probably be smaller than your room at home. Don't bring too much stuff- especially too many clothes. **Essential Items To Bring** * Personal Items- Student ID, Government Issued ID, some spending money or a debit/credit card, anything else you might need in order to secure employment on/off campus. * Bed Sheets * Pillows + Pillow Cases * Comforter + Blankets * Laundry Basket * Laundry Items (Detergent, Fabric Softener, Tide Pods, Whatever you use at home) * Clothes Hangers * Deodorant/antiperspirant * Any Medication you take at home * Cold Medicine + Cough Drops. Sickness spreads fast in dorms. * Tissues * Napkins * Umbrella + Clothing appropriate for rain/light snow * Shower caddy * Flip flops for the shower * Shampoo/Conditioner/Body Wash/Anything else you use in the shower * At least 2 towels * Toothbrush + Toothpaste. I've actually seen people forget this. * Anything else you usually use in the bathroom at home- floss, facial moisturizer, cotton swabs, hair dryer, etc * Shaving products * Enough clothes. Don't bring your whole wardrobe but also don't bring so little that you have to do laundry every few days. I pack about 15 shirts, a couple pairs of pants, 15ish pairs of underwear and socks, and a few sweaters. * Formal Clothing. If you have a full suit consider bringing it. I bring a few dress shirts for interviews. You want to make sure you bring something other than just tshirts and jeans in case something comes up where you need to dress more formally. * A general first aid kit. At least have a few bandaids and antibiotic cream in case of minor injury * Trash Bags. Trash bins are usually provided and you don't have to bring your own. * Water Bottle * Cleaning supplies to keep your room somewhat clean * Plastic forks/spoons/knives as well as bowls, plates, and cups. * Batteries if you use anything that requires batteries. * Extension cord. * Food. Stuff like Ramen you can keep in your room for a while without it going bad * Storage Bins or Boxes **School Supplies** * Pens and Pencils + Eraser. * Pencil Sharpener if bringing non-mechanical pencils * Notebooks/Binders/Paper * Folders * Backpack * Laptop or some form of computer. * Graphing Calculator * Stuff for taking Notes. Highlighters/Index Cards/Post-it Notes. Only bring if you think you'll use it. **Non-Essential Items that are useful or may come in handy** * A fan * Headphones to block out noise * Stamps/Envelopes in case you have to mail something * A microwave and fridge (Check regulations for your school) * TV/Monitor + Possible Gaming Consoles * Coffee Maker * Electric Kettle * Posters/Wall Decorations * Rug * A toolkit * Flashlight * Iron * Kitchen products like pots/pans if you think you might cook once in a while instead of eat in the dining halls. * A shoe rack * A safe/footlocker if you wish to lock up valuables. * Door Decorations- some people really like the mini-whiteboard * Lint Brush * Condoms. RA's usually hand out free ones but I prefer bringing my own. * Tape * Scissors * Paper Clips/Stapler * Lamps * Bike/Skateboard. Be sure to bring a bike lock if you bring your bike. * Melatonin * Mattress Pad * A picture frame with something to remind you of home **What Not to Bring With You** * Printer. Printers are available in the library and some universities, like mine, give a certain amount of free prints. I never use them up in a semester. Also people will hate you if you have a wifi printer. * Winter Clothing. Bring a hoodie or light jacket with you on move in day- but don't bring the heavy winter gear right away. Pick it up over thanksgiving break or visit home and bring it back with you. Only exception being if you're an international student or out of state student and won't be returning home until winter break. * Textbooks. If you are bringing textbooks with you on move-in day then you are making a classic freshman mistake. Textbooks are never required on the first day of class. Attend class first to see if its really going to be needed. And never buy full price. Free pdfs of textbooks are out there on the internet. If you're looking for a legal alternative- renting from sites like amazon is almost always way cheaper than buying a brand new textbook. * A chair. Unless you're 100% sure housing doesn't provide any- your chair will probably be sitting under your bed for the entire semester. * Stuff your roommate will be bringing. Reach out to your roommate and coordinate who brings what. You don't want to waste space by having two people bring the same item that you guys can just share. * Stuff your college provides. Some colleges provide, for instance, fridges and microwaves to their students living in dorms. If this is the case- don't bring your own. Check to see what is already provided to you. * Your highschool relationship. Especially if its gonna be long distance once you move into college. Consider if its really worth it. It usually doesn't work out and those long skype calls can prevent you from meeting other people in the beginning weeks of dorm life. Trust me- my relationship from highschool ended rather quickly once college started. * Banned Items. Check with housing to see what's allowed and what's not. I love the smell of candles but unfortunately they're just not allowed in my dorm or many dorms across the country. You don't want to bring something that could get you in trouble. Leave any suggestions and feedback down below. If you have any questions pertaining items not on the list feel free to ask below and someone will get back to you. There are lots of items that are acceptable to bring to college but I couldn't put every possible item on the list. Use this as a general guideline. If you use something every single day at home but its not on my list- don't automatically assume you have to leave it at home.

"Just one class. I found out today from my HR department that I can advance in rank (with an extra $5000 a year) if I take ONE additional graduate history class over what my MA in history required. I also have an additional master’s degree in library science, but history is the teaching field so it’s where I could qualify for this advancement in rank. I need to get this done by August to get the raise for the 26/27 year… So does anyone have any experience with the online options in history? I LOVED my MA program but unfortunately they don’t have any online offerings. Preferably I won’t have to take the GRE since, again, I already have two masters degrees.

How to use AI in the classroom is up to the teacher and no one else. In my opinion, AI is to writing what computer algebra systems have been to mathematics for decades. They might be very useful in upper-division graduate school or upper-division undergraduate courses. However, before then, students just don't have the expertise to know if what the AI gives them is right or wrong or good or bad. K-12 could maybe use AI, as it exist right now, as a study aid at most. Then only very sparingly. Right now students will just use it to cheat.

"Professor switched grades suddenly at end of semester. Throughout the semester our professor posted curved grades for every exam. For example my first exam was a 48/100 which after the curve ended up giving me a B- then I got a 68/100 on the next exam which raised my course grade to a B after curving. Now that we took the final he completely changed his grading curve with no notice and we only found out our grades on the very last day grades were required to be posted. My final grade in the class before curving was a 73/100 but that gave me a B after curving. I think it’s really unfair that he all of a sudden switches the way he curves and it’s totally unexpected. To add to this, this professor is extremely rude and condescending (he would belittle people who ask questions in class, hasn’t responded to a single of my emails all semester). Many people in the class feel like our grades were unfair and agree with most of what I’m saying about him as a person. What should I do?

"Your story &gt; Your Stats. I posted this on r/chanceme, but I figure everyone can benefit from a reminder that they're more than just their stats. I enjoy r/chanceme. It’s comforting to post your stats and get quick feedback. I’ve seen some really thoughtful, quirky, and charmingly self-deprecating posts. But here’s the issue: most of the time, the real question being asked is, *“Do my numbers make me good enough?”* And that’s not how college admissions works—especially not at selective schools. The strongest applicants aren’t just checking boxes. They’re telling a story. They know how to show who they are, what they value, and how they’ve grown—across their essays, activities, and letters of recommendation. Admissions officers aren’t choosing stats. They’re building a class. They want real people with direction and purpose—people they can imagine thriving on campus (and, ideally, donating a building or two down the line). So instead of just asking “What are my chances?”, try asking: * What story is my application telling? * What do my choices say about who I am? * What qualities have I shown through what I’ve done?

"being an international sucks. please forgive me if this whole things comes across as whiny, i just don't have anyone to talk to about this. i come from honduras, a small country in central america most people don't care about. which is fine, by the way; i'm proud of my country and identity despite its obvious flaws. still, even from a young age i had decided that i wanted to study somewhere else. mostly to try and do something unique with my life. and i know i could: i've always had good grades, a strong work ethic, and the kind of behavior that would make teachers tell me i'm a delight of a student to have. though i wouldn't exactly call us poor, seeing as poverty is a huge issue in my country and we've been blessed enough to live without many complaints, both my mom's and dad's side of the family have struggled financially in some way or another. still, we're stable. my dad, however, is the standout; he has this whole rags to riches story that i really admire him for. thanks to him, i'm able to attend one of the top schools of the capital. i'm a junior in high school. like i said, i have good grades and high ambitions. because of this, i've become the defacto 'genius' of the family. i don't know how to feel about that title, to be honest. i'm flattered, obviously, and i know i couldn't perform the way i have done up until now without my family's thorough support, but i don't feel like deserve to be called that. at least, i won't deserve it in the future if i don't manage to study abroad. even if i do well in school, there still much better students than me. i don't have strong extracurriculars. i'm not exteoverted enough to form a club of my own or become some sort of leader figure in the classroom. i know schools might be more understanding with my class given the pandemic, and holistic applications might be my saving grace; if i don't have time to add more stuff to my excs, my SAT scores (which i'm also working on lol) and my essays might help. still, i don't have enough high hopes to apply to T20s like most people on this sub. i'be been interested in going back to california, ever since i went there back in summer of 2019. i have a google sheets document tracking my favorite schools, and most of them are from that area. my favorite one, however, is USFCA. the student body is small but brimming with diversity, and i already meet most of their requirements. there's only one problem: tuition costs. international students can only receive merit scholarships of up to 16k. which is better than nothing against a standard 52k cost, i guess. but 36k dollars is 200k away from being a million in my country's currency (not including additional costs like housing, btw!) to add insult to injury, internationals are prohibited from applying for financial aid. this has honestly crushed me. i still plan on applying, and i know my parents would want to help out in a heartbeat, but it's just too much. i really did think this was the one, after encountering so many schools that don't offer merit scholarships at all or are need-aware. i know international students are supposed to go above and beyond to prove that they belong in these schools, but it's honestly pretty disappointing to find out the system actively works against those that weren't fortunate enough to be born with a silver spoon. i know that's the way things are supposed to be: life isn't fair. it still hurts though, lol. i just want to make my family proud by doing something they weren't able to do: make a name for myself. i'm still researching more schools and working towards improvement, and maybe i'll get lucky eventually! who knows. i just need to keep pushing forward, even if giving up seems tempting. i just needed to articulate what i was feeling lol",Faculty,Medium,1.0,web:pullpush:r/ApplyingToCollege:submission:complaint,Medium,1,3772,685,6,being an international sucks.,0

I haven't seen sec(x)\^2 in literal weeks in the course, and I forgot that it was the derivative of tan(x). There was also another problem where I would have needed to have memorized the unit circle, as he wanted an exact answer instead of decimals.

"Can I hire an attorney against my college for delaying my graduation multiple times, at no fault of my own. Hi, I've been attending classes at a community college for a little over two and a half years now, attempting to obtain my Associate's Degree in Information Technology (AS). I've maintained a perfect 4.00 GPA, until this past semester. I've been taking classes full-time, starting off with doing four classes every eight weeks (this college offers eight week period classes instead of semesters, don't ask me why because I don't know), and eventually moving to two classes every eight weeks, and its been hell on earth for many reasons that make me despise this college, but aren't illegal, or anything that I feel like I could bring to a judge. About a year ago, I was in contact with my college advisor to register for my second year of classes. For one reason or another, I was unable to sign up for my classes. Typically, my advisor registered me for classes on her end, and I didn't have to worry about anything, but something went wrong this time. I typically get reminder emails for classes starting within the next two weeks, but when I didn't get any, I went to check on the website, and saw that I was 'pre-registered', but wasn't fully enrolled in my next eight weeks of classes. No problem, I go ahead and enroll, there's still spots available, but when I go in to check the next day, it seemed like I was unenrolled since the last time I looked. I had to schedule an advising appointment with my advisor, but the next earliest availability to speak with her was over a month from that point. I called the front office of my college, who basically just told me to go to hell, and I contacted Student Resources, who confirmed that my Financial Aid was still valid, and they were unsure why I was not able to enroll in classes. When I *do* finally get a hold of my advisor, she's all apologetic and so on and so forth and blah blah blah, but she says that the only way that I can graduate at the expected date, was to switch my course catalog from 2022, to 2023, and add on a few additional classes. Didn't really have a choice, so I went along with it. Well anyway, I was *supposed* to graduate next week, but when I applied for graduation three weeks ago, I got an email back the next day, stating that I wasn't allowed to graduate, and that I needed to set up an appointment with my advisor. So I do so, and fortunately, since it wasn't during a class break or anything, I was able to set an appointment for two days from that day. So I set one up by phone for 1:30pm two days from then, as I work full-time, and lately have even been working 60-65 hours per week. And she never calls. I check my phone, my emails, my texts, my voicemails, and there's no attempt to reach out to me. I wait an entire day, and when the next morning rolls around and *nobody* from the college attempted to reach out to me, I ended up emailing and calling the President of the college. The day after that (Saturday at this point), the Vice President personally called me. She said that she didn't have an answer for me yet, but was working on getting one for me, and would let me know something by Monday. So I say thank you, and hang up. When Monday rolls around, she calls me and lets me know that even though my course was changed, and I took on additional classes, I STILL had one class that I had to take, and as a result, my graduation would be delayed ANYWAY. At this point I just wanted to cuss her out, hang up, and drop out. I didn't, and after she confirmed that they wouldn't be able to waive the course, I just accepted that I would have to take one more course over the summer. **If I accepted this, why do I want to get an attorney anyway?** Well, this previous eight-week period, I had two classes. One was my Capstone project, and the other was a Security Administration class. Because the Capstone is the hardest thing I've ever done, and most of my teammates never did any work at best, and never even checked in at worst, I was doing the vast majority of the work. As a result, I could only work on my Security Administration class on Sundays. This wasn't an issue, since the assignments were due on Sundays, but when the last week came around, the final assessment and exam were due on FRIDAY. Which NOBODY had told me about. I had spent my entire Friday night working on the final project for my Capstone, and was up until around 4AM working on it, because this was also due on Friday (but Capstone projects were always due on Friday, so I was prepared for that). I go to do my final assessment and exam on Sunday, and my high A, was dropped to a low C, and I had a 0 on all three of the finals (I think one was just a reading assignment thing, but I know one was a Final Assessment, and a Final Exam). I email the professor immediately, who gets back to me that day (on a Sunday, bless this man), but he tells me that there is nothing that he can do. He says that he doesn't even know who I could reach out to. So, I email the President of the college *again.* I finally heard back from somebody this morning, who is the Dean of Business and IT, and basically told me to go screw myself. The thing is, they don't even have to GRADE these assignments and exams. The grades are automatically calculated at the end of the assessment and exam. All they have to do is look at a screenshot I send them of my grade, and go ""ah yes, this is a 15%"", or whatever I get on the finals. I've already accepted that they're just not going to do anything about my final grade, but I'm out for petty revenge, because this has ruined my scholarship chances at the college I wanted to go to when I graduated from community college, and I do not have the money for a Bachelor's Degree, as I just got off of the streets just a little over three years ago, and am still basically living paycheck to paycheck.

"[Question] Fair pay and intellectual property rights for asynchronous online courses. Hello! This is a question for academics and adjunct instructors. I am a consultant and educator, running an agency that sells work for hire and innovation classes. I sometimes teach and guest lecture for universities. I was invited to develop a course for a large private American university. The course is part of an online asynchronous certification program marketed to business professionals. The university staff have already determined the: classes in the certification and the desired learning outcomes for the course. I would develop the syllabus, all the course materials, and record a series of videos (university pays for production of the videos). Normally this sounds like a good opportunity with the exception of two concerns and I’d like to see if anyone has any experience with these. 1. I was offered a flat fee of $3,000 to do this work. My materials will be used in perpetuity. Gleaning from similar offerings, they will probably sell this certificate for about $10,000 per person (if not more). I would receive no royalties on the extended use of my work. It doesn’t feel very equitable or just that I am receiving such a low sum for the exponential money they would make off my work. 2. There is a work for hire and non-compete clause and the school is not clarifying the details of it. This would give them full ownership of the work I create for this course. They, rightfully so, want to prevent me from taking this to a competing school. I would not do that anyway, which is unethical. BUT a lot of my material and intellectual property comes from work that I have always been doing. I also sell online classes on similar topics and they are a big part of my future business model. I will be independently selling similar classes to the one I’d be developing (not connected to any other university). Again, I wouldn’t simply copy the lectures and materials directly, but there would be some overlap. I’m concerned they can sue me if I do this, but the school is not clarifying the nuances of this clause, so I can’t tell if doing this work would prevent me from doing my primary bread and butter work in the future. I can’t help but feel like these terms take advantage of instructors and create a lot of inequity.

Petition for Cancellation and Re-Conduct of CBSE Class 10 Mathematics Examination (17 February) We, the students and concerned parents, respectfully submit this petition regarding the CBSE Class 10 Mathematics examination conducted on 17 February. We believe that the examination did not maintain uniformity and fairness for the following reasons: The difficulty level was significantly higher than the pattern indicated by official sample papers and previous year papers. Certain high-weightage questions appeared beyond the expected scope of the prescribed syllabus and blueprint. There was a noticeable difference in difficulty level across Set 1, Set 2, and Set 3. As per CBSE norms, question sets should be equivalent in difficulty, with only the order of questions varied. Students who had prepared sincerely according to the syllabus were unable to attempt several questions due to unexpected framing and complexity. Board examinations play a crucial role in shaping academic records. Therefore, fairness and uniformity are essential. In the interest of justice and equality for all students, we respectfully request: Immediate review of all question sets by an independent academic panel. Cancellation of the 17 February Mathematics examination. Re-conduct of the examination with a fair and syllabus-aligned paper for all students.

Paramedic can normally done one of two ways: you can pursue it with the minimum number of courses to certify, which includes a college level Anatomy and Physiology course, *or* some people go ahead and get it as an Associate's, which I am presuming just comes with a few extra electives since the regular course is already about 1,000 hours of class and clinicals collectively. I have a huge number of AP credits (unrelated to later degrees), a Bachelor's in Engineering, and got an MBA later on before pursuing this. Presumably, I have plenty of ""leftover"" credits, and if I had pursued an Associate's in Paramedicine I'd have just walked into the community college basically doing the course alone and having the rest of my incoming elective credits counted. But as a generic college question: if the sum total of all of my courses and other credits adds up to a degree, am I basically locked out of having that degree? Like, could I basically go to a local community college with an A.S. in Paramedicine, take one course with an existing Paramedic license, and say ""already, graduated!"" Given my other degrees it doesn't *really* matter if I have the Associate's or not, but I was curious how this sort of thing works",Certificate & Records,Medium,1.0,web:reddit:r/college:new,Medium,1,1491,254,3,"If you have other credits and associated certifications, can you basically just ""get an associate's"" after the fact (Paramedic certificate/Associate's program).",0

Professor setting me up to fail. So i’m taking an online Spanish class and one of the requirements is a weekly zoom check in for 15 minutes every Thursday. My first zoom check in was scheduled last Thursday at 2:30. The professor picked out our times weeks in advance and told us we could switch with each other if the times weren’t compatible with our schedule. I work 5 days a week as a pre-k teacher so I asked my manager if I could have someone replace me during my time (it was recess anyway). She agreed so I had no problem with my scheduled check in time. I was sick that Thursday so I did not go to work but I was able to do my zoom check in which is the first one ever btw. I sat in the meeting for 40 minutes and my professor never showed up. I emailed her during the first 5 minutes and she responded 3 hours later saying she lost connection. She asked to reschedule on Friday at 1:30. I immediately emailed her back telling her that I would be at work and I could not leave at that time. She never responded and when Friday rolled around I emailed her again and she still didn’t respond. Today I checked my grades and she gave my an F for my zoom meeting grade and when I asked about it she said I never showed up to the zoom call so there was nothing she could do about it and I should make time for school next time.

"virtual conference fees. I was looking into attending one or two conferences that are favorites of mine this year, thinking that they would be relatively cheap, since they are being offered online. I get that there are still \*some\* expenses associated with organization and hosting of a virtual conference, but I did expect the fees to be discounted more than they are. Registration for a non-student at these conferences looks to be still $400-450. Does this seem a little high to anyone else? Last year I spoke to one of the members of the organizing committee of one of these conferences, and asked him why a particular conference was so much more expensive than others in our field. He replied that ""the society"" was basically stockpiling money from conference fees and trying to figure out what to do with it for the past 10+ years.

"How should I study for college exams if they are based off of critical thinking and not notes and lectures? Are the problem sets aligned to the exam. Hello! I understand all about active recall--making practice problems, teaching, blurting, etc. However, I have heard that college exams are based on critical thinking and not aligned with the lectures and notes. To elaborate, of course, the lectures and notes are related, however, the exam questions will require a much deeper understanding than what the lectures and notes give if what I have heard is right. So, how are you supposed to learn the appropriate level of difficulty required to succeed on the exam? Will a deeper understanding be given by the textbook? Or do I have to guess what I need to do my own research on? Or, are the problem sets aligned with the exam? And if the problem sets are aligned with the exam, then what am I supposed to do in classes that don't have problem sets? One final question I am very curious about is: Will the professor go over how students should go about getting a deeper understanding that is required for the course exam? Will it be on the syllabus?

"PhD student seeking advice. Hi all, I’m a PhD student at an Aussie university. However my supervisor let me live overseas and do my PhD remotely. I moved country to where my husband is a citizen and have permanent residency here. My supervisor was very new and excited to keep me on as a student, and I went in right out of my undergrad at the same university that I did my undergrad. The issue is the small stipend I’ve been receiving was meant for students living in Australia unless with university approval. I didn’t understand that my supervisor doesn’t actually have the authority to give me that approval and let me live overseas. Years later I realized my stipend is taxable in the country I’m in. I amended my tax returns to fix the error but it’s what sent me down a rabbit hole finding all the documents related to my funding. If the tax authorities ask me for more information, will a letter from my supervisor suffice? I took necessary steps. Contacted admin, and then the director in charge who allocates the funds at the university. They have given me an exemption based on what has happened, and are now letting me finish unpaid. My research is low-risk and involved interviews, mostly on zoom. Is there anything else I need to know? Any other corrective measures necessary? I’m very stressed out because we have small children, and I didn’t understand the structure of academia thinking that my visits back to the university once a year was enough based on my supervisory guidance. On a positive note, the university and my supervisor are being supportive. I’m just now concerned about taxes and wondering if this could have any immigration consequences.

"Asking for alternative assignments during this pandemic. Hi y'all. Like most everyone else, all of my classes have been transitioned to online classes, and our spring term just started this week. For two of my classes, most of our graded assignments are videos that students have to record of themselves, and then upload for the rest of the class to see.

"Who are admissions counselors. Who is the person at your high school representing their university? What about the representatives who stand behind their banners at college fairs? Is the person you are talking to going to review your application? How much power do they have over the admissions process? Having a better idea who recruits students and makes decisions will help you better understand your audience when building your applications. Most admissions counselors, at least those working the front lines at college fairs and high school visits, are recent graduates. It’s likely their first job out of college, and they probably stumbled into their position. There is no major or area of study that leads to college admissions in the way that finance funnels into investment banking. Turnover is very high. If you stay for more than two years, you are considered a veteran. I began occupying various leadership positions in professional organizations after my first year, a common occurrence. It’s unlikely that the university representative you speak with your freshman year of high school will be the one recruiting you senior year. Some universities, like Texas A&amp;M, prefer to hire alumni. At UT, most, but not all, of our counselors went to school in Austin. It would be hard for me to represent a university I didn’t attend. Much of my interactions with students and families came from a sincere belief that a Texas education can change your life. My message was that UT transformed my life, and it can transform yours, too. When you talk with an admissions representative, ask if they attended the university that employs them. Some questions to consider: * What was your least favorite part of the university or campus? * If you could change one thing about your alma mater, what would it be? * What were your expectations before you enrolled and how did those play out as you progressed through your education? * What’s the biggest mistake you see applicants make? Our universities pay us to tell you the good things and minimize the bad. College recruiting is not unlike sales. By framing your questions negatively, like asking about your least favorite thing rather than your most favorite, you may get more honest and sincere responses. If anything, it will be different than the nervous script we typically hear from students and parents. So much of college admissions is defining the process on your terms rather than letting the university dictate your behavior. Ask thought provoking and nonscripted questions. You can also “flip the script” if the representatives aren’t alumni. * What’s the biggest complaint you hear current students make? * What surprised you the most when you first arrived on campus for work? * How would you compare your experiences in higher education with your current university? * Did you work in admissions at other universities in the past? * If so, how was their process similar or different to where you currently work? Demographically, higher-education professionals are well represented by women, people of color, and first-generation college students. Many of my male colleagues are gay. It’s one of the few industries where being white, straight, and male puts you in the minority. When I worked for UT, I estimate only about 10 percent of our 150 employees looked like me. Admissions counselors come from many majors though primarily liberal arts, communications, social work, and education. There is always the occasional fine arts, engineering, or business graduate. kevin@texadmissions.com",Transport,Low,0.0,web:pullpush:r/ApplyingToCollege:submission:complaint,Low,0,3557,578,21,Who are admissions counselors.,0

"Should I do anything about my professor. My professor is okay at teaching, but when he gives his assessment quizzes the way he words things are confusing and the way he grades with retakes is unfair and makes the retakes harder because he doesn't show you what you got wrong or right so you can get a better understanding until the day before the exam. For some of the questions, I can't find anything in the book or lecture notes about it despite reading thoroughly. And some of the questions have what feels like more than one of the correct answer and I choose the one that I was able to find that was closest to what I could find in the notes and book. Then when you finish the assessment tells you the score, but it doesn't tell you which questions you got wrong or right. When you retake the assessment it's more of a guessing game because you don't know if the answer you chose is correct or not, and with me I tend to second guess myself a lot so I'll put the same answer I had previously because it made sense to me only to find out it was wrong (since the professor posts what was wrong and right before the exam). And after completing the retake the professor averages the grades which I wouldn't have a problem with if I knew what I got wrong at least so I can get a better understanding and didn't feel like I was being punished for being left in the dark.

"How do you deal with AI generated assignments. First time posting here. It's a bit weird since I'm in Mexico, and we're not really considered professors even if we're teaching at college level, but I feel like you might have some insight. Anyways, this is my second quarter working at this level, I'm fairly new. I teach English as a second language. At the beginning of the quarter, our boss basically told us we couldn't really do anything against AI because we can't prove with 100% certainty that students use it, so all the assignments should be done in class. I generally didn't have many issues, but this last partial, I ran out of time and had to let one of my groups take an essay home. I checked some drafts and general ideas, but it's a large group. I didn't check all of them. This is a very basic essay, we aren't even tackling the issue of quotations and sources but I feel like most of them used AI; the essays are very well redacted. Majority of them got really good scores since I'm focusing more on language use rather than content. If I compare to some activities we've done in class, it doesn't match, but I don't have proof or anything in the syllabus or my rubrics to back me up. Rookie mistake, I guess. Now I can't really do anything about it except give them the alleged grade and move on. Dealing with this group was very stressful for me, and I've heard some of them say I graded too harshly. I imagine they checked out, and I'm kinda checked out too at this point. My contact ends on Wednesday and I have no idea if I'm getting renewed, so I feel like even attempting to bring it up would just drain my energy. They still have to present their final exam tomorrow, so there's still a chance some of them might fail. My question is, how do you design rubrics to avoid the use of AI?

"Moral harassment in academia: My story and its repercussions. I'm an undergraduate student who has been morally harassed for a year by a post-doc in my lab and my PI hasn't done a single thing other than give him a warning. This post-doc guy has a history of such behavior towards women; my PI has always found a way to keep it under the radar because he doesn't want to lose his right-hand man who does everything for him in the lab. No one in the lab wanted to take sides because this guy -- who happens to be batshit crazy -- is directly connected to their projects and could mess them up if he wanted to. When I started working in the lab, both my PI and the crazy guy gave me a project to work on independently due to my past research experience in another lab. The crazy guy was supposed to advise me. In the beginning, everything was perfect and to him I was excellent; but after I said I wouldn't agree with data fabrication, I became a good-for-nothing person who deserved to be yelled at and mistreated constantly. This went on for a year, until I couldn't take it anymore and talked with my PI, who did nothing but give him a warning. I cried every day for a week and my mental health has gone downhill over time. I was working on a synthetic methodology project. I did all the optimization and prepared over 25 compounds to be used as substracts without any help from him. I worked my ass off and the crazy guy wrote the paper and put himself as first author including names of people who did nothing to contribute to the project. The said person just stayed on the phone the whole day while I was working and enduring harassment. My PI said he wouldn't take sides and that If I didn't agree with the established author order he would terminate the project. He also said I could throw all the compounds away or take them with me to my new lab. I can't just leave them to another colleague because that won't please the crazy guy, according to my PI. I don't know what to do and I wish I hadn't been put in this position. After all, my PI was supposed to figured out what to do, not me. I wrote a complaint to the appropriate office in my university about everything the crazy guy did to me, however I still haven't submitted it. I'm afraid he may retaliate in some way -- he is that crazy. Whenever I was in the lab I was afraid he would throw a bottle of acid on my face or something. A professor in my department that advised me to report his behavior told me that filling a complaint is also a way of self-preservation.

"Maybe wanting to retrain, any advice. Hi, I have a master's in Education with a concentration in ESL, but I'm just not a good teacher. I resigned from my last teaching position a few years ago, and I guess I'm really not good at keeping work in general. I was diagnosed with ASD and I have some social communication issues that I guess I don't really recognize. I also might be poorly trained and/or ""lazy."" Since I'm currently between jobs, I've been entertaining the idea of going back to school for more training, but a few obstacles stand in my way--one, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't be eligible for financial aid. I used student loans to finance my pursuit of my bachelor's and master's degrees, so I'm not eligible to take out loans for a second one of those. I also can't use student loans for a non-degree-seeking certificate program. Another issue is the college choices around here are kind of slim, and I don't want to drive a hundred or so miles to attend school each week, so an online option would probably be the best idea. Most online settings provide enough structure for me to actually try to learn the material; the exceptions are MOOC courses, which provide no grades, no fee for entry, and no certificates; they are basically around for educational purposes only, and I'm not motivated enough to teach myself a new skill when there is very little structure and zero accountability or reward. Lastly, I'm not really sure what I want to study. A degree in administration might allow me to become a principal, but if I didn't know what I was doing as a teacher, would I even make a good principal? I've been entertaining the idea of becoming a journalist, but I already have an English degree; do I really need a degree in journalism to become a journalist? Programming would also be a good option, but I don't know where to start, and again, I'm not that good at teaching myself.

"I wrote this text on this sub yesterday to someone else who wanted to know the pros and cons of CC. I’ll paste it here: As someone who goes to community college right now, let me tell you. **Benefits** • Small class size: I hear about how in Uni there can be hundreds of kids in a class, forget that at CC the class sizes are similar to a high school class. My English class ended with 10 people. We started out with 25-30. My CC is notorious for hard English courses. • Saves money: You will save A LOT of money if you go to community college. My tuition is roughly $3k a semester. Plus I’m doing summer courses which is $1.6k. Add that up it’s around $13.6k to get my associates degree. At a State University you’ll be paying around $25k without scholarships every year. That includes room and board. Money talks. • Professors: Professors get to know you better and you’re not just another student. You’ll get more attention in class. •Working part time: You’ll have time to work on the side and get some extra cash. You can probably still do this at University. **Drawbacks: Don’t look over these, because I did.** •Social life: Don’t expect everyone to be a social butterfly at CC. You may not have many friends at CC. A lot of people have friends outside of CC and don’t try and make friends in their classes. This is something to take into consideration. It doesn’t sound very important until you’re bored in your house every night playing games or watching YouTube and anime (this definitely isn’t me). Especially if your CC isn’t in a huge city, people are probably driving from all over to get to CC. Not everyone is going to live 10 minutes away, so this makes it harder to hang outside of school. Even if your high school friends are going to the same CC you may not talk to them as much, life gets busy, and everyone changes after high school. • Other expenses: How will you get to CC? Will you need a car? Where are you getting your food? Take these expenses into consideration. You’ll probably need to work part time, or maybe your parents will help you out a bit until you think you’re ready to work. • Home life: Do you want to get out of your house? Are you comfortable being where you are for at least another 2 years? This could be seen as a benefit or a drawback depending on your situation. Lastly, try and have your major figured out before the fall semester. I wouldn’t be taking summer courses if I just picked my current major from the beginning. If a major speaks to you, regardless of what people think of it, go for it! Also more importantly some classes are only scheduled in the fall or spring semesters, not both. So when you switch your major, you may delay your graduation date.

Not the commenter you responded to but my daughter is attending a private school in the fall rather than the in state public university she was accepted to. In state cost of attendance can vary wildly between the different states. The 25-26 cost of attendance for the in state school before any federal financial aid is $43k which is typical for the schools in our state. Our state schools are also known for very rarely giving any other aid or scholarships. My friend in a state adjacent to ours also has a son starting next year at one of their state schools. The COA there which is typical for their state is $27k before any type of aid. The COA for the private school she is attending is $89k before aid. They originally offered $42k in merit aid but we appealed using competing offers as leverage and got the aid increased to $52k for an end cost of $37k.

The colleague that I work with most closely sent me an email saying that he plans to basically work all summer except for some time off in June. Don't get me wrong, the students and other faculty benefit from his work and dedication. At the same time, if the teaching load is so high (it is) that we don't have time to do this prep during the school year (when we are actually paid), then that's the department's problem to fix. I don't think we should just work harder to cover up a systemic problem. I want to be assertive, but not mean or confrontational. It's obviously my colleagues's choice how he wants to spend his time. I'm thinking of responding with a friendly ""I'm on a 9-month contract, and already have other plans for the summer. I'll be back in August."" I need to set some personal boundaries for the sake of my sanity and personal life. Honestly, my boundary is that I need to work during business hours only, and only during the 9 months when I'm contacted. I will do the very best I can during that time, but if the work starts routinely expanding beyond that, it just won't work for me long-term. I don't mind gently asserting this boundary, but I would like to understand whether this is something that is just not going to work out in academia from a cultural perspective? I did a PhD years ago, and there were practically no boundaries around research (I used to work at night and on the weekend, as did practically everyone else), so I understand that can be a thing. The reality of my life is much different now, though. I'm a single parent, and I will put my kids ahead of my career 100% of the time.

"The oft-repeated adage that this course becomes immensely difficult after the midterm is patently untrue. Yes, the problems get harder and the content leaves the familiar territory of DC circuits. However, it remains simple and perfectly doable. The key is to regularly practice the content. Don't develop a false sense of understanding.

"What should I do on this situation. My Professor has been. pretty rude to me, humiliating me infront of the whole class and every single day, she mentions me everytime and she is handling two subjects- schedule is Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday. My classmates have been treating me awfully since, thinking I'm just stupid. It's affecting me to the point I feel like I should just stop taking college, affecting my major Accounting classes. I know the real world is awful, and even after college or after this semester I'll face more challenges, but next semester she's gonna retired and I was thinking of just retaking her subjects next semester, while dropping it in this semester since her subject is just Minor not Major that is related to my course. Today is October 7, the end of the semester is December 19. I tried telling our Dean and Chairman about the situation and it's still the same, mentioning me every single day- giving me rude comments or giving hints that are unfair. The bad part is we have a group project on her subject, and I was grouped up with people who are the one that thinks I am just unhelpful and shit. They are treating me like I'm dumb. I know that other people has been going through worse. But my freshman in college has been awfully like this, it was hard and overwhelming about the changes considering I have a problem mentally after what I experienced at last years of highschool where I was humiliated, avoided, and ignored by the whole class- talking shit about me to the point I am hurting myself.

"The Only Piece of Advice You Need to Succeed in College. Hello All, I’m a recent grad and realized that August is quickly approaching and that many of you on here are looking for advice on how to succeed in college. I’m here to offer you the only advice you will truly need to balance social life and academic life. This post is most directed towards freshmen, but I didn’t figure it out until my sophomore year, so everyone else welcome. I say this as a graduate of a university, who ended with a 3.87, worked 20+ hours a week during the school year, was involved in multiple clubs, and made some very close friends who I am still in contact with. Do not overthink this. Do exactly what your professors tell you to do, and then go have fun. What I mean by this: Your classes are going to be structured as a series of lectures, homework assignments, projects, tests, readings, optional readings, and extra worksheets. A minority of this stuff will actually be graded. Your professors will probably give you a couple assignments to do, and then your readings, worksheets, notes etc. will not be graded. Hear me when I say this. DO EVERYTHING YOUR PROFESSOR TELLS YOU TO DO They’ve been teaching this class for far longer than you’ve been in college. They know whats needed for you to pass the class. READ EVERY READING, DO EVERY UGRADED ASSIGNMENT. Do not skim, do not use AI summaries and cheat sheets. Just do the work. This also includes that if they say that you should go to office hours, then you should go. A lot of times they will deadass give you the answers to the exam in office hours. Anything that your prof says you should do: do it. And then as soon as you’re done, go out, go party. You’re going to meet a lot of people that skim thru the assignments, don’t do the extra work, and then end up cramming later on. The secret is, if you just do exactly what your prof tells you to do, you will be fully prepared for every test and spend less time in total studying than the kids cramming or doing extra work until 4am. Then as soon as you’re done. Go out. You finish you’re work at 5pm? Go get food with your friends, go to an event, go to the gym, get a job, do something. Do not spend time worrying if you’re ready for your next test, bc if you did everything your professor told you to, then you’re fine. If you’re the kind of person that wants to go to parties but is a lighter/less experienced drinker. Do not drink a lot, drink as little as possible. What you want to think about is your average recovery time. So the more drugs/drinking you do the longer your recovery time is into your school work the next day. If you’re going out on a Thursday, you want to be ready for your classes the next day. I cannot understate how much an edge you will have on your classmates if you just generally stay soberish (and hydrated), and do all the work your professors tell you to do. If you’re not getting slowed down by drinking and drugs and you’re doing all your work, you’re deadass unstoppable. Speaking from personal experience, using this model you can be going out like 4 times a week, passing all your classes, chilling. People take things too far a lot in college, and moderation is learned. But don’t overthink this shit. It’s gonna be fine. (And maybe do something else besides party with your time too, clubs, sports, jobs, etc are all super cool experiences to have on campus, and if you follow the model you will have plenty of time to do it all) A last word of encouragement: friends take time and effort to make. Try to be friendly with everyone you meet, get people’s numbers, invite people out to lunch, it’s only weird if you make it weird. Best of luck to everyone, hope this helps Edit* College is of course a part of regular life, and most of us end up experiencing financial, family, housing, etc problems. This model means that when times get tough, you stop going to parties, you prioritize your job, etc. But you ALWAYS make sure you do exactly as your professor advises. You can make it through basically any crisis with your degree intact if you just do all of the work. Edit* A lot of times profs wont explicitly tell you what to do during the lectures. Don’t be afraid. READ THE SYLLABUS, SYLLABUS IS BIBLE It’s probably all written in there, or on your digital learning platform, etc. trust me it’s written somewhere, or they’ll tell u. I’m sure this seems a bit obvious but you would be surprised how long it takes to get the hang of. You can waste so much time worrying ab your grades and not having fun, or you can j get your shit done and then go out",Academic,Medium,1.0,web:reddit:r/college:search:exam schedule problem,Medium,2,4595,857,0,The Only Piece of Advice You Need to Succeed in College.,0

"Editing Essays Part 4: Shourya from Kath Path College Apps. Hey everyone! Here’s another sample essay with feedback to help people get an idea of how to write a great essay/improve an already good one. Thanks to u/sswally for the suggestion that I do a series on Kath Path essays, and u/Spiritual-Low2011 for suggesting Shourya’s in particular. --- **The Da Vinci Code** Everyone at my table was convinced that I was possessed by witches. “Oh my god, are you okay?” I shot a cavalier look to the girl sitting next to me, whose face blinded me in trepidation. My kindergarten teacher continued mumbling the dangers of running in the hallway. “What?” I asked. “Your finger. it was shaking, what happened?” It was a common response. I was “writing” in the air, waving each letter with my index finger. Any thought that popped into my head, I subconsciously wrote out before me. This occurred spontaneously; one second I’m captivated in a discussion with my peers and the other I’m frantically whisking my hand in the middle of a conversation. My mother told me I had this strange habit of “air writing” since the age of two. To avoid attracting attention to myself, I transcribed my thoughts and words into a pocketbook. Much to my chagrin, publicly writing during recess made me even more “popular.” “Hey look, Shourya’s writing in his diary!” sang five boys in unison. Abashed as I was, my fingers instinctively scrawled in the air, “How did they match pitch so perfectly?” Embarrassment diffused up my neck and into my watering eyes. Within seconds, they encircled me, ripping the velvet notebook out of my hands. Cursorily flipping the pages, they recited my deepest thoughts as if a chorus to a pop song. Vowing never to undergo that experience again, I stopped writing. One day when learning about the Renaissance, my teacher mentioned Leonardo Da Vinci, how his notes were written in reverse mirror script. I jumped at the idea, envisioning this method’s incredible implications. I observed the florid strokes of Da Vinci, inspecting how the tail of each letter joined in the opposite direction. My hiatus was over. All my notes were now written backwards. In class, when I was spotted scribbling in my notebook, the same five boys approached me. “Been a while since we last saw you with that diary, huh?” I smiled, and placed the book into their hands. Ten eyebrows rose in consternation as they exchanged looks of bewilderment. The same thoughts they easily chanted now resembled hieroglyphics. I was no longer teased for air-writing or my notebook, however those five boys inadvertently bestowed upon me the most irreplaceable gift. The gift of handwriting. The purest form of human expression. Since Da Vinci, I observed the handwritings of all those around me: my peers, my teachers, my parents, analyzing the infinitesimal units of each scribble amalgamating with one another. If I noticed a component of someone’s handwriting that I found clever, perhaps an alternate way to connect an “o” to an “r”, I practiced it profusely, fluttering my often distended index finger to embed the new pattern into my arsenal of chirography. From the trivial resort to a different manner of expressing what I felt must be expressed, I have swam in the pools of all the handwriting that I uncover. The handwriting of each person is tailored and crafted by the implicit nuances of their personality and character; by studying the handwriting of people I encountered, I was not only able to unearth their latent, invaluable values but also appreciate the subtleties that compose the fibers of their being. It is a profound thought that every single letter I consume, has been drawn by hand and released into the world. By acknowledging the scripted peculiarities of others, I have established my own kaleidoscope of handwriting, my own style, my own typeface. With my handwriting I paint with words, encompassing all the fonts and penmanship around me. Do I have a bit of Times New Roman? Yes. A bit of Helvetica? Sure. A bit of Comic Sans? Never. --- **Overall Positives:** - The author showcases an experience where they overcame adversity. - We learn about the author’s curiosity and unique interests. - The essay is well-written and does a good job of incorporating dialogue. **Overall Negatives:** - There’s not much of a *point* to the essay. While we learn at the very end that calligraphy helped the author learn more about others, that’s the most obvious positive trait that this essay highlights. There’s far more story than reflection, and it takes too long to get there. - Too many big words! Like the first Kath Path essay I edited, it sounds like the author is using words they wouldn’t regularly use in conversation, distracting the reader from the flow of the essay. - Clearer transitions would be helpful between different moments in the story. --- **Line-by-line edits:** Everyone at my table was convinced that I was possessed by witches. “Oh my god, are you okay?” I shot a cavalier look to the girl sitting next to me, whose face blinded me in trepidation. My kindergarten teacher continued mumbling the dangers of running in the hallway. &gt; This is a good opening line: it’s unique and draws the reader in. But by the third paragraph, there are too many jargon-y words. Cavalier? Trepidation? It doesn’t feel like you really know what these words mean. It’s always better to write in a way that feels natural to you. &gt;The “my kindergarten teacher” sentence is pretty throwaway; I’d cut it. These details are good for storytelling, but they take up space that could be used for reflection. “What?” I asked. “Your finger. it was shaking, what happened?” It was a common response. I was “writing” in the air, waving each letter with my index finger. Any thought that popped into my head, I subconsciously wrote out before me. This occurred spontaneously; one second I’m captivated in a discussion with my peers and the other I’m frantically whisking my hand in the middle of a conversation. My mother told me I had this strange habit of “air writing” since the age of two. &gt; This is a unique subject for an essay; props for originality. However, I wish we got a little more detail on why this happened or what it reflected about you. Ultimately, the air-writing is only part of the essay so that we can get to your interest in handwriting—but I want to hear about the air-writing! Does it showcase creativity? Introspection? Make sure that each part of your essay clearly connects to the overall message about yourself rather than simply telling the AO about a quirk of your personality. &gt; There are some grammar/style issues here that make this harder to read. The sudden jump to present tense feels jarring and unnecessary; think about how much more sense this would make as “One second I’d be captivated by a discussion with my peers, and the next I’d be…” (This sentence could also be cut in order to add more space for reflection, if necessary). And odd phrasing like “captivated in” instead of “captivated by” also distracts the AO from the content of the essay. To avoid attracting attention to myself, I transcribed my thoughts and words into a pocketbook. Much to my chagrin, publicly writing during recess made me even more “popular.” &gt; I’d make this a new paragraph with a more clear transition sentence--it makes more sense as “I started transcribing” instead of “I transcribed.” It would also help to add more emotional detail here and later in the essay. Why did it feel unpleasant to be the subject of unwanted attention? How did this change not only your behavior (i.e. going from air-writing to writing in a notebook) but your personality and your perception of those around you? These are the personal reflections that communicate more about your identity than a change in behavior. “Hey look, Shourya’s writing in his diary!” sang five boys in unison. Abashed as I was, my fingers instinctively scrawled in the air, “How did they match pitch so perfectly?” Embarrassment diffused up my neck and into my watering eyes. Within seconds, they encircled me, ripping the velvet notebook out of my hands. Cursorily flipping the pages, they recited my deepest thoughts as if a chorus to a pop song. Vowing never to undergo that experience again, I stopped writing. &gt; This is where it would be helpful to have more elaboration and personal reflection. Writing was clearly important to you: how did it feel to stop entirely? Did this affect your mood or relationships? While this is a unique concept, right now it feels like the theme of the essay is the typical “I changed myself to fit in but realized I would rather stand out.” Not to beat a dead horse, but it’s the reflection that makes a generic theme stand out. &gt; I feel like the academic language also detracts from the emotional impact of this paragraph: it’s a very personal story, but using words like “diffused” and “cursorily” disconnects the reader. One day when learning about the Renaissance, my teacher mentioned Leonardo Da Vinci, how his notes were written in reverse mirror script. I jumped at the idea, envisioning this method’s incredible implications. I observed the florid strokes of Da Vinci, inspecting how the tail of each letter joined in the opposite direction. My hiatus was over. All my notes were now written backwards. &gt; This paragraph really needs a transition sentence—we have no idea how many years have passed or what we’re doing in history class. It would be clearer and sound nicer to have a sentence connecting these two paragraphs like “I didn’t start [writing] again until…” &gt; Your switch to backwards writing feels like an extremely abrupt shift. How did you learn to write backwards so quickly, and did you have to practice? This could be a place to show the AO your creativity, dedication, etc. &gt; Again, it feels like you’re misusing words like “envision” and “florid” — can you really envision implications? Simplifying the writing would make it feel much more natural. In class, when I was spotted scribbling in my notebook, the same five boys approached me. “Been a while since we last saw you with that diary, huh?” I smiled, and placed the book into their hands. Ten eyebrows rose in consternation as they exchanged looks of bewilderment. The same thoughts they easily chanted now resembled hieroglyphics. I was no longer teased for air-writing or my notebook, however those five boys inadvertently bestowed upon me the most irreplaceable gift. The gift of handwriting. The purest form of human expression. &gt; I’ll be honest, this feels a little made up. The same five boys? They stopped bullying you immediately? Maybe it really happened, but it feels a bit too teen-movie-esque to be true. Incorporating more emotion and reflection into the writing would make this more believable--instead of just telling us what happened, explain how you felt/reacted to the bullying, and reflect on what this says about you as a person with specific traits (resilience, creativity) instead of specific interests (calligraphy). &gt; I’m also not a huge fan of the writing in this section: the sentence fragments at the end might flow better if they followed a colon, and “however” is used improperly. This is nitpicky stuff, but especially in an essay that’s indirectly about writing, it’s important to be grammatically correct. Since Da Vinci, I observed the handwritings of all those around me: my peers, my teachers, my parents, analyzing the infinitesimal units of each scribble amalgamating with one another. If I noticed a component of someone’s handwriting that I found clever, perhaps an alternate way to connect an “o” to an “r”, I practiced it profusely, fluttering my often distended index finger to embed the new pattern into my arsenal of chirography. &gt; Once again, a small complaint: “since Da Vinci” makes it sound like you’ve been studying handwriting since the 15th century. This could be better as “since that day on the playground” or something similar. There are also tense issues: it should be “I have observed” and “if I notice,” assuming this is something you still do today. And again with the vocabulary: “Arsenal of chirography?” “Infinitesimal units?” Really? From the trivial resort to a different manner of expressing what I felt must be expressed, I have swam in the pools of all the handwriting that I uncover. The handwriting of each person is tailored and crafted by the implicit nuances of their personality and character; by studying the handwriting of people I encountered, I was not only able to unearth their latent, invaluable values but also appreciate the subtleties that compose the fibers of their being. &gt; The first sentence of this paragraph just doesn’t make sense to me. The image of swimming in a pool of handwriting is a bit off-putting. &gt; This is also the first point in the essay where you really show some reflection. Even though this is a story-based essay with lots of different characters, it is only at this point that we realize what you’ve learned about other people from your experiences. Weaving this idea—that your interest in handwriting/writing in general led you to be more observant/appreciate others—throughout the essay, or at least mentioning it earlier, would reveal more about you and what you’ll bring to a school. It is a profound thought that every single letter I consume, has been drawn by hand and released into the world. By acknowledging the scripted peculiarities of others, I have established my own kaleidoscope of handwriting, my own style, my own typeface. With my handwriting I paint with words, encompassing all the fonts and penmanship around me. &gt; To be honest, this feels like a bit of a nothing paragraph. It’s so strangely worded that it doesn’t feel like it means anything. Are you saying that being more observant of others led you to develop and define your own unique personality? If so, that could be said more explicitly. The image of encompassing everyone else’s styles, while it may be intended to make you seem like an adaptable person, also makes you sound like you’re less unique, if anything. Ultimately, this seems like a metaphor that got away from you and lost its connection to a clear quality or trait. Do I have a bit of Times New Roman? Yes. A bit of Helvetica? Sure. A bit of Comic Sans? Never. &gt; I don’t think this ending works. It feels like it was slapped on so that you could say you had a conclusion. For one thing, fonts on a computer are different from the handwriting styles of individuals, so the connection is unclear. And while I’m all for Comic Sans hatred, it’s an overdone joke that’s not linked to the rest of your essay. The section immediately before this would probably work better as a conclusion that’s linked to the entirety of the essay. --- **Overall:** - If your story is mostly narrative-based, make sure to include some explicit reflection or emotional moments within the plot so the AO still gets a clear message about you and your identity. Focus less on specific details of the story and more on how each moment had an emotional impact or shaped you in some way. - Make sure you have clear transition sentences! - Prioritize making your story clear and fluid over using elevated language. --- **I’d love to hear more suggestions of essays I should edit publicly!

"I may have to withdraw from school because I cannot afford it. I just want to start off by saying that I do not know where to post this and feel like I do not know who I should talk to about this. I also apologize if this seems incoherent, I am currently losing my mind a bit and just wrote what I thought was important. I am currently a graduate student working towards a Master’s Degree and a Teaching Credential in Secondary Teaching, but I may have to withdraw and go back to work because I cannot afford it. Like most Teacher Preparation Programs, you are pretty much working full-time, but not making any money. This program is different though. This program has a component where you can make a living while also working towards your degree. This was made possible by being hired on as a substitute teacher through your placement school and working as a substitute. Esssentially, you could work full time as a building substitute. This is obviously enticing to anyone looking to become a teacher because most programs do not offer anything like this. I naturally applied to the graduate program, got accepted and began preparing for the program to begin. I had attended the program interest meeting where they gave an overview of the program. They specifically mentioned and highlighted how their program is different because of the unique opportunity to earn money while studying in school. I inquired more about the pathway and they shared with me that I would have to send in a separate application for this pathway should you not want to take the traditional student teacher pathway, but more details would be shared later should you be accepted into the program. (red flag) As mentioned, I had applied and got accepted into the program, so I was just waiting to attend orientation to hear details about this pathway. Orientation comes and we are going over everything: the classes we are to take, visiting campuses to be matched with a mentor teacher, financial aid, etc… They touched upon on earn money pathway and shared that you would have to fill out an application that would be sent to the program director where they would share the information with the school. On the application, you were able to mark whether you wanted to substitute full-time or substitute part-time. I had submitted my application and there were no issues on my end (at least what was communicated,) so I just focused on my classes (my classes began in the summer) and I just waited for the school year to begin. This was back in May and I was already working at the time as a Special Education Teacher, so I wanted to keep my flow of income if I were to do this program. I should mention that I am 24 (M) and moved out-of-state after graduating from college, so I do not have any family with me, which made it super imperative that I could support myself if I were to do this program. I wrote my resignation letter at the beginning of July to my principal before school started up again because I wanted to give them ample time to find a replacement and I was under the impression that I was good to go for the upcoming school year. Fast forward to about a week ago, I learned from some of my peers who are also doing this pathway (not from the program director,) that we can only substitute two times a week versus a full-time schedule. We essentially could only sub two days a week and would work under our mentor teacher for the remaining of the week. This brought a huge amount of anxiety onto me. I wanted to confirm with the program director about this information and they indeed confirmed that this was true. They also wrote back as in this had always been the case when in reality it was not mentioned at all. This brings to me why I am writing this post: I basically quit my job, took out loans to complete classes over the summer, do not know what to go from here and I feel like I am losing my mind. This past week I have been scrambling trying to find jobs that way I could make this program work, but I have not been having any luck. I have not been finding much because I feel like my constricted hours due to my classes and going to my placement school do not work. I do have an interview lined up for a tutoring position, but this alone could not support me through the program. Even if I did the tutoring and worked as a sub, I would still be a bit short in paying for all of my expenses. I am just at a loss. My special education license is still active and I know school districts are always hiring, so I am not too worried about finding another job, but I am just upset how I landed in this predicament. It feels unreal. At the same time though, I do feel a sense of relief. I’ve already met my mentor teacher and worked with them a bit discussing how the school year is going to unfurl. In one meeting, my mentor teacher met with another teacher in the department going over the content for the next few weeks. My mentor teacher said and prefaced that I should not take it personally (I was present in the meeting) that they have to babysit me and two other teachers. Essentially, I imagine my mentor teacher is expressing that they feel overwhelmed as they are the department lead and the two teachers are new to the district (one, however, is completely new to teaching) Should I withdraw from the program, I will be one less thing my mentor teacher has to worry about. It’s important that I mention that I believe that my mentor teacher did not know I was matched with them originally based on my peers overwhelmingly sharing that their mentor teachers did not know they were matched with my peers. This goes into my next point that this program seems incredibly disorganized and does not communicate well. Most of these complaints have come from discussions with my peers, but some have expressed that they had to communicate between multiple people to get an answer to a question, the answers they received where false, and one peer had not been matched with a teacher with only a few weeks with school starting. Others expressed that when they asked questions, they were made to feel like they should have already known the answer to the question. I’ve also heard that the program’s length is also changing from 14 months to 12 months, which has not been communicated out, but just word of mouth. My point is that everything seems unpredictable and it is difficult trying to get the correct information. Additionally, I had my first day on Thursday and meeting the kids for the first time, has made me wondering whether I want to work with high school students. I am not sure if it’s just because it was the first day of school, but I felt a little bit judged. I should mention that I am gay and not super “macho” masculine, so that might be different to what these students are used to. I know it’s not a lot of time so it is not fair, but that was my first impression. I came across a Reddit Post where I was searching whether elementary, middle or high school teachers are most in-demand and there was a comment that said one should go into elementary school if you are more interested in pedagogy and child development and one should go to high school if you are more passionate about one subject. I do not know why, but that comment struck a cord in me because it seems like it provided clarity into maybe what I should be doing. I am not super passionate about my subject and find myself more interested in the pedagogy and child development. I also feel like my personality is more suited towards younger kids. I had worked in a middle school previously. I want to make it clear that I want to stay in education and do not see myself leaving this sector. My plan is just work and possibly go back to school in the future when I can afford it and possibly look into a primary school preparation program. I do not know where to go from here. I do have loving and supportive parents, but I did not want to burden them as they worry a lot. They also do not know I went back to school, so I just feel like dumping all of this on them would not be good for their mental health. I feel like I just needed to write out what’s going on and seeing if anyone has advice or to share their thoughts. I definitely am learning that I have to be prepared for anything that can go south just so I have my back watched, but it just feels so unreal.

"Hate being a TA. So I’m writing this in hopes of getting some advice or hearing from others who have had similar experiences. I’m a first-year grad student in a thesis-based biology master’s program. In order to get my tuition waived and receive a stipend, I have to work as a TA. This wasn’t the original plan. We were initially told we’d be RAs, but due to funding issues (thanks to the big orange man), the school stepped in to fund the program under the condition that we serve as TAs. I thought it would just be one class a week, which I could manage, but it’s actually two lab sections, each lasting three hours. On top of that, we have a mandatory two-hour TA meeting every week, plus we’re required to observe a lab section before teaching our own. All of this is in addition to my own coursework and the research I need to complete in the lab. I honestly feel like I barely have time for everything and it’s overwhelming. I can handle research and classes, but adding teaching into the mix is too much honestly. And it’s not just showing up to teach. You have to hold office hours, prep for labs, and read the material to make sure you know what you’re talking about. They keep saying it’ll help us get more comfortable with public speaking, but I’ve never struggled with that. The biggest benefit is, of course, the waived tuition, plus a chance to review old content…but it comes at the cost of having no time for myself. At one point I was so excited to start my masters and now I'm feeling extremely miserable and regretful. I don’t know what to do… maybe there’s nothing to do but suck it up. Anyways I just needed to vent. My TA classes were canceled this week, and I can’t even explain how much more manageable everything suddenly felt. I’m running experiments next week, and I honestly don’t know how I’ll have the time to keep up with them given how crammed my schedule already is. Am I being dramatic, what is your experience with being a TA and any advice on how to deal or get out of it would be appreciated. Edit : Just want to clarify the school has 2 thesis tract masters program…. One for TA and one for RA. The RA only program which I was accepted into pays more because its funded elsewhere and your only expected to keep up your GPA and do research. The funding was pulled, then the school sued and got the funding back. However in the between time that they weren't sure we would get the money for the program, the school stepped up to help keep the program going with the requirement that we'd TA. By the time they won the lawsuit and got the money back it was too late to pull us out of the obligation to TA. Especially because they don't know if they will try and pull the funding again for the next school year. I know I'm complaining because its not what I wanted but I recognize I am lucky to even be in this position and I don't want to offend anyone who couldn't attend their dream program at all because of funding issues. I'm just struggling to adjust my mind because my expectations were research and classwork. Thank all you amazing souls for your feedback and advice. Thank you for validating my feelings and giving me honest opinions. I'm gonna just power through and do do my best to manage my time better. Maybe talk to them with a few other grad students who share the same concern and hopefully they will make some adjustments.

"I feel a little lost and unsure on what to do. Hey everyone, I hope you are all doing great! Like many of you guys, I’m in a bit of a rough situation right now where I’m looking for career advice and hoping to get some questions answered as to what next steps I should take for my future, so I’ll do my best to explain my situation and what I’m thinking/feeling. I’m currently a 21 y/o Business Finance major at a public university that is somewhat reputable. I applied and enrolled here immediately after high school when I graduated, so I have been doing my undergraduate since Fall 2021. When I first applied, I really wanted to study something related to Real Estate/Development, however my school never had an undergraduate program in that sector. I came in as a Business Entrepreneurship major, but after my second semester, I ended up switching over to Business Finance, as it was the next thing closest to Real Estate. My major switch application got accepted, and I started taking the required classes. Fast forward to today, and it is now March 2025. I’m in my final semester of my senior year, and I’m getting ready to graduate in May, which is in less than 2 months. It’s crazy to think that these 4 years went by so fast! I can honestly still remember my time when I was a freshman and first year, so “senioritis” has really been hitting me hard ever since this semester started. Even though I’m happy to graduate, I genuinely wish I enjoyed my time a lot more. For my first 2.5 years of university, I would just attend my classes and barely talk to anyone. I would never attend any meetings or get involved with clubs or go to games or hang out after my classes. I would just go straight home and head to my part time fast food job, which really got me nowhere. It wasn’t until my Spring 2024 semester that I began attending club meetings for extra credit that made me wish I would’ve gotten involved sooner, so the regret really hit me because the workshops were very interesting. This past Fall semester, another big example, I began attending my school’s football games, and man, I just cannot put into words how much I enjoyed them. The energy was unmatched, the turnouts were huge, and just being there surrounded by peers and students cheering on your school’s team really lit me up with so many emotions, so the experience was unforgettable. I also went to a few volleyball, basketball, and baseball games, which I, once again, regretted not going to for previous years. I probably could have graduated a semester early (Fall 2024), but I wasn’t able to because I didn’t apply for graduation or take the final business capstone course, so instead I decided to push back graduation to this Spring. This meant that last semester, I would only be taking 2 business classes for the entire term, which I didn’t think would be a good idea because commuting to campus for 2 classes would be seriously underwhelming. After talking with a few advisors, I thought it would be a great idea to explore other departments/careers and declare a minor, which I had been wanting to do for years. I couldn’t decide on psychology or political science, but I found out I could do both at the same time and still be able to graduate on time, and that is the route I ended up taking. Last semester, I took 2 business courses, 2 psychology courses, and 3 political science classes (all of which I passed), and this semester, I’m currently taking 2 business classes, 2 political science classes, and 3 psychology classes, so I’m hoping I can meet these requirements this semester. In terms of clubs, I’ve joined mostly business associations that are all student led, but I’m not actually on the board or an officer, just a regular paying member that attends weekly meetings.The clubs I’ve joined include financial management, banking/investment, a hispanic business association, and also the political science honor society. What I will say though is that last semester, a new club was founded by a well known real estate professor from a different university, and it caught my attention because the club was going to be focused on real estate. I attended almost every meeting, and this past winter break, the professor reached out to me and asked me if I wanted to be on the board, to which I said yes. Ever since then, I’ve been actively participating in the club and meeting many professionals while collaborating with talented peers. I’ve taken many business classes as well, but the two that stand out the most (in my opinion) are the business honors program that my school offers (where students work with a company all semester long and then present their findings/work to classmates) **AND** a student investment managed fund course (where students research companies and pitch buy/hold/sell stock recommendations using real money to the advisory board). Both of these courses are upper division electives that I will probably add to my LinkedIn/Resume because it’ll mean I’m an honors student and student investment analyst, which I’m hoping can look good. In many ways, however, I think I shot myself in the foot because I never actually got an internship or landed a job relating to business/finance/real estate. I mentioned that I worked a fast food job, which was true. I started working this part time job when I was 15 and a junior in high school, and I got way too comfortable that I didn’t quit until just this last November, so I was there for 5.5 years from 2019 to 2024. I’ve been working in event security since summer and also started another part time retail position at a local Target in November after quitting the fast food restaurant, but I always pushed the internship until “later” and never did it. I think it would’ve been insanely useful to attach that to my LinkedIn profile and Resume to show that I got some experience, but at this point it’s a little too late. I can probably get an internship this summer or do my best to land a full time job, but again without that experience I think my chances will be pretty slim. This leads me to where I am now. I’ve applied for graduation, and my ceremony will be taking place some time in May. I’m having mixed emotions, because although I’m looking forward to it and happy that I’m going to be completing my undergrad, at the same time, I’m currently at this stage where in my head I have this “what now?” mentality where I’m afraid that I won’t get a chance to land a job with my bachelor’s degree and what I’ve done these past 4 years in university. I would totally be okay with doing an internship, even though it’s a late late into my professional career so that I can get the work experience and MAYBE have a shot of getting an offer, but again, with my limited accomplishments and little experience, I feel as if my chances of getting a full time position immediately after are slim. With that being said, the reason why I thought about posting this here is because I’ve been thinking more and more about continuing my education in a variety of ways, with one of my options being graduate school. My university recently launched a Masters in Finance program where they only accept applications in the Spring, so if I miss the deadline soon (which is in a couple of weeks), I won’t be able to apply until next year. The program is structured in a way so that students have the option of continuing taking courses in a part time or full time schedule, but from what it looks like, it is a mix of hybrid and in-person classes. On top of that, they are much later in the afternoon/evening so that students can work their jobs in the morning and then commute to campus for the classes. A lot of these classes are also going to be held on Saturdays, and they all appear to be 4 hour long lectures. Still, now is also a good time to mention that on Wednesday, there was an info session held by the directors of the program for anyone interested in pursuing the graduate degree, and when I asked if they would recommend the Master in Finance program for someone like me who is interested in pursuing something in real estate, they simply said “no” without elaborating much. I really like the thought about doing graduate school at a young age while I still have that momentum and passion to learn because I feel like in a couple years down the road, I may lose this mindset and won’t want to return. On the other hand though, I’ve been hearing it’s best to get some sort of work experience first and then return to do your masters to save money and be able to learn with a different mindset. Then again, I don’t know how expensive it’ll be because from what I know, students typically receive less financial aid after completing their undergrad. In short, I’m wondering if I should do one or the other or both at the same time. I’ve also been thinking more and more about my minors in both psychology and political science. As weird as it’ll sound, I have actually been really enjoying these classes a lot, so much so that I have been pondering the idea of finding a way to turn them into majors. My psychology professors have been really amazing, the topics that we’ve been covering have been really interesting, and the classmates that I’ve had/met are awesome. My political science classes have also been really amazing, and as I mentioned earlier, I was able to get into the honor society because I fulfilled the requirements. I’ve been able to attend workshops and meetings related to both fields, and it’s made me think more deeply about how I should’ve considered a career in them when I first started my college journey. I think the reason why I chose them as minors was because I took both AP Psychology and Government and Politics when I was in my senior year in high school, and I found both courses equally intriguing. I think my biggest regret is that I could’ve done a double major if I had petitioned for it early on, but once again, I made the mistake of only considering them later on in my college career and just for the minor. One of my classmates in a political science course that I had last semester got me thinking about law school too, but then again, I think a minor alone may not get me far. I would totally be down to get a bachelor’s in either career, even though this would require more time and money, but still, I guess I would be doing these for personal reasons? Whether or not it’ll even be worth it, I have no idea. I also know there’s an Advanced Real Estate Development Certificate program where students need to take 13 units (equivalent to 4 classes), and I know that there is also a Masters in Urban Planning (MUP) program that the school offers to graduate students. Again, I’m interested in Real Estate Development, which I’m sure is something completely different from the MSF program. Again, I was very interested in the MSF program since it’s relatively new, so the fact that the faculty members just said “no, we wouldn’t recommend it.” really made me feel underwhelming. Anyways, I have a lot of questions. I think the issue is that not only do I genuinely want to keep on studying and learning (whether it’s getting the MSF, MUP, Psychology, Law School, etc.), but also the fact that I’m incredibly indecisive as to what I want to do. I want to keep learning while I still have that momentum going, while I’m still young, and while I can because of what is currently happening in our political climate. On top of that, I believe (if I’m not mistaken) FAFSA/Financial Aid covers 6 years, and if I graduate this May then that would mean I used up 3.5 years if I began in 2021 no? Would that mean I could study for another 2.5 years and receive financial assistance as well? Also if this is true, how does the 6 year thing work? Do you need to be enrolled in school consecutively (back to back) in order to receive assistance or can you use up 3.5 years of financial aid and then return some other year, such as 2028 for example and then use up those other 2.5 years of aid (I apologize if this question made no sense or wasn’t framed well). I understand going to law school and/or receiving a second bachelor’s degree might not seem like a smart move because there’s that whole argument of “you need to consider what job/career you really want” (you can’t be a real estate developer, business psychologist, and business lawyer all at once can you?), which I guess is true and I don’t want to just throw money away for a degree I may not even practice, but I think my main reasoning is that I want to do it for myself. I mean being able to get a second major and then go to law school would be pretty awesome, at least for me. I just don’t know if I’ll have to start at square 1 and retake every single class, even the GE ones OR if I can just “double dip” or something since I took all of these when I did my undergrad for finance and just pick up with the main psychology courses for example, so I truly have no idea how long this will take. Maybe 1.5 - 2 years? I hope it’s not a dumb question, but what about doing my undergrad in psychology and also doing my masters in either finance or urban planning in the same school at once? Is that possible? I think it might be but, once again, I’ll also need to consider time conflicts and make sure not to take on too much work and stress myself out. And then again, there’s the whole “financial assistance” issue. I don’t know, there’s just so much that I really want to do and I’m incredibly indecisive, so I don’t know if I should just forget about my interest in psych and law OR revisit them in the future when I’m older or something and just focus on internships/work at the moment. **Edit:** So unfortunately, I just found out that my school doesn’t allow students to obtain a second bachelor’s. In other words, I can only move forward with the master’s degree/graduate school at the moment. I guess this is kind of disappointing considering that I really wanted to do the undergraduate thing in either psychology or political science, so I guess my only options are either graduate school in either of those fields or my business fields (Urban Planning or finance) OR just head straight to work OR do internships. I feel like if I were to be interested in the Masters in Psychology for example, my chances of getting in would be slim considering I’ve only taken a few psychology courses, mostly upper division ones. On top of that, as I stated above, I have no idea if you can pursue 2 masters at once. I would’ve totally been okay with either doing a second bachelors alone or at the same time along with graduate school, but I guess now my options are limited. I could’ve sworn a friend of mine did something similar where he did two degrees at the same institution I’m currently going to, so maybe it’s because they are closely related? I don’t know, but I definitely should have done more research. Anyways, I’m sorry if I confused you or bored you to death with this insanely long post for being undecided and inconclusive, but what do you guys think? Any recommendations would be seriously appreciated, as I’m at this stage where I graduate in May and don’t know what I really want to do.

"Considering leaving university to return to community college for the time being after this semester. Hello, I am considering leaving university after this semester for a period of time to instead take my classes at my local cc which I’m very familiar with as I’ve gone there for a long time. I’m going into electrical engineering and I still have prerequisites I have to fulfill to get admitted to the major. Im struggling in my computer science class specifically and i am even considering dropping the class as i have also dealt with some unfair treatment via my instructor and I need a more familiar environment to be able to comfortably work towards understanding the material I am struggling with most to learn. I was going to be taking chemistry at my local cc next semester anyway as the chemistry dept here is notoriously bad (on academic probation). I take a bus to get around as I don’t drive either so it’ll be difficult to take classes at both locations so I was considering taking a semester or two off of university to finish off my prerequisites at cc. Not to mention, I have to have a minimum gpa of 3.4 to get into the EE program. Is this a good idea?

"Official transcript change from a COVID academic appeal. Hi everyone, I apologize if this is not the right community to ask this but I'm seeking some guidance/opinions on how to go about an academic situation regarding state college. I was in college finishing up my AA degree when the pandemic hit in 2020. I unfortunately went through some family issues related to COVID during the semester (March 2020), so I sought out my options through my college. During this time, they were offering a 'refund and disenrollment' type appeal. I decided to apply for this as I didn't think I was going to be able to pass my courses at the time with what I was going through. I was accepted for this appeal. On my decision letter sent when I was accepted, it states that the courses I was taking would be ""removed from my official college transcript"". After COVID, I didn't go back to school as I was facing some challenges with my mental health. In January 2025, I decided to go back to school. I am also wanting to apply to my current school's nursing program when I finish up the prereqs for it soon. I am currently attending a different state college from the one I was enrolled in when the pandemic hit. Upon going back to school, I had my past college send my transcripts to my new college. I found out that those courses I got the appeal for are on my transcript, and they are all F's (3 courses). This is extremely upsetting as my GPA was a 3.98 before these courses hit my transcript. I am also very scared it's going to affect me getting accepted into the nursing program. I know that I need to call my old college and ask about it, I'm just having A LOT of anxiety surrounding it and have read online that official transcripts cannot be changed. I guess I'm just seeking some opinions on how I should go about this and if anyone has experienced anything remotely similar. Does anyone think they will remove these? I plan on calling tomorrow and explaining, I also have the decision letter where it states the courses would be removed.

"JRR Tolkien's post to r/professors. I remember clearly enough when I was your age (in 1935). I had returned 10 years before (still dewy-eyed with boyish illusions) to Oxford, and now disliked undergraduates and all their ways, and had begun really to know dons. Years before I had rejected as disgusting cynicism by an old vulgarian the words of warning given me by old Joseph Wright. ‘What do you take Oxford for, lad?’ ‘A university, a place of learning.’ ‘Nay, lad, it’s a factory! And what’s it making? I’ll tell you. It’s making fees. Get that in your head, and you’ll begin to understand what goes on.’ Alas! by 1935 I now knew that it was perfectly true. At any rate as a key to dons’ behaviour. Quite true, but not the whole truth. (The greater part of the truth is always hidden, in regions out of the reach of cynicism.) I was stonewalled and hindered in my efforts (as a schedule B professor on a reduced salary, though with schedule A duties) for the good of my subject and the reform of its teaching, by vested interests in fees and fellowships.

"MDPI is problematic — even Q1 journals can’t guarantee quality. I am a former MDPI editor, and I can confirm this is true. After spending over a year there, I saw the rotten truth behind the academic publishing industry: even journals ranked Q1 are not always trustworthy. The company constantly pressured editors to meet monthly quotas. The more papers you processed, the higher your bonus. Some editors earned quarterly bonuses several times their salary. It’s no surprise that this company prioritized quantity over quality. If you’re wondering how they manage to publish so many articles, here’s what I observed from the inside: 1. They rely heavily on reviewers who frequently review in exchange for vouchers to publish their own papers for free. Most of these reviewers are not interested in providing deep, constructive feedback — they review to collect voucher rewards. 2. Editors often invite unqualified reviewers just to speed up the process. This is common and even quietly encouraged internally, because hitting the target number of published papers is more important than ensuring proper peer review. If you don’t meet your quota, your supervisor will scold or pressure you. 3. If a paper is about to be rejected, the journal may force the handling editor to reassign the academic editor again and again — until someone finally accepts it. This is done purely to boost numbers and revenue. I couldn’t believe a Q1 journal would allow this — but it happens. 4. There is a clear element of racial or regional bias in the process. Manuscripts from authors in developing countries are often rejected without peer review. This isn’t just unethical — it’s heartbreaking. The assumption is that authors from these countries can’t afford the APC, so their work is dismissed outright. Meanwhile, submissions from developed countries are more likely to be reviewed, simply because “they can afford to pay.” These are only a few of the problems happening behind the scenes of so-called Q1 journals. So I ask: Can we still trust that a paper published in a Q1 journal truly represents academic quality?",Examination,Medium,1.0,web:pullpush:r/academia:submission:problem,Medium,1,2104,346,5,MDPI is problematic — even Q1 journals can’t guarantee quality.,0

"I was in nearly your exact situation going into my sophomore year (pretty much down to the dollar amount as well). My advice - obvious but fill out fafsa You may receive grant funding if you are lucky but worst case you will definitely qualify for some federal loans which have better rates and accrue little to no interest while you’re in school. Also scour for any and all scholarships from your school. There will likely be some for transfers. Also continue to look for them constantly as many schools offer more to junior and senior students. Talk to your financial aid office as there are usually scholarships that don’t even get filled because people don’t know about them. With your grades you should be able to find something and any $ helps greatly, even a few hundred bucks. Finally - do not be afraid to spend this money you have saved. I came into my sophomore year with about $12k in savings and used that all on tuition and rent until I started to run out of money. I didn’t end up needing loans until my final year (at a cheap state school with ~half tuition covered in scholarships). I know it’s nice to have a healthy savings but it is way nicer to have minimal debt and you are young enough to make that money back (obviously don’t go completely broke -you should always have a safety net if possible). Work through school! It sucks but it will keep you afloat and delay loans as long as possible. I found working an on-campus job that allowed me to do homework on the clock was super helpful. Also continue your good saving habits through school. It is easy to get carried away with spending but try to keep things under control by minimizing food delivery and unnecessary clothing purchases. You are in way better shape than most people our age! and I will say that I do catch myself sometimes resenting my friends whose school is paid for but you will be so much more financial responsible, prepared for real life, and appreciative for what you have and what college offers because of it.

"Losing affiliation between MA and PhD (publishing). I'm finishing my MA this semester and am submitting a paper for publication. I hope to start a PhD next Fall at a different university.

"Sexual harassment and worse in class WhatsApp. I just had an absolutely disgusting experience with a group chat from one of my classes. For a little background, the group chat is all students, but it’s shared in blackboard and in class, the professor knows about it but isn’t in it, and the sole reason we have it is to discuss class/school topics. There are about 40 students in the class group chat. Tonight, 4 students, with their phone numbers and WhatsApp aliases shown to all, started bombing the group chat with absolutely despicable pictures and images, without warning. A few students were talking about math, and then suddenly these four students thought it was funny or something to send picture after picture and video after video of pornography, violent pornography, racist imagery, bestiality, gore, and so on. Hundreds of pictures and videos. A few examples: a man masturbating with the caption “sit on me”, a man sexually assaulting an animal, a video of a man being beheaded, a video of a woman being punched while performing sex acts, and that’s only to name a few. I am in utter shock and disbelief at the absolute stupidity and insanity of these students, and it’s deeply, deeply concerning that they would find it acceptable to share these things in a class group chat. Crazy thing is I’ve had other classes with them, their phone numbers are public, it could be so easily traced back to them. The other 40 students in the class chat were silent and a few left the chat.

"Has anybody ever in their college career experienced burn-out and taken time off for mental health? How did it help. First off, I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit to post this inquiry in. I'm currently not in graduate school but graduated from a combined undergrad/grad program (but considering graduate school again for another program) so since there isn't really a subreddit for that weird limbo area, I figured this might be a relevant place to post it in. Here's my story (warning: it's long! If you're on here procrastinating, maybe save it for another day :) ) It's taken a long time to articulate this, because I've been afraid to talk about it or even post it on online forums for the fear of people telling me ""you're doing so great in life"" and ""most people would wish they were in your situation"". The guilt coupled with my depression made my mental health even worse, but I'm at a stage where I am a little more confident about myself to talk about it now. I was a very ambitious high school student who loved learning and loved being a part of activities where people make real changes or have conversation that lead to action. I didn't have a stable high school life (kept moving, had to make new friends, get used to new schools and their course offerings), so I was very driven to get into a good college eager to actually learn and find meaningful lifelong friendships. I worked hard (maybe way too hard) and got pretty good (but could have done better) grades with average test scores. I had a very wide variety of interests, but to water it down to two main things, I loved listening to experiences and writing them down (hence why I wrote for the school newspaper and enjoyed journalism) and also loved science, especially chemistry and biology. I wanted to be a medical doctor to combine my love for human experiences and science, but also knew medicine was kind of a default choice for many, so I was open to figuring out my path in college rather than being fully decided. My vague game plan was to be a pre-med while majoring in some kind of an ethnic studies major. After not being accepted to my top school choices, I moved to another state to stay with family, which would still offer me in-state tuition. The only thing was, I planned to either go to the local community college or just stay at the school for two years to transfer. The majors I applied at other schools weren't offered and there wasn't much diversity, which was a bit of a priority for me as a minority. Anyway, I actually found out on summer orientation that I got into this health program at my school which was well known in the local area and considered prestigious and selective. I was nervous because this major is a pretty specific path and I didn't know if I was ready to decide by the age of 17 what I want to do for the rest of my life. But seeing my parents eager (although they usually don't pressure) and having doubts about my mental capacity and intelligence in being a medical doctor along with the fear of not having a viable plan B, I decided to stick to the program. Another thing that helped was after a year and a half of not making friends, I finally met some laid back, seemingly fun folks from my major who formed a little study group with me. and was starting to feel like I was belonging at school. But by the 3rd year when my official graduate level studies began, things started to change. My ""friends"" were becoming increasingly cold and aggressive. They'd put their own frustrations on me and when I'd try to help them with problems, they'd get angry when they weren't getting the right answers. They knew I liked being helpful, so when they needed notes or something when they had another appointment to go to, I'd give them mine. Eventually ""one appointment"" became 3-4 days of not showing up to class for weeks in a row and asking me for notes and homework became routine. In fact, one of my friends kept ""forgetting"" to do her homework and when I started turning it in early to have her not copy it, she'd say ""next time, don't turn it in early"". I started to become depressed since these graduate studies began. My grades went from a 4.0 in my first years to an increasingly dramatic fall after getting many B's and C's. I started to see a therapist, but I had no idea what to explain. I had mild depression and anxiety since I was young and other issues going on at home (family illnesses), that I focused on as well as telling her I was upset that my friendships weren't working out and that I was feeling lonely and isolated as a minority when what was a bigger thing here that I didn't articulate at the time was that, for the once very passionate and ambitious person I used to be, I wasn't feeling passionate at all and I was even considering taking a semester off, but couldn't bring myself to not graduate on time. I was trying to convince myself that passion isn't important and that I have to be realistic that every job gets boring, so my main priority should be on stability and money, based on what kind of an attitude I collected from my peers. I felt simultaneously bored but guilty, because I had a shining opportunity in front of me but I wasn't into what I was studying. Despite everything, I did go through all the motions of studying: pulling all-nighters, taking notes, trying to look for an internship. To note, an internship in my program is students working in the same environment, doing the same thing. The only pre-requisite employers were looking for was that you were an enrolled student at an accredited program. I had gone through e-mails, direct visits, manager calls and mock interview practice; 10x more than what other peers who got internships were doing. For my peers struggling alongside me, I volunteered to mention their names alongside mine in e-mails to managers, which I realize now is something nobody would have most likely done for me. Eventually, those peers got jobs, probably through their own efforts of contacting, while I struggled until my very last year trying to find one. I was burning out and losing sight of what I was doing. I was unable to answer ""what made you want to do your major?"" when people asked. In the beginning, it was something about my own experience with an autoimmune disease and my love biological sciences and passion to understand people's experiences, but with the lack of empathy from my friends and the insinuation that we were the smartest kids in school, I felt that what I was supposed to do wasn't to understand people viscerally but know that I have authority. Most people didn't even ask why I chose what I did because when they'd hear what I was doing; they'd just say things like ""you don't even have to worry about grad school like we all have to!"" or ""you'll be making money when you graduate while we'll be out here broke"". I'd pretend to laugh, but inside I'd get so much anxiety being reminded of my troubles finding an internship, my grades dropping and being with friends who weren't interested nor passionate about anything except one-upping each other on exams or graduating and showing off their degree to people. I started to join groups outside of my college to distract myself, volunteered a little or attended after class lectures, which made things more bearable. However, unfortunately, by just going to class/distracting myself, I wasn't seriously preparing for the reality of the real-world. I could find an internship, which was the biggest factor next to getting my degree for getting job prospects, and what I was also realizing was that my major was undergoing a shift where there were far too many graduates than there were jobs. Before, anybody could find a job and jobs were considered relatively ""cozy"", doable work schedules and good pay. But later, I was learning that this was no longer true and my classes and the classes to come are sort of the first ""guinea pig"" classes to experience the consequences of the shift. I enrolled in a dual-degree program, assuming it would widen my prospects, but after two classes, I realized it wasn't for me and that it probably wouldn't do much unless I really found an internship with some managerial role. It wasn't until my last year, which was a full year of practical experience in six different settings, that I kind of got a glimpse of the real world. I started working closer with faculty after one experience, and in fact had opportunities to give presentations related to my interests and was able to present them to the entire department. I started to gain a feeling that I was finally doing things meaningful to me and was excited about this more than ever. One of my professors even used one of my presentations (with my permission) in one of her own presentations as a visiting faculty member at another school. I expressed my enthusiasm to my main supervising professor and made initiatives to make some of his classes better. When the time came to ask for a letter of recommendation for a program I wanted to apply to my main professor flat out refused. I was shocked beyond belief and upset. When I asked him why, he said ""I didn't do anything special to deserve a letter of recommendation"". I take constructive criticism and my capabilities/weaknesses seriously, but he didn't give concrete evidence as to why he rejected to write me a letter. The other professor who used my presentation for her own said to me ""I would write you one, but I would have to mention several weaknesses, one being multi-tasking"". She cited a time I turned down to help her with something because I told her it coincided with a main activity my main supervising professor had me do. I tried to see what other kids in my class who seemed to get along better with professors were doing, to see what I was doing wrong, and many seemed to develop a rapport with professors that seemed like friendships: happy hours, helping them move in/out of stuff from their houses.you know, like friends do. I don't have a problem with that, I guess I never thought to do it because I never got along with my professors like that. But I guess that also illustrated that maybe I was stand-offish or not friendly? I don't know.I found another professor to write me an LOR from another science department who I had experience teaching with who really seemed to encourage me and make me feel like I'm good at what I'm doing, but since he was not directly associated with the practice areas of my major, his word didn't have much weight as much as the others. Ultimately, with the job ordeal going on in my major, the lack of faculty support, the lack of friends support (there's far more to my friend's advantage taking that would make this post longer than it already i) plus a family illness at home, I graduated with major depression and anxiety. My family was initially upset with me telling me I was being ungrateful, but when they would see the physical impact of my mental health plus watching me apply to a ton of jobs with no interview responses, and after confirming with family friends who were in the same field, they started advising me to take it easy. I've taken a long time off (maybe time I should have taken off during a semester at school) and in between done some remote volunteering, cared for my family member who is luckily recovering, applied to jobs, had my resume revised, gotten in touch with other faculty and old supervisors and have started to look at alternative pathways and while I'm still struggling to find a job, I think my health is improving now that I have some idea of an alternative game plan for me. However, I can't say my depression/anxiety is completely gone and still have trouble finding motivation. I'm taking a path that is different and sort of unprecedented than what my peers are doing and I'm filled with anxiety somedays thinking I will fail and uncertainty as I 100% don't know what I'm doing. I still have occasional trouble sleeping, difficulty being focused and organized, but everyday, I am trying to do a little something to get back into a routine with exercise, household chores, etc. After my long spiel here, I appreciate everybody who has taken the time to read this and was also wondering if any of you here have experienced burn-out or a situation similar to mine.

"What to do as a dry lab graduate student (transcriptomics). I recently started a Master’s where my project is on transcriptomics in a lab where everyone else is in wet lab. I don’t have any data to work with yet but I’ve been learning using R and learning more about bioinformatics in the meantime. I’m mostly WFH just because I’m more productive having 2 monitors than 1 little screen since I don’t have a lab monitor cause the lab doesn’t have a space for me to sit and work. Anw, background aside, it’s been taking me a long time to learn R and analysing transcriptomics data I found online because I’ve never done any coding before or worked in genomics ever. I was in chemistry before this lol. I had a meeting yesterday with my PI and he essentially said that once I get the data I should be done analysing it within 2 weeks but like, it’s taking me 4+ months to barely understand the tools so idk how that’s going to go once I have my own data. But would it really take just 2 weeks? I think I’m the first purely dry lab person in the lab so it does seem like my PI doesn’t quite know what to do with me and since I’m in a whole new field where I feel like I’m constantly overwhelmed with essentially learning a whole undergrad program in 4 months after taking a gap year, I don’t know what to do or expect or even what do other people doing dry lab transcriptomics even do during their graduate studies?",Faculty,Low,0.0,web:reddit:r/gradschool:new,Low,0,1411,269,6,What to do as a dry lab graduate student (transcriptomics).,0

"How to get better at listening comprehension. I'm starting college in the fall and lately what preoccupies me is that I am awful at hearing without subtitles. This isn't due to any medical reason (my hearing works perfectly at my annual physicals), but probably because English isn't the predominant language spoken at my home and when watching things with my parents we always have subtitles on. At my high school my teachers didn't put anything on their exams that wasn't in the slides or textbook, so this wasn't a problem. But I've heard that in college sometimes the instructor will say things that aren't written down anywhere and we'll have to know those things for quizzes and tests. So I'm scared that I'll completely miss those parts and it'll ruin my understanding of the material and subsequently my grades. I've tried to practice by turning off subtitles when I watch YouTube videos and I'm starting to understand more and more, but YouTubers kind of have to speak clearly since it's part of their job; when I go shopping or out to eat I'm still having trouble understanding what the cashiers and wait staff are saying and I frequently have to be the person who says ""huh"" and finally settles on smiling awkwardly.

This is my first time on this subreddit, and it's due to a problem that has haunted me since I arrived at university as a scholarship student. I have a dilemma with myself and a lack of confidence, so I would like some outside opinions on the subject. During registration, I had, shall we say, a few problems that I considered childish, but which ultimately cost me three months' delay. To make matters worse, I'm enrolled in a computer science degree, so these were crucial months that I couldn't keep up with. When I went back to school, I was completely lost, and not being very sociable, I tried to manage on my own, but to no avail. On top of that, my computer no longer loads, preventing me at least from accessing the courses at home. I don't have the means to repair it either, as you need a working computer to retrieve the courses, from what I've seen. But what made it impossible for me was that I started skipping classes.

"Do you guys think it's worth it to go to college in another country. Bit of a wall text, please bear with it. I don't know why, but I always wanted to go to college in the US, and that became a somewhat real possibility after an exchange program. I had to take the ACT during my time in an American High School and did quite well, so I've been contacted by some Universities. But when I seriously started looking into it, I realized it might not be worth it. Main thing is the money, obviously. My parents and I are well off, mostly because of my dad's money managing abilities, and while we have talked about it and he's not sending me anywhere without being sure he can afford it (with the help of many scholarships), I'm starting to think it might not be worth it unless I get full scholarship, which is unlikely. It's just too much money. However, the situation of higher education in my country is in such a state that my dad has stated many times he feels the best move would be to go to another country. I'm Brazilian, and while our best Universities are free, they face a lot of strikes which delay studies for one, even two years at a time. They're also not very good compared to colleges in other places, which is another reason why he thinks I should go out of the country if I have the chance. To add to my indecision, there are very few colleges I would go to here in Brazil, but they exist. I'm going for a Engineering major, and while it would be hard to get into the place I'm thinking of (you need to pass an extremely hard entrance exam, and each college has a different one), I'm confident enough I could get into it next year.

"Asking for advice - Aspiring conflict, disaster &amp; collective memory studies. Hi everyone, a tl;dr summary to start off: \- Passionate about studying intergenerational effects of conflict and disaster, agency of immediately impacted, and collective memory. \- Background: BA in Archaeology/Anthropology + psychology lab internship + ongoing conscription. \- Seeking advice for career path and just about anything related to deepen relevant skills. The title says it all really, I’ve been passionate about studying the indirect and inter/transgenerational effects of armed conflicts, natural disasters, and other forms of catastrophic events on a given community deep down at a personal level &amp; would love to hear about degrees and other opportunities that would best train me for the task. As for my background, I have an undergraduate in Archaeology and Anthropology at a British institution &amp; am currently a conscript at my home country’s mandatory service scheme. In between the two, I briefly worked as an intern at a counseling psychology lab in my country to understand the psychological thoughts &amp; approach towards trauma, which I thought would be crucial for my research interest. Throughout my degree &amp; conscription I’ve tried to make my experiences aligned to it too, and geared my module choices, dissertation and current task to as relevant as possible. A particular area I’ve tried to draw connection with so far is memory studies &amp; collective trauma, albeit being aware of its issues and seeking to complement it from other angles too hence. With my conscription finishing in early September, I’ve been in the lookout for a postgrad programme to build methodological &amp; theoretical rigour. But I would really appreciate any advice on other research opportunities and career paths if they align with these interests. If you have experience in these areas, or insights on scholars &amp; institutions that offer strong training in my interests (conflict/disaster aftermath research, inter/transgenerational analysis, agency of the directly affected, collective memory) I’d really appreciate any &amp; all of your input.

"For both of those occupations youd have to complete a training program for a certain amount of time, and be 17+ usually.

If you think youd have the time to study for either, while you're in school now, I say do it, so that by the time you graduate, you can start working as either or.

"Is it dumb of me to not take advantage of AI. I think it really depends. In grad school, it’s important to be able to critically analyze scholarly research. You should be able to scan quickly for the main points, understand gaps or flaws in the methods, and be able to build upon what you have read and ask thoughtful questions about it. So if you let AI summarize everything for you, all the time, you’re not learning as much as you otherwise would. I do use it for this purpose but I’m discerning about it. I often use it on bad brain days or only to summarize after I’ve skimmed through the article myself and want deeper context. When it comes to brainstorming, I use it like a second brain. I give it the assignment information, my ideas and plans, and I let it poke some holes and build on my ideas. I also sometimes let it rework how I word something, assess my grammar choices etc. I do not use it to write or code entire assignments or copy-pasta the output it gives me. You’d be doing yourself a disservice there. Also, if you’re worried about cheating, using it the way I’ve outlined above is virtually undetectable.

"Being in academia is not worth it for me (biomedicine). So this is my personal view that I will justify. Everybody in academia (msc, phd, post docs mostly) is a proud slave. Working lots of hours for very few money in return. Passion is not the equivalent of a decent salary. The whole system is broken. You submit a journal and the comments may return in a period of holidays. Since all that is international somebody's holidays could not be your holidays. The deadlines are strict (10 days or so unless major revisions are required and even so, the prof will be hasty and you know that) Then you pay to publish (because from when I started to publish 7-8 years ago there where much more free journals but now most of them have a fee). And despite paying you have to fix every little detail to be in accordance with the format. This could be hours of silly work. Then you get the reviewers. One could suggest minor revisions and other could reject it outright. In a paper of mine one was asking me to include a table and when I did the other reviewer wanted to remove the table and was blaming me for having the results twice (as a figure and a table). Then you publish, so what? You make a tiny little contribution to research. Your paper will stop being cited because when a review or other paper is made you want the most recent literature so a 2015 paper in 2024 will get you a comment ""it seems that 50% of your reference are more than 5 years old"". As a post doc you can be with an 1 year contract (same goes for phds) with the potential of it getting renewed. So you're always insecure about the outcomes. And although we know that sometimes a drug that doesn't do anything against cancer (for instance) is a useful knowledge so others won't test the same drug for the same thing, you just can't publish that and your research is considered fail and your position can be jeopardized. If you spend the same amount of time in a pharmaceutical company or in a diagnostic laboratory you will earn way more, you will be treated as a proper employee with your regular leaves etc and with less work. I was working until this month in academia while knowing all these but i just wanted some experience in research. But whoever has asked my mind, I advise against a phd most of the times.

"I’ve served on a lot of these councils/hearings through the years. Here are my two cents: You should research your university and department policies on academic misconduct. Some have a zero tolerance policy for cheating and/or plagiarism. (Not intending to scare you, but it may inform how your hearing will go.) I have seen dismissals from programs (but not full expulsion) for this. Scholarships may also be dismissed. If they have no such policy, I’d say it’s likely you will receive an F, and academic probation, which will probably last a semester or year. Double check if your university publishes “good standing” on your transcripts. Where I work, every semester will indicate whether you are in “good standing,” “probation,” or “poor standing.” This could be far more damaging to your internship and career prospects as it almost always warrants an explanation. As far as other affects go… was this a hard course? Is it common to see people fail? (In my field, organic chemistry results in many F’s, so seeing retakes is common, and as long as the student does well the second time… it is not really a red flag.) If this was an “easy A” course, you may have more explaining to do. It can also delay program progress if it was a prerequisite for other classes. Some universities will drop an F when courses are taken for a second time. Instead the grade may say “R” for retake. That would be the best scenario. I’m sure you’re feeling a bit down about your choices, but as someone who has been in higher Ed for 10+ years, you may need to here this: cheating never benefits anyone in the long term. It pressures others to do the same (when practiced openly), can screw up grading scales/curves, and indicates that the cheater never really learned the material. This can impact your job performance down the line, when you realize you don’t actually have the skills needed to do well. It’s a tough lesson to learn, but perhaps best it happened early. Fight like hell to prove this is not who you are, and really make an effort to learn from this experience.

"Yeah, no. $72,000 for a bachelor's degree is never worth it. I would check with your school and see if they have some sort of scholarship portal, but usually those scholarships are for current students. Reach out to financial aid and see what your options are, also. Can you work over the summer to offset the costs? If you can make 8-10 grand over that time, which I know will be difficult, that could make going to the university a lot more viable. There's also payment plans that you can utilize if you are interested in working during the school year.

For the last several years I've worked seasonally for federal agencies, bopping around different parts of the US. I spent this time emailing PIs and trying to land an offer for a master's program to the point that I gave up and started seriously thinking about finding a permanent job, settling in with my partner, and saving for a house/living closer to family/thinking about kids/etc. Now that I've moved on, I have a fully funded graduate school opportunity. I'm lucky. I wanted this so badly, but the offer would require living nowhere near my prior homes or any of my previous communities, and would be far from my partner's workplace (across the country).

"Professor doesn’t know how to teach course, should I drop. Hi guys, I tried to post this in r/college but it was removed and someone suggested I post here instead: Hi everyone, I’m 21(F) and graduated with my BS last semester, but am currently finishing up my pre-reqs for pharmacy school at my local community college. I preface with this to say that I understand difficult professors, I have had many of them, but I think this situation is a bit different and I’m not sure what to do. I’m in a class right now where the professor was just hired the week before classes started. The course is very structured, the department sets the schedule, and all the labs, lectures, exams, quizzes, and assignments are the same for all the different sections with all the different professors. The thing is, this professor seems to have absolutely no idea what is going on, and is making zero effort to understand. We had a lab the other day and the assignment said that he should grade our slides in the lab before turning in the report. When I asked him to grade my slide, he looked at me as if I had three heads and said that we just fill out the report provided to us… when this is exactly what the report said to do. I’m not sure he even looked at the assignment in the first place. Class started January 26th, we don’t have the syllabus still, only got the lecture schedule yesterday, through which I found out we have an examination and lab quiz on Monday. Again, he did not mention this at all, and honestly, I’m not even sure he knows the examination is on Monday. He admitted last lab that he hasn’t familiarized himself with the lab schedule, even though we are 3 weeks in. Were supposed to have assignments online through Pearson, which were supposed to start at the beginning of the semester, but he has no idea how to set the Pearson course up and still hasn’t figured it out, which is crazy to me considering our first examination is on Monday. I’m really worried that I will not pass this class due to this professor, not because of my own skills. I’ve passed organic chem, physics, etc with good grades and now that I’m so close to finishing my pre requisites, I don’t want to risk a bad grade over a professor. The deadline to drop without a W is coming up in a couple days, and I’m really conflicted. I’ve only ever withdrawn from a course once, and that’s because I was struggling.

Basically I've had some interest, but have not really been able to get past the first zoom interview round for TT jobs. I had a campus interview for a long term VAP at a prestigious SLAC last year but narrowly missed out bc the chosen candidate specialized in a subfield they really needed since another faculty member retired. It's looking like another bust of a year, although I'm still applying for VAPs and postdocs. In the meantime I am in a string of less sexy contingent positions find myself getting more and more depressed. I had a stable lectureship last year that had me employed almost full time, but with enough time to do a little writing. However that university did a hiring freeze for lecturers, so I had to pivot and apply for fall semester pools last minute. I landed a few courses at a cc as an emergency hire. It's in an adjacent field teaching a super basic gen Ed subject, so not exactly ideal, but at least it helps pay the bills. That started out ok, but my assigned evaluator had some sort of personal vendetta against PhDs and decided to make my life miserable. (Other colleagues who were told about the situation felt the evaluator's behavior to be strange and unfair.) After that, I felt I couldn't really trust anyone at the new college. On top of that one of my courses was cancelled this semester. Basically I'm super under-employed, I feel like I can't trust people at the job I do have, and I'm starting to feel really depressed about the future. Basically, I finished my PhD with a strong research agenda and some promising works in progress, but I am now really struggling to keep it up. My current job has no access to research resources, so I've been trying to do research on off days at a local R1 library nearby while also juggling my academics job search and trying to present at conferences so I keep my name out there, which has at least helped my network grow. I've also been trying to research other career paths bc I just don't know if I can take the adjuncting thing for long. I am getting more depressed and struggling to focus, which means my research suffers and I feel myself growing more and more bitter about it all. (My field is so small that I'm competing with friends for things and while I am happy when anyone gets an interview, it's really hard not to feel like there's something wrong with me.) I think all of the political uncertainty surrounding higher Ed in general and the humanities specifically is probably not helping. For those who have felt like you were at rock bottom, did it get better? And if so, how did you snap yourself out of it?

"A Lot of Students Have Really Declined. I hope I don't sound like those ""holier than thou"" profs, but I need to say this: COVID has really made some students get lazy and more entitled. I am an undergraduate myself, and I have been TAing for four semesters now. Most of my students are great or they don't cause any problems. But this semester I definitely had a few bad apples. For context, I TA general physics classes meant for biology and chemistry majors. I try to understand that taking a physics class after lots of biology can be challenging for them and they do not know as much math, and I try to be cognizant of their situation, but some of the behaviors and excuses I have seen are just completely ridiculous. One student did not know how to use the chain rule when a semester of calculus 1 is a prerequisite and then complained how unfair it was they have to know how to take derivatives. I explained that yes they need to know how to do derivatives as that's a prereq for this course and it is their responsibility to review those derivative rules if they feel like they need to brush up. Another student got a question completely wrong, so I explained the correct answer and why they were wrong and they said ""Yeah obviously we know that; we're not stupid."" They then proceeded to call me rude and condescending for correcting their mistake. I even asked how they felt I could be more conscious while correcting them and the student couldn't tell me anything. A student gave me a very low score in TA evaluations because they felt it was unfair that they have to solve the workshop problems themselves and that I should be doing them on the board for everyone (yes someone actually said this). I decided to write more setups and important concepts and equations on the board to help, but some students called me lazy and distant for only doing this because ""he doesn't want to do the work."" This is the one that takes the cake though. I had to grade their participation in workshop. The professor told the TAs to have 5 out of 10 points for just attending and the other 5 points for how much they participated. This one group of students did not participate that much, so I did not give them 10/10 on their workshop grade. They emailed me saying how they feel that my grade for them was so unfair. I did not have much faith in how much work they did, so I wanted to see if they could back it up, so I told them I would raise their grades if they could show me written work for the workshops and gave them a deadline. Most of the group followed through, and i raised their grades accordingly. Then they responded saying how they feel that it is so ""hurtful"" that I didn't raise their grades even more. One student did not make the deadline and emailed me a day after, and I just said ""No I'm sorry. You were late, so I will not be raising your grade,"" and then I got a nasty email after that as well. While most students I work with are great, I keep seeing an increase in this ridiculous entitled behavior, and this is ridiculous. Is anyone else seeing this, or does this seem to only be a problem at my college? Edit: For the comments describing how COVID has been very rough for them, I can sympathize. COVID has definitely affected many students negatively and caused them struggle. Most profs and TAs are aware of this. That said, I think it is best to email profs and TAs and explain your situation and explain the ways you need support, not make entitled demands and not put in any kind of effort. Many students have constructively talked to me about this, and we were able to find a solution. But if you just use COVID as an end all be all excuse, especially for poor behavior, I'm not going to have a lot of sympathy for you",Faculty,High,2.0,web:reddit:r/college:search:unfair grading,High,2,3747,701,6,A Lot of Students Have Really Declined.,0
"Advice-seeking/venting: Is it worth sticking through if I don't want to stay in academia. The TL;DR is I don't want to stay in academia after grad school and I constantly think that I'm in the wrong field/should be doing something that makes me more fulfilled. So whether you stuck it out or not: is it worth it to finish the PhD if you didn't use it? This might be a bit rambling, but there are several factors at play (as there are for most people who consider dropping out of grad school). I go to a pretty good school for my chemistry PhD program, which means that it's got the I-don't-care-about-individuals-among-a-big-research-institution vibe. I joined one of the ""best"" groups in that it's small, people are generally friendly, and my PI isn't totally terrible. I guess the root of the problem is mentorship, or lack thereof. I'm part of a larger project team which isn't very organized in how the work is divided, and that's kind of left me in the dust. Since my program has me taking classes, TAing, and starting research from the beginning, everyone knows it's hard to start work in lab and usually older grad students mentor new ones to let them shadow and train. Altogether, I received maybe a week or two's worth of disparate training, spread over the course of 6 months - *not* a great way to feel like I've got the hang of things and can start anything on my own. The grad student that I thought would be my mentor basically stopped communicating her schedule to keep me from shadowing and learning from her, and whenever I got a day in to work on something she would explain things as if I didn't know what the instrument did or how it worked. It just felt condescending and hurt my confidence/hope to connect with her as a mentor. Now it's the end of my first year, and since the pandemic started I haven't been able to go into lab at all - even if I could, I don't think I'm trained enough to run many things on my own. My PI expects me to complete several unrelated projects that no one in the group has experience in, making it that much harder to dive in and start the research. At this rate, I don't think I'll be ready to pass a qualifying exam in a year. The problem is that I wasn't the only new grad student and the other guy got ""lucky"" in the sense that he's mentored by the most senior grad student who spent all their time showing him the ropes. He has constant streams of data and tons of experience with someone watching over him, and I have someone who has indicated to me that she doesn't think I'm worth her time to train. On top of that, I just don't think I care about this aspect of chemistry as much as I thought I did initially. I always had the problem of feeling insecure in chemistry labs because I'm not cut-throat about publishing, I'm not going to act like I know better than everyone else, and I never quite fit into the culture. My passions had changed before really committing to grad school, and I want to pursue more environmental/outdoor education work (which I have experience in through side jobs in undergrad). So part of me now is feeling extra discouraged, and I've had the recurring thought of ""Why am I still here? Is it worth staying if I don't exactly want to use the degree later on?"" If I could get a different job now, well, should I? I feel pressured to stay for so many reasons. I'm a first gen student, and the first to pursue a PhD in my family. It's stable income. I have close friends in the department. I'm not sure if this is just because of the pandemic and wanting to be more involved in activism/BLM. Here's a complication too: I'm stubborn, and I would also feel resounding guilt for not trying to stick it out in the ""white man's world"" as a friend of mine put it. My school/department has very few other POC, queer, and low SES students, and I kept pushing because I was made to believe that this isn't something people like me should do. I wanted to prove them wrong, but to do it in this environment is just so crushing. So do I hold out hope that it'll get better, or will I get leaked out from the pipeline like so many others before me? I've lost hope that I'll stay in academia and ""change it from the inside"" so to speak, because the way it is now, the institution just doesn't give a shit about the human part of scientists.

After the lecture, you can literally chat with your notes, ask it ""what did the professor say about mitosis?"" or ""summarize the section on market equilibrium"", and it gives you answers based on what was actually said. It works with more than just recordings, too. Throw in a PDF of your textbook, photos of whiteboard notes, or a video lecture, and it'll analyze all of it.

"How do I get through the rest of college as a student with severe ADHD and have done everything my school offers. I (20f) am going into my third year of University and honestly I do not know how I am going into my Junior year. School has always been extremely hard for me. I was diagnosed with ADHD in elementary school at the time where my school honestly did not know what to do with my diagnosis. I was a guineapig to my school on what to do with students who have ADHD. Therefor, I never really got the help I needed throughout my school years and struggled immensely. Somehow, I got into college. I was so excited because I was promised that school would get easier because I could choose the classes I liked and could focus in as well as the professors. Well, that promise fell through quickly. Since coming to university, I have gone through countless counselors, academic advisors, meetings, tutors, etc. Out of the entire campus, it seems no one knows what to do with me. I have done countless trials of different accommodations, tutoring and writing centers. Every time I would walk into a counselors office and tell them what I have done to try and bring up my grades or study my butt off to pass an exam they have always looked dumbfounded. I was on a sports team for a brief period and was called into an athletic academic counselors office to talk about my grades decreasing. When I sat down and told her everything I had been doing and started to cry out of frustration she looked at me and said, ""I'm sorry but there is nothing I can do to help. You're doing everything right so I don't know what is wrong"". Wow. Thank you. That helps so much. My issue is my attention span. I could sit in the library for hours to try to get homework done and yet only get not even halfway done with one assignment. My brain is constantly wandering even on medication. Yes the medication helps me to focus somewhat but unfortunately makes me hyperfocus on the wrong things. I have tried every space possible in the library. I cannot work at my apartment because it is too distracting. I have tried working in classrooms, nope. Counselors office? nope. Every possible space on campus, I can never seem to focus. What's worse? My professors constantly tell me how I am a wonderful student but my work does not reflect it. Oh how much I have heard that throughout the years. I've tried seeking help through my favorite professors, still not enough. My major is fairly easy as well. I am an Art Therapy major with a minor in Criminal Justice. Both of my favorite interests. I just do not know what is wrong with me. Maybe I'm in the wrong major? But I love it so much in class. I just get so distracted and forget so easily. For those wondering, I have discussed this with both my therapist and doctor. I was told that I could up my dosage in my ADHD medication but I do not want to do that because already it lasts so long throughout the day and has bad side effects. I do not want more of that. Please, if anyone with ADHD or if you know of someone who has ADHD, how did you do it? What do you do in this situation? How do you get through college when you are already so burnt out from trying your best and still failing.

"Most papers are a terrible presentation of scientific results - Change my mind. This is a bit of a pet peeve of mine and I am interested if this is something that other people agree with. But first a bit of background: I am a postdoc in bioinformatics. As a bioinformatician I have no strong ties to any particular research community and I read papers from medical, biological, statistical, biochemical, mathematical and computer scientific backgrounds. Each field and each subfield comes with their own landmark papers, jargon and notations. To me, reading papers is more difficult, because I am often not aware of many things that the authors take for granted. But in all fairness, I know that a lot of researchers are very deep inside their research subfield and people tend to know what certain notations and expressions mean. And that is fine with me. With this situation in mind, I still want to make the case for ""most papers are a terrible representation of scientific results"" because I feel that most papers impose an unnecessary burden on the readers. Let us first consider the purposes of a paper (according to my own understanding): &amp;#x200B; 1. Describe and present scientific results 2. Explain the motivation for the work 3. Explain how the results fit into the bigger picture &amp;#x200B; Let's talk about these in detail: &amp;#x200B; **1) Describe and present scientific results:** There is usually a main result that makes it into the title of the paper. The first figure (if there is one) often supports the main result. So far so good. But after that I feel that the Results sections tend to be just an agglomeration of additional pieces of results. A lot of details with numbers intermingled with text. For the reader it is very difficult to see what else could be of interest. It feels like people are trying to squeeze as many results as possible into the paper (or its suplement). In a similar fashion, many Material &amp; Methods sections are very unpleasant to read. A lot of these sections contain the description of procedures in prose form. I suppose that journals dislike lists in papers, but lists are actually the perfect stylistic element to represent procedures. Short list are also great for parameters for machines/software. Speaking of software: I find it very upsetting when the source code that produced the results is not available. As a programmer I prefer to read code instead of human-readable text. Simply because code is unambigious and contains all necessary details. The Discussion is usually the most readable part. It is where one can get a better idea about what the paper is actually about (if the abstract was not clear enough). The authors often emphasize the improvements over the state of the art in the beginning of this section. After that the reader might get lucky if the authors go on a tangent that is of interest to the reader. To me, this has been rarely the case. But I am probably not the primary audience in most cases. &amp;#x200B; **2) Explain the motivation for the work:** This part is about the ""why"" of the project. The motivation for the project is usually burried somewhere in the text and easy to overread. This might not seem like a big issue, but the decisions that the authors made while doing the project probably depended on that motivation and it is easier to understand a paper when the motivation is known. I think the motivation should be displayed more prominently on papers. &amp;#x200B; **3) Explain how the results fit into the bigger picture:** I guess most papers are fine in this regard. I suspect that people are afraid of not putting enough references into their papers ;) &amp;#x200B; \--- Do you agree/disagree?

"UK Help Me Choose. Hi all, I’m having trouble choosing a University. I’m going for a Design/Product design undergraduate course. See, I love Lincoln University and the area it’s in. The course is great too because they use Macs and Fusion360, which are two things I’m very experienced in. However, Lincoln doesn’t offer a placement year or the option to study abroad. I have a full offer with a guaranteed space for excellence or something like that.(Lincoln is ranked 2nd for product design and 55th in the UK.) On the other hand, Loughborough does offer a placement year and ranks 7th in the UK and 1st for product design. I don’t currently have an offer at Loughborough, but I expect to get one because I’ve got a strong personal statement, glowing reference from my tutor and distinctions all around the board. Another thing is that Lincoln is genuinely so beautiful and looks like a stunning and convenient (rail links) place to live. Loughborough looks painfully average and sort of boring and reminds me a lot of Stoke-on-Trent, which is where I’m coming coming from. The main benefit to the placement year is that it makes me more employable, so it’d be a great thing to have under my belt. But, Lincoln just grew on me so I’m seriously at wits end trying to decide which I prefer more",Placement & Career Services,Low,0.0,web:pullpush:r/university:submission:placement,Low,0,1293,228,17,UK Help Me Choose.,0

"Changing LOR Writers, But the Old LOR is My Committee Chair…. My former LOR writer for my doctoral applications was intended to be my research advisor for my current masters program. However, I had my 12/1 deadline come and go without hearing from them or having the letters in. To be forward thinking, I reached out to each of my schools asking about separate deadlines for writers, and was either told ’get them in as soon as possible or you risk being considered an incomplete application’ or ‘December 15th,’ today. Well, last week my chair tells me that the letters WERE submitted even though I didn’t get any email notifications and the portals hadn’t updated. I again reach out to the admissions for all the schools, and low and behold they all same the same thing of ‘those letters aren’t in’ along with some, who track it, saying ‘the status proves that the link hasn’t even been opened.’ I email him letting him know the first time I hear about this, and then the second time as a ‘I assume this is true for all of the applications and you’ll need to resubmit.’ I speak with a former advisee of theirs, and they tell me the equivalent of ‘oh he’s definitely lying‘ about having tried to submit them,‘ which, when paired with what the programs said, started to feel obvious. Still, I wait for a response from my advisor and I start to panic as last Saturday (12/13) rolls around and I’ve heard nothing from them. I speak to other people in my cohort, two professors, and that former advisee of my chair’s and they all recommend finding a new writer. So, I do - I write someone else on Saturday, we meet over Zoom, I explain the situation without naming names and they accept, they turn the letters in this morning (yes, I’m going to get them a gift basket). This morning, I send an email to my advisor telling them everything’s finalized and that they don’t need to do anything else and thanking them, and they email me back and ask for clarification. Now, I’m tasked with how to navigate telling them I got a new letter of recommendation writer. I really don’t know how to phrase an email like this while maintaining our relationship - I can’t just say ‘oh, it’s finalized because I didn’t trust you to write it so I asked someone else,’ but I also think not directly addressing WHY it’s finalized is a mistake.

"Absence/Sick Policy. Hi all. I am an adjunct teaching a small graduate-level seminar that meets in person once per week. The class meets for three hours and since it only meets once per week, missing one class means missing a lot of critical information. I am stuck on what kind of policy around absences I should have. It significantly affects their grades to miss even one class. I encourage students to join via zoom if they are sick (I just pull up the meeting on a laptop in the physical classroom), but it is still different than joining in person. Plus, not every sick student is up for even joining via zoom. I figure being sick should be an excused absence, but then I found myself in situations with students this year in which one would say they’re sick (and not join via zoom), and another give no reason (but did inform me right before class), and it seemed unfair to give the one student an excused absence when for all I know they were being dishonest. The reason I haven’t enforced a policy in the past surrounding make-up assignments for missing class is basically because I don’t want to have to do extra work (with how little I’m paid!) But in planning for next semester, I’m wondering if I should make a blanket policy that if you miss class for any reason (and even if you join via Zoom), you will need to complete an assignment to receive full attendance credit. Maybe it could be half credit if joined via Zoom. But I feel so bad taking off points when someone is legitimately sick and doing their best to join class.

"Yellow 👋 I use to be just like this for my first 1.5 years of Uni. Theirs no simple solution really, I was very shy in my first 2 years (I did a 4 Yr course with placement). I always had difficulty being friends with my flatmates, mostly because they were either all horrible - unclean or spoilt. Sitting In the kitchen, not a bad idea by any means. You mentioned hobbies, try to do 1 of them in the kitchen area, it's a starting point of conversation or simply gets people intrigued or go to the kitchen when people are cooking, and simply ask what their cooking - pretend not to know how to cook something and ask them etc. (Not always reliable). The thing that mostly worked for me, I have common ground with my class mates - I play games, play dnd, watch football and did Rowing. If possible, try to find where the main group of your course hang out or people you would like to talk the most. Whether thats a lounge area, a pub or what not. If you hear a conversation that you know about, try to gently jump in with your input. If not, it works before you enter a lecture hall - no doubt you hear something you know about. So try to jump in. My biggest trouble is here - when joining communities or clubs, like a film club etc. Have a look on your universities website, what ther is - reach out their leaders of the group, and ask to join or ask some questions.

UCD vs LMU. Hello!

"I am struggling to stay focused. TL DR: Got an extension on my major paper for capstone class due to COVID, and now I can't seem to get it done due to a demanding holiday environment and needy parents. Anyone have solutions? I don't know what the roadblock is. I love to write and research, and I just can't focus now that I'm at home. I got COVID in November and got an extension, but I need to have it done by the end of the year. Lots of different sections are completed and now it's just a matter of sitting down and putting them together. But I can't stay focused with family running around during the holidays. At my home, I can sit down and create a type of place that is filled with candles, blankets and lo-fi music. I have a dog, but no kids and no husband. For the holidays, my environment is filled with two older parents who talk in circles constantly (to themselves and each other, as well as to the dog, about everything and nothing) with the background noise of grocery bags, cabinets shutting, boxes moving around, complaints, and substitute curse words (hockey, shoot, dagnabit, etc). I don't have anywhere to go to escape it. And it is driving me crazy. I have had the boundaries talk multiple times, it just doesn't work. I come home 2-3 times a year surrendering all personal boundaries, and that is the only way to make my relationship work with my family. Also, I forgot my noise canceling headphones at home, and even if I wear headphones they will still talk to me. For tomorrow, my goal is to wake up at 5am to get some of this work done, and hopefully take a nap throughout the day so my patience panties stay in place. The last two days, if I even get a moment of silence because someone is off doing something, I'm overjoyed to let my headache subside and just sit in the quiet while I happily scroll through reddit/amazon/whatever for 10 minutes. I need to be working on this paper now but I just feel like maybe someone can think of something I haven't when it comes to noisy families. They have the best intentions, and love me so much, and that's why I continue to come home and give them love.

"How do I approach a potential PhD supervisor about what projects they might have available. Hi everyone, I am looking into potential PhD supervisors and have narrowed it down to a list that are actively advertising willingness to supervise students in my field. Most just say ""happy to supervise students in"" with a list of their specialties. The potential supervisors I've identified are in Wales, Australia, Canada, the US, England, and Scotland. I am in the UK for postgrad (student visa) and I was told that most of the time a PhD means you find a professor you click with and you help them with one of their projects, but now I'm not sure if that's true. My MSc program at my current university requires (or heavily encourages) that your thesis be on a topic and dataset that has already been identified by potential supervisors (I am in archaeology, so it can be a pain to find collections to use). Essentially what I'm asking is, will a PhD work the same way, or should I assume that these supervisors are seeking students starting from scratch?

"Professor keeps identifying me to the class as a “good student” and it’s getting uncomfortable. How do I address it. As an explanation, I’m in a medieval history course taught by a very old and old-fashioned professor (she’s in her 80s.) We’re in the third week of the course and it’s become pretty clear that not a lot of people are actually putting much effort into it. People openly sleep during the lecture, use their phones, don’t take notes, throw out joke answers to her questions, whatever. I think it’s mostly because the professor isn’t very authoritative and they just take advantage of that. She constantly mentions how rude and disrespectful it is during the lectures, but it gets worse every week. I don’t participate in any of the above at all and I’m consequently doing very well in the course. I take absolutely no credit for that; I write books with a medieval setting as a hobby and I’ve done so for years, so I’m helped along by a lot of knowledge I already had. And I’m the kind of person who was described by a professor last year as “impressively anal-retentive,” so my brain literally won’t let me check out of the class or do anything rude, otherwise I’ll be obsessing over it for weeks. I’m not special or gifted or anything, just a perfectionist. The problem is that she’s started to call me out in front of the class as being a good student, and it’s making me incredibly uncomfortable. Last week I gave an answer to a question that turned out to be wrong and realized right away where I’d gotten mixed up. Just before we went on a break, she mentioned people throwing out joke answers again, so I went up to her during the recess and asked to clarify where I’d gotten confused, since I didn’t want her to think I was joking around or not taking it seriously (since my answer was pretty dumb.) She responded by patting my shoulder and said “When I say those things, I’m never talking about you, my dear,” and then literally named me and four other students as “good.” She said their names and everything, including that one wasn’t as good as the rest of us but “he tries, and sometimes what he says makes sense.” It wasn’t in front of the class or anything, just to me, but other students were in the room and could hear us. I was horrified and had no idea how to respond. I know she’s frustrated with how people behave in the course, I would be too in her shoes, but this just didn’t seem appropriate and now I have no idea what to do. I already have trouble making friends on this campus because I work full time and don’t have a lot of time to party/go out, so being a teacher’s pet isn’t going to help.

"How Researchers Stay Current with New Papers and Developments. I wrote an article (based on survey with almost 40 respondents) on this specific topic! If you are interested please read: # Introduction In today's fast-paced world of scientific research, staying current with the latest developments and literature in one's field is paramount. Researchers who fail to keep abreast of new findings and advancements risk falling behind their peers, missing out on crucial insights, and potentially wasting time and resources on already-explored ideas. Staying up-to-date allows researchers to build upon existing knowledge, identify gaps in the current understanding, and develop innovative solutions to pressing problems. However, the sheer volume of scientific literature published each year poses significant challenges for researchers trying to stay informed. With countless journals, preprints, and conference proceedings to sift through, it can be overwhelming and time-consuming to identify the most relevant and impactful papers. Furthermore, the increasing specialization of research fields means that important developments may be scattered across multiple disciplines, making it even more difficult for researchers to have a comprehensive overview of their area of study. To better understand how researchers navigate these challenges, we surveyed participants about their strategies for staying current with the latest literature, their tools, and the obstacles. This article aims to synthesize the insights gained from these responses and provide an overview of the current landscape of scientific literature monitoring. By sharing the experiences and perspectives of researchers across various fields, we hope to foster a discussion on best practices and potential solutions to help researchers stay at the forefront of their disciplines. # Common Tools and Techniques Used by Researchers Staying up-to-date with the latest developments in one's field is crucial for researchers. To achieve this, they employ various tools and techniques that help them discover, filter, and organize relevant literature. Among the most popular tools are search engines like Google Scholar and Semantic Scholar, which allow researchers to search for papers using keywords, authors, or citations. These platforms provide access to a vast database of scholarly literature, making it easier for researchers to find relevant papers quickly. Preprint servers, such as arXiv, have become increasingly popular in recent years. These platforms allow researchers to share their work before it undergoes peer review and publication in a journal. By monitoring preprint servers, researchers can stay informed about the latest findings in their field and engage in discussions with their peers. Many researchers also rely on journal and conference alerts to stay updated. By subscribing to these alerts, they receive notifications when new papers are published in their areas of interest. This helps them save time by not manually searching for new publications. Personalized recommendations, such as those provided by Google Scholar alerts, have also become a valuable tool for researchers. These alerts notify users when new papers that match their interests are published, ensuring they don't miss out on important developments in their field. Social media and networking platforms have also become increasingly important for researchers. Twitter, for example, has become a popular platform for sharing and discussing new research findings. By following relevant hashtags and accounts, researchers can stay informed about the latest developments in their field and engage in discussions with their peers. Finally, collaboration with colleagues remains a crucial aspect of staying up-to-date with new developments. By attending conferences, participating in journal clubs, and engaging in discussions with their peers, researchers can learn about new findings and ideas that may not be available through other channels. # Challenges and Pain Points Staying on top of the latest research developments is a critical task for researchers, academics, and professionals across various fields. However, this process is fraught with numerous challenges and pain points that can hinder their ability to effectively navigate the ever-expanding landscape of scientific literature. Based on the insights gathered from the survey responses, four key issues emerge as the most significant hurdles: information overload and noise, paywalls, and access to papers, time constraints, and keeping up with interdisciplinary research. ## Information Overload and Noise One of the most prominent challenges highlighted by the respondents is the sheer volume of research papers published daily, leading to information overload. As one participant aptly put it, ""There is a lot of noise and least-publishable-units out there."" The rapid pace of publication across various fields makes it increasingly difficult for researchers to sift through the vast amount of available literature and identify the most relevant and high-quality papers in their areas of interest. Several respondents expressed their frustration with the high noise levels in their searches, with one stating, ""The noise level was high."" This sentiment is echoed by another participant who wished for ""fewer rubbishy papers!"" The presence of low-quality or irrelevant papers clutters the research landscape, making it harder for researchers to find the most valuable and impactful studies. To combat this issue, participants employ various strategies, such as relying on specific keywords, filtering by authors or publication venues, and utilizing tools like Google Scholar and arXiv. However, these methods are not always sufficient to cut through the noise effectively. As one respondent noted, ""It doesn't work very well even with specific keywords. I get better results when I search by author and then do further research based on analysis of bibliography of chosen article."" ## Paywalls and Access to Papers Another significant pain point identified by the respondents is the presence of paywalls and limited access to research papers. Many participants expressed their desire for a more open and accessible research ecosystem, with one stating, ""My magic trick would be all papers and journals publicly available. I have no problem reading and learning things. My real problem is when paying is required to access science and tools."" Paywalls pose a significant barrier for researchers, especially those affiliated with institutions that may not have subscriptions to all the relevant journals or databases. As one respondent shared, ""When I can't read a paper because is not open, most of the cases I am forced to read another source instead."" This limitation hinders researchers' ability to comprehensively review the literature and stay abreast of the latest developments in their fields. Some participants rely on their institutional affiliations to access paywalled content, while others resort to alternative sources or settle for reading abstracts and open-access papers. However, these workarounds are not ideal and can lead to an incomplete understanding of the research landscape. ## Time Constraints Time constraints emerge as another critical challenge for researchers trying to stay on top of the latest literature. With the fast-paced nature of research and the constant influx of new papers, finding the time to thoroughly review and digest the relevant studies can be a daunting task. Participants reported spending anywhere from a few minutes to several hours per day or week on staying updated with new research. One respondent noted, ""Around 20% of my time is spent on that. However, this is also because I am a reviewer for many of these venues."" The time commitment required to stay current can be substantial, especially for those with multiple research interests or responsibilities. To manage this challenge, some respondents have developed strategies such as setting aside dedicated time for reading papers, prioritizing based on relevance and quality, and relying on tools and alerts to streamline the process. However, the time investment remains a significant hurdle, with one participant stating, ""The most consuming part is to read and understand the paper. There are a lot of equations and prior knowledge required."" ## Keeping Up with Interdisciplinary Research As research becomes increasingly interdisciplinary, staying informed about developments in adjacent fields and understanding their potential implications for one's work presents a unique challenge. Participants acknowledged the importance of keeping up with interdisciplinary research but also highlighted the difficulties in doing so effectively. One respondent noted, ""Working with large ambiguities and uncertainties, and with a lack of previous developments and heritage, one must seek analogies in other fields and industries; recent as well as old papers."" This sentiment underscores the need for researchers to look beyond their immediate areas of expertise and explore connections with other disciplines. However, identifying and understanding relevant research from other fields can be time-consuming and complex. Participants reported using various strategies, such as attending conferences, engaging in discussions with colleagues from different backgrounds, and using tools like Google Scholar and Semantic Scholar to discover interdisciplinary connections. Despite these efforts, keeping up with interdisciplinary research remains a significant challenge. One respondent observed, ""It definitely was not the most efficient way to do this."" The lack of standardized keywords, differences in terminology, and the breadth of potentially relevant literature across disciplines can make it difficult for researchers to effectively navigate this landscape. In conclusion, the challenges and pain points identified by the survey respondents highlight the complex nature of staying on top of the latest research developments. Information overload and noise, paywalls and access limitations, time constraints, and the difficulties of keeping up with interdisciplinary research all contribute to the obstacles faced by researchers in their quest to remain current and informed. Addressing these challenges will require a multifaceted approach, including the development of more sophisticated tools for filtering and discovering relevant papers, the promotion of open access and the removal of paywalls, and the fostering of interdisciplinary collaboration and communication. By tackling these pain points head-on, the research community can work towards creating a more efficient, accessible, and effective system for staying on top of the latest developments in their fields. # Desired Improvements and Wishlist The survey responses reveal a strong desire among researchers for better tools and systems to help them stay on top of the latest developments in their fields. One of the most frequently mentioned improvements is the need for better categorization and filtering of papers. Researchers often find themselves overwhelmed by the sheer volume of new papers published each day, making it difficult to identify the most relevant and important studies. They express a wish for more accurate and specific filters that can help them narrow down their searches based on keywords, topics, or specific subfields. Some respondents even suggest the use of AI or machine learning algorithms to improve the relevance of search results and reduce the noise in the system. Another common theme in the responses is the desire for personalized recommendations based on individual research interests. Many researchers would like to see a system that can learn from their reading habits and preferences, and suggest new papers that are likely to be of interest to them. This could be achieved through the use of collaborative filtering algorithms, similar to those used by online retailers and streaming services. By analyzing the reading patterns of similar users, the system could make intelligent recommendations and help researchers discover new and relevant papers that they might have otherwise missed. In addition to personalized recommendations, many researchers also express a desire for summaries and digests of recent developments in their fields. With the rapid pace of scientific progress, it can be challenging to keep up with all the latest findings and breakthroughs. Researchers would appreciate a service that could provide them with concise summaries of the most important papers and developments, allowing them to quickly get up to speed on the latest research without having to read through dozens of individual papers. Some respondents even suggest the use of natural language processing techniques to automatically generate these summaries, saving researchers valuable time and effort. Another major pain point for researchers is the issue of access to scientific literature. Many respondents express frustration with the current system of paywalls and subscription fees, which can make it difficult or impossible to access important papers and studies. They would like to see a move towards open-access publishing, where all scientific literature is freely available to anyone who wants to read it. This would not only benefit individual researchers but also help to accelerate scientific progress by making it easier for researchers to build on each other's work and collaborate across institutions and disciplines. Finally, many researchers express a desire for better tools for managing and organizing the papers they read. With the vast amount of literature available, it can be challenging to keep track of all the papers that are relevant to one's research. Respondents mention using a variety of tools, such as reference management software like Zotero and Mendeley, but they would like to see more advanced features and integrations. For example, some researchers suggest the ability to automatically extract key information from papers, such as the main findings and methodologies, and store this information in a structured database for easy retrieval later on. Others would like to see better collaboration features, such as the ability to share and discuss papers with colleagues in real time. The survey responses reveal a clear need for better tools and systems to help researchers stay on top of the latest developments in their fields. From improved categorization and filtering of papers to personalized recommendations and summaries, to open-access publishing and better management tools, there are many areas where researchers would like to see improvements. By addressing these pain points and wishlist items, we can help accelerate scientific progress and make it easier for researchers to do their important work. # Importance of Staying Current for Different Groups Staying up-to-date with the latest research and developments is crucial for various groups, each with their own unique needs and motivations. Here, we discuss the importance of staying current for researchers, industry professionals, and journalists or science communicators. Researchers, including professors, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students, have a strong need to stay on top of recent literature in their respective fields. Professors and postdocs, especially those seeking tenure-track positions, must ensure their research is original and contributes to the advancement of their field. Graduate students, while often benefiting from the guidance of their supervisors, also need to stay informed about the latest developments to produce novel and impactful work. Regularly reviewing new publications allows researchers to identify gaps in knowledge, spark new ideas, and avoid duplicating efforts. Industry professionals, particularly those in research and development (R&amp;D) roles or working with cutting-edge technologies, must stay current to remain competitive and drive innovation within their organizations. By keeping abreast of the latest research, they can identify potential applications, anticipate future trends, and make informed decisions regarding product development and strategic planning. Staying up-to-date also enables industry professionals to collaborate effectively with academic researchers and incorporate state-of-the-art techniques into their work. Journalists and science communicators play a vital role in bridging the gap between the scientific community and the general public. To accurately report on scientific breakthroughs and convey complex concepts to a broad audience, they must have a solid understanding of the latest research. Staying current allows journalists to identify newsworthy findings, provide context, and ensure their reporting is correct. Science communicators who stay informed can also help combat the spread of misinformation by presenting accurate, up-to-date information in an accessible manner. # Conclusion In this article, we explored the various strategies and tools researchers employ to stay up-to-date with the latest developments in their respective fields. By analyzing the responses from a diverse group of academics and professionals, we identified several key points that highlight the importance of having an efficient and sustainable process for staying informed. Firstly, respondents emphasized the significance of regularly checking for new papers and publications, with frequencies ranging from daily to monthly. This underscores the need for researchers to allocate dedicated time to explore and digest new findings in their areas of expertise. Secondly, digital tools, such as Google Scholar, arXiv, and field-specific databases, emerged as a common theme, enabling researchers to streamline their literature searches and receive automated alerts for relevant content. However, the survey also revealed challenges and limitations in the current processes. Many respondents desire more advanced filtering and recommendation systems that could help them identify the most pertinent papers based on their specific interests and research questions. Additionally, the time-consuming nature of thoroughly reading and understanding new publications was highlighted as a significant hurdle, emphasizing the need for more efficient methods of extracting key insights. Developing a sustainable and efficient process for staying informed about recent developments is crucial for researchers to remain at the forefront of their fields. By adopting a combination of regular literature searches, targeted alerts, and collaborative knowledge-sharing within their networks, researchers can ensure they are well-equipped to contribute to the ongoing advancement of their disciplines. Looking to the future, there is significant potential for developing more sophisticated tools and techniques to support researchers in their quest to stay up-to-date. Integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms could enable more accurate and personalized recommendations. Advanced natural language processing techniques could help summarize key findings and identify novel connections between disparate research areas. Furthermore, the growing trend towards open-access publishing and the democratization of knowledge through online platforms may help to break down barriers and facilitate more rapid dissemination of new discoveries. In conclusion, staying on top of recent developments in one's field is an essential aspect of being a successful researcher. By continually refining their processes and embracing new technologies, researchers can ensure they remain at the cutting edge of their disciplines, driving innovation and contributing to the collective advancement of human knowledge. # Data Survey data is available [here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZRc1z81nzhN63Z-AIamM1l7nBUfLTQuBuSHYduvHx78/edit?usp=sharing) Use it as you wish, just let me know.Introduction Originally posted on: https://archeota.org/blog/posts/how-researchers-stay-current",Academic,Medium,1.0,reddit:r/academia,Medium,1,20092,2897,0,How Researchers Stay Current with New Papers and Developments.,0

"Things to Know Before Starting College By an Instructor. 1. Learn where your documents are saved, how to save them to other places, how to download them, upload them, email them, etc. Learn the difference between saving something to the cloud verses saving it to your physical computer. 2. Create a document naming system. I cannot tell you how many students upload the wrong file because they give them all generic names. A lot of them upload the assignment instructions they’ve downloaded since those instructions have the assignment name in the title. Come up with a way to label all of your documents so you can easily tell what is what, especially if you have multiple drafts of a project. 3. Read directions at least three times: 1) when you get them so you have time to ask questions; 2) when you start working so they’re fresh on your mind; 3) when you finish so you can double-check you didn’t overlook anything. 4. Your classes are often teaching you how a specific field operates. Your job is to show you understand the conventions of that field. This does not mean you are expected to agree with these conventions or that the conventions of that field work for all fields. 5. Learn basic email etiquette. Include a subject line that is specific (not something generic like “class”), and don’t keep replying to the same email for months on end; when you need to start a new conversation, start a new email. Do not send multiple emails rapid fire like you do while texting. State your class and class day/time in the email. 6. Check out student services and/or career services. You likely have access to tutoring, mental health resources, food pantries, interview training, help with resumes, etc. 8. You are responsible for knowing the course schedule and when assignments are due even if your instructor doesn’t remind you. If you miss class, you are responsible for coming to the next class prepared, even if you have an excused absence. Keep a calendar, use phone reminders, or otherwise set up some kind of system to keep track of due dates. 9. Google things! Does your instructor keep saying a word you don’t know? Google it. Do you not know where to find someone’s email address? Google how to find it. Do you have no idea what email etiquette is? Google. While it may not be perfect and while there certainly are other ways you can get information, Googling something will almost always be better than simply doing nothing because you’re confused. 10. Your instructors are people, and they will occasionally be forgetful, say something incorrect, etc. I see a lot of posts in other forums asking things like ""why would my instructor lie about giving me an extension"" or ""why would an instructor give us misinformation"" when the answer is usually that they forgot, mixed something up, or were otherwise just being human. If your instructor forgets something, send a reminder email. If they say something that doesn't sound right, ask for clarity. 11. I recommend getting any agreements in writing just in case your instructor does forget something. If you do request something verbally, you can follow up with an email saying you just want to confirm the conversation. 12. Know the chain of command when making a complaint. You almost always have to discuss the issue with your instructor first. And in my experience a lot of complains to the dean end up being misunderstandings that could have easily been clarified by talking with the instructor. 13. When you interact with your instructors, you are also showing them the kind of student you are. At some point in your academic career, there’s a good chance you are going to have to rely on their judgement of you. Maybe you need a recommendation letter. Maybe you’re sick on the day of a big test and need them to believe you when you explain why you missed. I’m not saying you should suck up to instructors, but you should keep this in mind when making decisions about how you interact with your instructors and fellow students, whether or not to attend class, etc",Faculty,Medium,1.0,reddit:r/college,Medium,1,4035,701,6,Things to Know Before Starting College By an Instructor.,0
"Feeling Very Overwhelmed or: Why does every class have to have a project. I am feeling very overwhelmed this semester. I am a third-year PhD student, and I have never been as busy as I am right now. Given everything else happening this year, this semester actually started off great. I started a well-paid fellowship and I scheduled my qualifying exam for the first two weeks of November. The fellowship is a 30-hour per week commitment, I am a TA with a 10-hour per week commitment, and my two classes basically each require me to read an entire book and write a 7 page paper every two weeks. Even with all of that, I had been able to stay on top of all of my work and get A's to A-'s on all of my assignments. However, things have finally started to pile up and I feel like I am drowning in work I will not be able to get done. Next week I am taking over teaching duties for the class I TA to teach the next unit, and one of my classes has a project due at the end of the month worth 35% of our grade. I haven't even looked at my slides for the unit I'm teaching yet (I taught the same unit last year), the project I planned for the class was way too overambitious, and I have absolutely no idea how I can get it done by the deadline. I know projects are a good way to apply course concepts into something relevant to my own research, but just one semester I would like to just have to worry about passing a final exam. My other class is not project-based and even though the two exams are worth 75% of my grade, I am not worried about them at all. On top of all this, my upstairs neighbors are insane, screaming at each-other almost 24/7, and physically abusive to each other. This makes it hard to focus while working from home, and I recently had to call the police on them after one of them pulled a knife on the other. Since we are their only downstairs neighbor they knew it was me who called and they started flipping out on me a few days later when I ran into them in the driveway. After this happened I talked to my landlord and got out of my lease, and now I am moving into a new apartment on November 30th. This has been the most stressful semester of my life, and I honestly have no idea how I am going to get through it. I've pushed back my qualifying exam date twice now (moved to January now), which has eased some of the stress, but with everything else I have to do, including packing up my apartment, I feel so overwhelmed that I can't even figure out where to start with anything during the day.

"U.S. student confused about U.K. uni applications and A levels, please help. Hello! I'm a student from the U.S. interested in studying in the U.K., one big bit of confusion I have is how exactly A level course requirements and stuff work for U.K. unis, from my understanding (and please elaborate with your knowledge!) A levels are the equivalent of Honors/Ap classes in the U.S. and the actual A level grades (A\*.&gt;F or whatever) are similar to 1-5 on an AP test. What I'm confused about is how these minimums work for U.K universities and how to apply and stuff. For example, I'm interested in studying Civil Engineering but a lot of the universities require a physics and math a level, problem is I'll be taking AP Physics and Calculus next year (senior year/last year of highschool) so I wont have the ap tests scores back.

Your expected to have your own deadlines and take responsibility. Partying every night is fun but the people who reach accidemic excellence don't party hard and expect to pass. 💥 In college there are alot of assessments. You will literally have to organize your life around them. Want to go to the college dance? No your not you have that 50% assignment due tomorrow. The assessments seem never ending, and they are. Until one day they are all but a dream. 💥Find a stimulant. Now some days you might be pulling your hair out over some crazy 50 page assignment for 40% of the mark. Then it dawn's on you, that you only have a week left before the due date. Stimulant's like coffee are your friend here. If you have to pull all nighters to get that assignment done do it. (It's not like have a life outside of college) just remember to take quick naps, breaks and lots of snacks to keep your energy up. 💥 If your school has a reliable organised online portal sometimes it's okay to skip a class especially if a deadline is coming up. Skipping a class or two may be essential to both your accidemic potential or your Mental health. If you need to skip class do it. Get your classmate to write some notes for you, or check out the study guide on your universities online portal in your own time. Your health is more important than school. (Note only skip non mandatory classes!) 💥 Your university has learning assistants, you pay for. Use the hell out of them. You pay for a learning assistant. You can send them work to check spelling grammar and referencing. Some can even be specific to the subject and can act as a secondary tutor. 💥 University is fun Have fun at university and make friends. You may have to pull all nighters studying but try and keep a balance. 💥 Don't panic over one bad grade. You can always try better next time. Try again or even just celebrate your mediocre grade if it was a hard subject for you. You are not your grades.

"A Miracle Harvard Acceptance. ***This will take a little while to read. This post is not intended to be cruel, but rather to present a realistic picture of top-tier admissions to prospective undergraduates. To address the holier than thou tone that will undoubtedly be present in this post, I'll preface this by saying that I was rejected from two Ivy League schools (Harvard &amp; UPenn), as well as UMich, Georgetown, and Tufts.*** Alright, enough about me. Let's get to you. Based on the demographics of this sub, I'll take a very rough guess that you are a 17 or 18-year-old middle-upper class white male. You have very competitive stats, hold multiple leadership roles in organizations at your school, wrote well thought out essays, and received glowing LORs. Most other kids from your hometown do not compare to you scholastically. In other words? You kicked ass in high school. It's your senior year, and you applied to a number of highly selective undergraduate schools. In light of recent ~~rejections~~ events, a growing number of posts have been made on this forum disparaging the inequities present within the college admissions process. Complaints about affirmative action far outnumber critiques of any other system. The implication is that race allows underqualified applicants to gain admission to elite institutions over more deserving, non-minority students. This is an extreme oversimplification and shows a fundamental lack of understanding of the admissions process. In an effort to remedy this, I'm taking you on a trip to Cambridge, Massachusetts. *It's a cold January day here, and flurries are starting to sprinkle. I just finished a slice of cheese at Pinocchio's, a charming pizza place where Mark Zuckerburg used to do CS problem sets. Head outside and turn down Brattle Street, and you end up at the Office of Undergraduate Admissions for Harvard. Inside, your application is currently being considered along with two others for two spots in the incoming Freshman class.* **Alright, sorry to break the immersion, but I feel the need to say that I understand that this is not close to how admissions decisions are actually made. But I feel that this hypothetical allows the whole picture to become more clear.** *Where were we? Right. Three applicants. Two spots. Let's meet your peers.* *Three kids. There's one female, URM. Dirt poor. Slightly lower stats than you. There's you, middle-class male, white. Then there's one ultra-rich white male. Legacy. Lowest stats of the bunch, but only because of a poor freshman year. Everyone has comparable ECs, strong essays, LORs, etc.* *So (cue opening scene of ""The Social Network""); ""How do you distinguish yourself in a population of people who all got 1600s on their SATs?""* *Simple. You need a differentiating factor. In your high school bubble, you were the best. To cut it here? You need to be the best of the best.* *When those kids walk onto campus for orientation, they will be at one of the most selective institutions in the world. The students around them are all exceptional in different ways. The rich kid has a dad with a $50 million net worth. The URM chick got a perfect SAT score and a 4.0 from a one bedroom house smaller than your kitchen. Look to your left, there's Malia Obama. To your right, Yara Shahidi.* ***This is your competition.*** ""Wait. These kids are special cases! What about the normal ones?"" *Harvard offered 1962 people a spot in the incoming freshman class this year. Now, you're right. Malia &amp; Yara are celebrities. They are a special case. Still, let's say two more celebrities applied this year. That's two spots gone. 1960 left. Roughly 30% of the class will be legacy students. That's 589 more spots off the list. 1371 left. 200 more will go to athletes. 1171 left. 10 go to faculty kids, 3 more to members of various royal families, and one to a kid whose last name is on a building. You see what I'm getting at?* ***Everyone is a special case.*** *Year after year, people ask for ""Miracle Acceptance Stories"" only to be shot down by seemingly wise commenters who simply state ""There are no miracle acceptances.""* *Those commenters are wrong. There are miracle acceptances. Want an example? Miracle acceptances to the most selective colleges in America are people like you. People who have stellar stats, strong extracurriculars, and eloquent essays, but no hook.* *You have gone through high school and constantly achieved at a level above and beyond your classmates. But here? In this cold room at 86 Brattle Street? You are something that you haven't been in a long time. Average. No, not an average admit. An average applicant.* *The two people you're competing against? They played the game. Expertly.* ""But that's not fair! I can't control the situation I was born into!"" *Nobody can! That's the whole point! The athlete gets good genetics, the legacy gets money, and the poor brown kid gets affirmative action! They understood their place. They recognized an imperfect process for what it is; imperfect!* *I've never seen someone post ""It's unfair that I didn't get into Stanford with a 1230! I'm a bad test taker!"" That would be absurd. We all know that high test scores are part of the deal for any top school. Bad at taking tests? Tough luck! Figure it out. Born a middle-class white kid? Know what is required. Adapt, or die. The cards you are dealt are not the end all be all, but knowing how to play them is.* *The accepted students? They knew their edge from the second they were born. Or they made their own. And they exploited it for everything it was worth.* ***You did not.*** *Dear You,* *The Committee on Admissions has completed its Regular Decision meetings, and I am very sorry to inform you that we cannot offer you admission to the Class of 2022.* *We very much appreciate the interest you have shown in Harvard, and we hope you will accept the best wishes of the Committee for success in all your future endeavors.* ***Edit: Thanks for the gold.

"Last month also my Birthday month was the lowest point in my life. Never knew so many thing's can happen within a month, but got injured in the back, had a surgery for it, couldn't go anywhere out of my house was in my room all day feeling anxious and depressed. But now the worst part start's, I don't have a huge friend circle, so I tried to reach out to my friend's regarding my depression, but they were busy out partying hitting on girl's and sending me thier chat's and n\*des of those girl's and apparently asking me to ""Enjoy this"". As I had a breakup in May this month, the wound was still fresh, I had no girl to talk to and my friends hangingout with so many girl's really peer pressured me into making some of the most deperate move's that now I realise I just regret, I texted nearly around 40 to 50 girls from my college hostel on Instagram in that month trying to make a convo, that time though I was so smart, I got left on seen or not even read by most of them, then I got Anxious and told my college roommate all this on call that my stupid head texted so many girl's and bro was flabbergasted, he said do you even realise in girl's hostel word spread's like a wild fire and now most of the girl's in the Hostel will know about how desperate you are and I was like bruh I never thought about this that way. Now I just feel so sad and mad at myself and I'm so ashamed to go back to hostel this week bruh. And this was just the tip of the iceberg, after getting sad and anxious, I texted my ex apparently, cause I was sad at night, I texted her a whole paragraph stating this "" I'm going through alot, It's such a rough phase for me, I thought you'd be free to talk about it because I was there for you always, I can't bear this anymore, Its just killing me, the pain from my surgery and this headache from all the anxiety I'm getting, I was getting anxious to text you, cause I thought you'd think why is this idiot texting me after breaking up, but please I really need you please!"" Yeah Idk what I was on that night, woke up in the morning to being left on seen by her and then she blocked me, so umm yeah that legit shattered my heart, no girl's for me I told myself. But now I've slowly recovered from my surgery, mentally as well from all the loner, depression and anxiety, but I still don't know how to get the last month out of head, how to face all those who think I'm a depso in the hostel and why do I feel bad that my ex blocked my, how do I face these issue's.

"FREE 101 Finance Class. If you can't find it, create it. When you encounter a problem, seek for a solution. And if you can't find it, create it. And that is exactly what I did. Recently, a few financial decisions made me realise how important being financially literate was. And hence, I sought out resources to learn about Finance, Credit, Investments, Funds, Taxes, etc. But the problem was I couldn't find the right resources. I know there is a lot of information on YouTube, but it is honestly too cluttered and scattered. I checked out paid resources too, but most of them did not interest me and the reviews were pretty enough to understand that they were far from being student-friendly. Also, I started talking in my circle about this, that is when a few conversations with some friends who were international students hit me. They told me that this lack of financial literacy in our education system put them well behind among their peers. And some of the mistakes they made, hit them bad enough to put them behind by a couple of years. So ofcourse, I had to do something about it. But I couldn't do it alone, so I reached out to my network looking for people who could educate us, without using fancy terms that went over our heads. Among the many conversations, One struck the right cord. We sat down to discuss ways to tackle this problem. And that is how [FinanceGRAD](https://www.linkedin.com/company/financegrad/) was born. With [FinanceGRAD](https://www.linkedin.com/company/financegrad/), we aim to enable individuals to achieve financial well-being through comprehensive education and guidance.

"Regretting my college experience. I (20F) feel like I’ve wasted my college years and am now having serious regrets. For some context, I attend a T20 university that is known as one of the more rigorous/ intense schools. When I got in during my senior year of college, I was of course ecstatic. I was aware that the school would be “hard”, but I was not aware of just how much this would extend past academics. I always imagined myself attending a university that has a good blend of great academics AND a more traditional college environment (think Duke, UVA, UCLA, although I only applied to one of these schools), and had prepared myself for going to tailgates, supporting my school’s sports teams, and having an enjoyable social life. Unfortunately, I am now a junior, and I have done none of these things. Not because I don’t want to, but because there just aren’t many opportunities to. Most students at my school couldn’t care less about anything related to the college experience, many more concerned about grinding on assignments, especially on weekends. I have no issue with how people choose to spend their time — problem is, I’ve adopted this same mentality and have begun to burnout. I wish I had more options to take my mind off school every once in a while, but aside from my school only having D3 sports no one supports and no one really caring about Greek life (myself included), I’ve found that my school just isn’t the environment I envisioned myself in. To make things worse, I’ve found that it has been incredibly hard to meet people, whether in a romantic context, or even just as friends. People are either too busy to maintain friendly relationships or we just don’t have much in common, and as a result, befriending people is almost impossible. When I reflect on my time in college up to this point, I have very few fond memories of doing typical college things, and instead these memories are saddled with times when I’ve stressed trying to make a deadline or sitting alone in the library studying. My biggest regret is the fact that once I graduate, it’ll be even harder to meet people in my age group and this is supposed to be the main time of my life where I should be forming long lasting friendships, gathering my future bridesmaids, and getting into a relationship (whether it lasts past college or not). I understand that I’m exaggerating quite a bit and things will likely be fine in the end, but it’s really hard to have a positive outlook when my high school friends at my flagship university are having the time of their lives while I’m becoming more and more miserable everyday I spend here",Library,High,2.0,reddit:r/college,High,2,2628,466,13,Regretting my college experience.,0

"Mental health is at an all time low. Looking for advice on how to navigate this situation. So this is a long and messy story but here it goes. After graduating in Mechanical Engineering I wanted to get into grad school. I worked as a software engineer for 2 years after graduation and really liked it so I wanted to get a Masters in Computer Science instead. Perhaps even a PhD someday.I didn't get accepted to CS MS programs because I didn't take enough CS courses during undergrad (I took 2, most schools wanted around 8). But I got an offer for a MS in ME program where I would be funded by the department for working as an RA. Since the research was very similar to what I planned to work on if I got into CS I took the offer. My plan was to graduate with a good GPA (in the 3.8-3.9 range) and I was confident that all things considered, I had the ability to do it. But I didn't account for Covid. On my first semester after moving to a new state and for the first time living somewhere without any friends or family, Covid shut everything down. Classes turned into online sessions and the days became increasingly difficult. I also took two very hard courses (Machine learning and Computer Vision) on my first semester and although I was coping well before, once covid hit I lost it. I barely managed to submit the assignments and pass the exams. End of the semester I end up with a C and a B- making my GPA 2.375. For someone who's always had grades in the higher end of the spectrum, this was a situation that took a great toll on my mental health and confidence going forward into the next semester. Once the semester started, the department told me that because of the poor GPA they would cut off my funding if it weren't for my supervisor vouching for me. I was given another chance, get two As this Fall semester or I'm out. So as hard as it was for me, I took it on the chin and decided to give it my absolute very best to ensure I get those two As, not just because I needed the financial aid to continue my program but because I cannot afford to end up with a lower GPA than what I was already in for after last semester's disaster. I took two easy courses after looking at the syllabus. I submitted everything well before the due dates and got close to 100% on both courses till September. Start of October, I had a mid for one of the courses where I studied very hard for a whole week. The exam didn't go perfectly, but I expected to get 70-80/100. The professor released the grades for the exam and I found out I got a 31/100. The average for the class was 42/100. The professor said that this is how she grades most of the time and rarely gives out grades over a B+. I checked how the professor assessed my answers and I found that she was very unfair, deliberately deducting marks for perfectly valid answers. At least 20 marks were deducted for no valid reason. When I approached her for it she said the answers were right but she didn't like them. And then continued to give vague excuses until at one point she got upset and told me to complain to the department if I didn't like the grade. After discussing with my classmates and hearing stories about previous years, I realised that it is practically impossible to get an A in this course. As it stands I'm going to be fired from my RA position after the semester. And that's when my anxiety, depression and frequent panic attacks took a turn for the worst. I'm not just worried about the financial situation but also where my eventual GPA will end up (in the 3.1\~3.2 range if the trend continues). I also had talks to switch my major to CS after this semester but with a GPA below 3.00 I don't think the department will accept my application. I don't think I can carry on with two more semesters of this knowing how I'll end up and so I'm considering leaving the program now. I think I need to start fresh to fix myself and get back my confidence almost all of which I've lost over the last 9 months of living in a constant state of despair and anxiety. I want to transfer to a different school, preferably a bit closer to home. But I'm not sure how my supervisor and the department will react to this. I'm already seeing a therapist and I'm on antidepressants but even those aren't doing the trick anymore. I understand that because of my current mental state, I'm not able to think as clearly as before so I need a second opinion on this. If you read through this super long post and can relate to what I'm going through on some level, please let me know what you think is a good plan of action going into 2021",Academic,Medium,1.0,web:reddit:r/gradschool:search:unfair grading,Medium,1,4588,871,0,Mental health is at an all time low.,0

"I'm a senior in college. Here's what you need to do when applying. I'm a current senior at a large public university who's been very unhappy with the experience. Once upon a time I was just a naive high school senior who had no idea what he was doing or how to pick a college. My family hired a college counselor that was equally clueless. Based on my experiences in college and some of the unanticipated roadblocks I've faced since I've been here, here is my advice for applying to college: * If you hire a college counselor who pushes you to go to a particular kind of school or who gives you any of the advice at the bottom, fire them. Also do not hire a college counselor who's just a family friend or who can give you no advice about the financial aid process or what to do once you pick a school. * If a school offers ridiculous amenities like a water park or a spa, it's usually to make up for a mediocre education. * Many of you know exactly what you want to do. Many of you who know exactly what you want to do will switch majors. Regardless of how much you're hellbent on studying the field you've picked, think about what you like second-most. If you're going for engineering or a STEM field, this applies twice as much for you. Not just because you're likely to switch to an easier major, but because many schools with fantastic engineering programs have shitty other programs. * Use a college-sponsored tour only to get a good visual picture of the college. Your tour guide is a student who was hired specifically to present a positive image of the university. That tour guide will tell you only positive things and will emphasize the school's accomplishments. If there's anything wrong with the college you won't hear about it. * Once you're done with your tour, go to the academic building for your choice of major. Find a random student, preferably a junior or senior and offer to take him or her out to lunch or coffee. Tell the student you'll pay. Being out $20 for someone else's food is much better than being out $20000-80000 at a college you're unhappy about. Be polite and make it clear it's to discuss whether or not the college is a good fit for you. Over lunch, ask the student questions about the program and the university. Tell them you want them to be as honest as possible. If possible, do this for both your first and second choices of major, since different departments can have vastly different funding and teaching qualities. Try to get questions about things you aren't going to be able to find online: * How easy is it to get into upper-level courses? * How is the quality of the teaching? * Do people ever have delay graduation due to low course availability? * What kinds of jobs have people you know gotten directly out of college? Some departments claim really high employment numbers, but most of the jobs people get out of college pay less than average or just suck. * How hard are classes? Do professors just assign book problems, or do they actually push you to learn the material? * How many people are in your upper-level classes? * If a course is full, how easy is it for the department to open up another section? * Do your classes teach up-to-date material, or do professors only teach old ideas? * How easy is it to do undergrad research in the department? * What are your peers like? Do they work really hard? Do they do side projects outside of class? Are they laid back? Do they complain all the time about their workloads? * What are some general annoying bureaucratic issues that I should be aware of? * Knowing what you know now, would you still enroll here? * If you're looking to go for computer science, ask how much of the coursework is focused on object-oriented programming. If the answer is ""All of it"" or ""Most of it"", get out. I'm not a computer science major but most of the people I know who go to or went to JavaSchools were really unhappy. After this, it's time to do your own research. Here are some things that should be publicly available. * Look at an online course catalog and see how many classes are offered. Not the course catalog with every class offered at the college. The list of courses available the semester you visited. * Figure out how many gen eds you have to take. Most gen eds are terrible and you're forced to take them in giant lecture halls with other people who don't want to be there. * Read RateMyProfessor ratings for the professors in both your first and second choices of department. * Look at student/professor ratios. Anything above 12:1 should look suspicious. * Look up credit limits and how to go over. My university makes you pay for any above 18, even if you have a good GPA. You don't want to shell out money to push yourself. * Look up withdrawal procedures. You want to know how easy it is to withdraw from or drop a class. Some schools don't let you drop after two weeks. Others, although this is not standard, will let you drop at any point up until like a month before finals. * Look up transfer credit policies. Some colleges won't let you take credits at other universities once you hit a certain number of credits. For example, mine doesn't let you take community college credits after you hit 60 and doesn't let you take classes anywhere but here once you hit 90. * Check how many of the courses are being taught by adjuncts. Departments with good funding often have full-time lecturers or tenure-track professors teaching introductory classes. If all of your introductory classes are taught by adjuncts, that's a red flag and a sign that your department has bad funding. Here's a list of advice tons of people gave me that you should ignore. This is coming from someone with experience. Most of it was really bad and only hurt me when applying to colleges: * ""It's better to be a big fish in a small pond."" This is bullshit. It's much better to be a medium-sized fish in a big pond. Odds are you aren't going to be the best student in a crappy or mediocre department and if you are, a company will hire a better-prepared average student at a better college. Smaller departments often have extremely limited funding and low course availability. You won't be able to be a big fish. * ""Register here because you can always cross-register for classes at a better school."" This is terrible advice because cross-registration is always a giant pain in the ass. Odds are you'll be limited to one class per semester and you will always be below the other college's students on the priority list. If you're a senior who wants to get into an interesting class at a neighboring university, you will be below their freshman in terms of who gets priority. * ""Go to a cheap public state school because you'll be out less money."" This is often terrible advice because public colleges tend to give shitty financial aid and make up for the tuition price with fees for everything. Good private universities often have high sticker prices, but offer a ton of financial aid so the price is basically the same. Plus you aren't at the mercy of whoever the governor is. Also once you enroll, if you're really unhappy, do well and transfer. Even if you did a ton of research, there are always factors at play that can make college a miserable experience for you even if you're a social butterfly and make friends easily. When you pick a school to transfer to, keep in mind all of the advice I gave above. However be aware that most schools give really shitty financial aid to transfers, so try to do it right the first time!

I came to this school because it's an R1 institution that claims to specialize in Peace and Conflict which is what I wanted to study, but all anyone ever seems to talk about is methods. I didn't want to study computer science but I'm being told I have to learn two different coding languages--only one of which we're actually taught in our methods classes. Everyone else in my cohort seems to be doing okay. They have minor complaints but I think I'm the only one who is abjectly miserable. There are 15 of us and every time I try to talk to anyone about how unhappy I am, they all brush it off and say I'll be fine. My boyfriend is still in undergrad and he tries to be supportive but doesn't understand. My parents are telling me to drop out if I'm this unhappy, but that feels like such a waste.

HELP! Parents make too much money and are giving me too little. So im in the early thinking about college process and Im in a sticky situation. I would really love to go to a prestigious school out of my state in the midwest; I worked so hard for so long and my stats are pretty good. The problem is affording it. My parents make quite a bit of money so we don't qualify for anything needs based but they won't give me very much for college. About 30 thousand a year. I know thins a small amount of money but it's not nearly enough for some of the places I want to go and im really disappointed. I know I can likely get into some of my dream schools but I'll probably just have to stay in state. They also don't want me to take out any loans at all so im pretty much screwed.

"Proposal: You hire a consultant, you pay them from your personal salary. We spent two years of a provost trying to tear the university down and rebuild it in a highly dubious ""restructuring"" plan, where we found out that it wasn't their plan at all, it was a cookie-cutter plan from an educorp consulting firm that recommended nearly exactly the same ""innovative,"" ""personalized"" plan to every university it works with. We paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxpayer money and student tuition for that plan. And we found out that this provost was paying another few hundred K to a different consulting firm for regular policy recommendations--basically, paying someone else to tell them which policies to implement because they did not know how to do their job. So we paid their salary plus a yearly fee (nearly as much, I think) for someone else to do it for them. Now we have a new president after that fiasco, hired because he's the kind of innovative forward-thinking visionary who can pull us out of our financial crisis. The state is willing to pay him two or three times as much as the most well-paid faculty member for his services. Today he unveiled his proposal in more detail than ever before: consultants. We need consultants to tell us how to get out of our financial crisis. We'll pay them, of course, on top of what we're already paying our president to do exactly that. So my proposal is that presidents and VPs need skin in the game: if you want a consultant to do the job you were hired to do, pay them. If you want to subcontract your job out to someone else, don't ask the public, the students, or the university to foot the bill.

"What should I do. Hi all! So currently, I’m finishing my first year of a 4yr BSN RN program as a transfer. The thing is this school is private so it’s expensive and FASFA thinks me and my parents can pay with no help from them other loans, which unfortunately is not the case. I tried applying to a Fall 2025 ADN program nearby since I have some of the prerequisites done and I’m currently about to finish them. I did this since it would be way cheaper and I can become a RN faster. But I was silly and thought I could easily get into since I’ve done/im actively completing the prerequisites with B’s and a few A’s and TEAS score of a 82 is good enough. Boy was I wrong. And silly enough I only applied to the ADN program closest to me and not the other two programs that are only almost an hour away, so the deadline (don’t keep all your eggs in one basket lol). But idk I also think they I didn’t get in since I’m already in a 4 year and maybe admissions thought it was a silly move (I’m coping so hard). So now anyways there’s no programs that are within a reasonable commutable distance from me that I can apply to now for Fall 2025 (can’t dorm, parents don’t want that). I wanna try to apply to transfer to my nearest public state university, which I tried applying before when I graduated from high school but once again didn’t get into since they’re competitive. But the thing is, their transfer program only starts in Spring 2026, and they don’t send responses to application until the middle of fall (October) 2025. I can apply but I’m just missing a statistics class which is one of the things they require to be considered for admissions. And I’d def want to retake the teas over the summer to be more competitive. The thing is, is it worth taking this risk to apply? I mean I didn’t drop out of my current program but the fact that the school I potentially want to transfer to takes so long for a response, and on top of that it’s like it’s not highly guaranteed I can get in. For fall semester this year at the private school I’m at I’ll definitely need a loan so if I got into the other program for spring, what happens then? And then there’s the situation if I drop out now to avoid paying for the fall semester for current school and hope I get into the school I transfer into, if I don’t get in, then what? I lost my job recently since I lost my car in an accident and now that my hours have been restricted with school, most jobs even the minimum wage ones don’t want to hire me, so I would have anything really lined up after that.

Support only materialized after HR was notified. Now that I already have a new job and that I got it without any support from him, he can take his imaginary “supportive reference” and respectfully shove it\].* I think you have lots of strengths, it’s unfortunate it wasn’t a good fit and you didn’t like the Institute… I dont have any regrets and wish to see you do well. *Oh K, even now you are either unwilling to admit it or really fail to see the problem. It is true that it was not a good fit but not because I did not like the Institute…. You have lots of strengths as well, but in my case, you make a better collaborator than a primary postdoc mentor. In this postdoc it often felt as if the roles were reversed with me introducing you to a new field and ways of doing things and furthering your personal agenda instead of building on my doctoral work and growing as a scientist, so I would have been very surprised if you had any regrets.* I am also glad to see the things you started, and you will be duly noted as an authors as the studies come out. Will also share the author list beforehand to avoid confusion. *I am glad to hear this, you have my alternate contact details so you can always reach me for my input on the work I initiated. Likewise, I will also share a public record of the work I have done so we can avoid confusion later. \[I was satisfied to leave it like this. Then he went ahead and did none of that and started publishing preprints and submitting papers excluding me and that got me started on the push for answers and accountability with his employer\].* One small thing is that you have to return the laptop as it’s Institute property… IT will find a way to do so if you are not around *I never took it; it has always been on my desk downstairs in plain view.

Or was it when you consistently refused to provide a supportive reference, preventing me from leaving and continuing to grow as a scientist when it became obvious that the expertise and support you claimed would be available were not? Or perhaps it was when, after I persisted in leaving, you threatened to give a negative reference—citing a sudden concern that I might lose interest in projects I wanted to pursue, even though my track record shows that has never happened.

I am happy to talk to you on the phone if you are truly interested in resolving our differences and getting insight. I have taken your words seriously but I don’t see truth in them and you are not interested at all to listen to what I have to say, so I am not sure why you are asking these questions…. \[I am literally taking him up on his offer to clarify his side of things\] I am working on completing several papers you were part of and will send you the papers before submission. W has made good progress and we hope that paper can be completed. Also I suggested addition of \[my area of expertise\] to T’s paper which led to a strong paper for you. \[Led to a strong paper in a new direction for his lab too\] I am not sure what’s happening to X paper but they are not responding - I suggest you submit that to Y journal - and for the sake of science please publish that- you can even remove my name from it, if it helps publishing it any faster. \[This is the study where I still believe J was gifted authorship, but the journal does not know any of that drama.

"Need help, not sure what I can do from here. I need some advice in regards to college. (I apologize ahead of time for the long post, but I need help and don't know where to go from here). Back when I was still pregnant with my baby (in January 2019) I was accepted and enrolled in a college near my home for an online medical billing and coding class. I was set to receive a Work-Ready Scholarship that would cover the entire cost of the course (except for the cost of the exam to get my certificate). I attended the first in-person class to get my textbooks and to login to the portal where all of our assignments and announcements from our instructor would be posted. We were instructed to complete the first book (on Medical Terminology) by ourselves over the course of the next two months and we'd check back in to schedule the next in-person class to start the coding portion of the course. I completed the first book and all the assignments in the time frame and our next in-person class was scheduled for March 19th. I went into labor early and on March 17th I had my baby. I texted my instructor to let her know my situation and she told me that it wouldn't be an issue. She told me to take some time and when I was ready to continue the course, she'd catch me up. After a month, I let her know I was ready. She told me that was a hiccup with my Work-Ready Scholarship and to contact the school for more information. When I did, they told me I would need to proof my US Citizenship before getting the funds released and be able to continue my class. (I was adopted from China as a baby and my parents got me a US Citizenship. I attended another larger university fresh out of high school and was asked to prove my Citizenship. I gave them my US Birth Certificate and they released my KEES Money and my Scholarships.) I gave this college the same US Birth Certificate and they told me they couldn't accept it and that my only option would be to pay out of pocket to continue the class. At the time I was a stay-at-home and my (now ex) fiancé was the only source of income. We simply couldn't afford to put me through school. The school never contacted me again and I figured that I just wouldn't continue the class. Fast forward a little over a year and a half and I get a letter from a collection agency for the entire cost of the course (A little over $6,000). I contacted the school confused and they sent me an un-enrollment form that someone else filled out for me and I NEVER SIGNED that said I had completed 120 credit hours. They explained they couldn't give me a ""refund"" because by the time I contacted them it was over the allotted time frame. I was so frustrated after being confused and no one really helped me. I felt like they just shrugged their shoulders and refused to listen to what I was saying. I am a single mom of two now on an even lower income now than I was then and don't receive any child support. I left the charge on there and waited some more. Figured I'd cross the bridge when I needed to. Fast forward to this year. I am now working full time at a prison and would like a higher paying job, I am encouraged by my coworkers and boss to start applying for higher paying positions, but almost everything through the state you need a minimum of a bachelor's degree to qualify for. I am in it for the retirement (25 years), and can sometimes comp my bachelor's degree requirement with experience (have a little over 2.5 years now), but would love to go back to college anyways to get that degree as well. I applied to a community college just to get those pesky general education classes done at a lower rate per credit hour than a big university. I was accepted and just got an email saying I've been approved to get grants to cover the entire cost of my classes! But then they see that I have other colleges I've attended on my educational record and need to send them my official transcripts before I can fully enroll in the classes. To get those transcripts released, I was told I needed to pay what I owed first. So we go right back to asking why I am being charged the cost of the entire course when I only attended the first class. I emailed and wrote letters and even called the school offering to pay the cost of the textbooks and the online portal and the first class I attended because I did use those. I have called every day without an answer. I found that my portal was still able to be accessed and logged in. I took screenshots of all of my completed assignments and unread updates from the instructor. I also found the name and number of my instructor and texted her. She was confused as well as to why I would be charged when she told them I never attended the full course. I have contacted legal aids for low-income people and they told me they don't deal with cases like mine. They suggested that I file for bankruptcy although, it would not cover any education costs. I have also filed a complaint with the board of education. Is there anything I can do? I don't feel like I should be charged the entire cost of the course when I never attended past the first class or completed the first book. Please make suggestions on where I should go from here!

The only problem is, the set dates are, in fact, correct. They are listed on the pacing schedule, the syllabus, the individual assignments, and filled out in Blackboard so it automatically shows up on her student calendar. Of course, I also sent out announcements last week stating that the assignments were due last Friday. (Note: the due date has never changed; it’s been set since day one.) Now it’s the middle of week 8, and I’m tired of dealing with this new breed of stupid. So, I email Pebbles back to inform her that the due dates are indeed correct. I even attach the pacing schedule again with all the due dates. Try my best to put on my happy tone and steer her back into doing work on time, amd talk about the importance of checking the announcements and calendars.

"Did I make the wrong choice by going to the one school I applied to that doesn’t have my major. Sorry for the long post When I originally applied to colleges I wanted to go somwhere that I could double major in fashion design and something else, but when I started asking I realized the programs were all stricter than I thought. I was going through some mental health struggles at the beginning of the year so choosing a college wasn't really on the top of my to do list. The problem is by the time I had to make a choice I felt really rushed, and I'm also starting to feel like that may have influenced my decision. I have always loved fashion design, but I have a lot of issues with the fashion industry, hence my wanting to go somewhere I could double major. If I don't go into fashion design I want to work in sustainability. I was accepted into Drexel, Syracuse, Marist, SCAD, and University of cunncinatti for fashion design, and as for other schools I got waitlisted from all three UCs I applied to and I got into University of puget sound. My high school was also super A little bit more context into my part of my decision, my high school was really wtimy and had no extracurriculars so I also wanted to go somewhere I would be able to make up for lost time by playing sports and doing theatre. I said no to Marist because 1 I don't think I'm built for the cold, 2 their program is fairly strict, and 3 outside of their fashion program I don't think I would choose the school/ didn't feel like I would find a sense of community. I said no to Drexel because 1 I don't really want to go to school with an urban campus 2 their dorms look really depressing, and 3 their fashion program is all 4 years and super intense/ plus it's closed to non majors so I wouldn't be able to minor in it if I chose. It to major in it. Scad: I love scad but 1 they don't have lacrosse, and two they only have design related classes, and i want more of a liberal arts curriculum to explore other career paths. Syracuse: most expensive, did not vibe with the people, very cold. I committed to university of Puget sound because I loved the campus, I liked the class sizes, I felt at home with the people, and I was recruited to play d3 lacrosse there. The problem is, they don't have any design related classes, and there art department only has painting, sculpture, ceramics, and printmaking. I have always loved learning, in pretty much any topic apart from math so I don't really know what I'm going to study, and a part of me feels like I'm giving up on my dreams, even though I know that's not true. My parents have told me they will support me in whatever I do, and fully support me in going to fashion school, which I know is so many peoples dreams and I kind of feel like I'm just throwing it away?

"No one wants to live in a world without sociologists, political scientists, historians, literary scholars, poets, writers, musicans, anthropologists and the countless other experts that help us to understand and express our own humanity. With the advent of the digital revolution, automation, AI, and looming global war and economic crises, this need is perhaps greater than ever before. We really need to think hard collectively about HOW we want to use these new technologies, understand and deconstruct our preconceptions about them, and build democratic consensus around them. Humanities scholars are great at this. There is no job market for the humanities, true. But why is this? I think that too often we want to blame administrations and the market, and we get defensive. We blame everyone but ourselves, even as we shrink our own programs, conform to market pressures to write specialist books only readable by other academics, and receede further and further into the universities even as the admins close the walls of these institutions on us yet further. We are weak, and we are bending over backwards and giving in to it all, becoming weaker still. We need to go on the offensive as humanities scholars, because people are more interested than ever in these fields. Part of the answer here is to give a middle finger to the academic job market and stop letting it dictate what we do and who we do it for. We can't sit around waiting for administrations at universities, state legislatures, the federal gov, and others to decide we are worthwhile and invest, even as we are proving to them more and more our irrelevance by digging into our obscure, specialist topics in the hopes that our scholarly novelty can win us jobs. The thing is, I think all of us in the humanities know too that public interest in our fields is at an all time high. People everywhere are talking about history, society, culture, art, and politics. They want to understand and critique it and create it and get involved in it all, and yet the people who can help them to grow and do this are locked away in unaffordable classrooms with dwindling attendance. We must get out of the ivory tower, take the risks, and go directly to the people with our scholarship, research, and pedagogy. We gotta bring them in and talk with them and build community. What does this look like? Well, for history, it can mean history workshop movements. In the 1970s and 1980s in Germany, for example, communities all across the country--big and small--came together in workshops to start researching, capturing, discussing, and writing about local history. Scholars met with local community members, archivists, and librarians--all working together to workshop history. It was really empowering, educational, and fostered growth for all in involved. It also sparked a massive interest in history at the academic and higher ed levels, boosting enrollments. I'm graduating in a year or two with my PhD in German history. I absolutely know job prospects are slim. But, ya know what? I am determined not to let that dictate how I live my life. I will go out there, post a flyer at my local library, start a history workshop, start a podcast, start engaging my community, give free lectures, and BUILD something if I can't find it. I know the money might not be there, and I know folks have mouths to feed and this isn't for everyone.

"personal struggle linked to studying. I’ve been struggling for the past six months with what can best be described as paralysis. It feels like I have been disassociated from myself—like my body is running on autopilot while I’m just a helpless external spectator. My life has been going downhill during this entire time, but I want to focus especially on academics. I have always been the first in my classes and the valedictorian wherever I go. But since August 2024, I haven’t been able to understand or do well in any of my classes. I’ve been failing terribly, even in the subjects I used to ace with ease. The specific problem that I want to vent about and ask for advice on is that I cannot sit my butt down and hold a damning book. I can’t bring myself to do any practice problems or go through class notes—not because I mentally can’t understand them, but because I have associated so many negative emotions, regrets, and harsh self-talk with studying, especially with doing practice problems or test tests. I feel completely overwhelmed whenever I try. I know that this inability to humble down and just do the assigned practice problems is holding me back, but the thing is—I never really used them in past years, and I was still doing fine. Now, the thought of facing them fills me with an unbearable emotional charge. On top of that, I struggle with the fear of coming up short or looking incompetent. I have also noticed a decline in my ability to analyze and use critical thinking. I don’t think this is directly related to everything else, but I still wanted to mention it. Has anyone been in a similar place? And if so, how did you move on? I think I’ve had a big head problem—I always looked down on others and thought I was special. Yes, I know this is immature, and I’m trying to figure out its roots. TL;DR: I feel like crying when I try to study. Seriously sitting down and doing the work feels like it’s hurting me emotionally and physically, but I need to find a way to develop a healthier approach to learning that isn’t based on being the best.

"advice about my major. so for context i live in a country with a different system to the US, we sit for an exam at the end of highschool and according to the grade you get, you get to choose which college you can go to. 2 years prior, i already had in mind that i'd do something engineering related since i hated (and still do) rote memorization, so i ended up being a maths major for the last 2 years of high school. i used to be top of my class in maths but then after covid happened i felt like my level kept dropping while all my friends were improving. the last 2 years were hell because i struggled with math especially, although i honestly worked problems day and night and was always present in class and did my absolute best i felt incapable because the results were not showing. i ended up graduating with a very good average (18/20) but my lowest grade ended up being maths because despite all my preparation i still got stuck with the problems in our national exam despite it being deemed super easy compared to the previous years. my best grades were in philosophy, french, english, biology, chemistry, compsci and physics(which is my fav subject). i was still accepted in my engineering school of choice tho, but i can't help but feel like i took the wrong path considering my math results. i feel utterly lost, and i'm so scared of failing (not because of lack of effort since I'm willing to put in all the work necessary) i just feel like i don't have the natural critical thinking, smarts and reasoning skills that maths require. i understand problems only after i get stuck and think about them and someone else shows me how it's done. my brain just can't piece it together. i know I'm not completely stupid since I studied in middle school and high school reserved for ""elites"" that you can only enter if you pass a very selective exam and i succeeded in both. so I've been thinking about switching to medecine instead (drastic i know) but my grade allows it and it's the most prestigious thing you can do in my country and I've always been told i'd make a great doctor since i like researching about diseases and stuff like that, but what put me off was the amount of rote memorization med students have to do since i really struggle with it. any advice would be greatly appreciated! i hope there aren't too many mistakes, i think it's obvious it's not my first language lol.

"Is there anything that can be done to accommodate this situation? I’m a disabled student and I’m scared. Hi! I’m in my senior year of college. I am disabled with some very serious chronic medical conditions for which I have many accomodations for through the disability center at my school. For the entirety of my college career, I’ve been able to avoid taking early morning classes and curate my schedule to fit my unique needs. However, this semester I had no choice but to take a 9:30 am class that is required for my major. I can’t take it next semester because it is a prerequisite for a class I need to take next semester. The thing about mornings is that they trigger SEVERE flare-ups for my medical conditions. It’s not just “oh I don’t like mornings I don’t wanna get up.” Forcing myself to wake up earlier than my body is meant to get up has sent me to the ER multiple times. I also have a circadian rhythm disorder (that I’ve had my entire life) and can’t fall asleep until the early morning hours anyways, which makes this even more difficult. My body literally is not wired like the average person’s when it comes to sleeping. I’ve been in communication with my professor about this and she is a very nice woman who is understanding of the fact that I am sick &amp; need to utilize my accommodations. One of my accommodations is flexible attendance, meaning I am allowed to miss class for medical reasons (ex: flare-up). Obviously, though, I can’t just *never* go to class. And the issue is that going to this class is also *causing* flare-ups. The class is also a difficult one (theory). I have only been able to make it twice this semester so far, which isn’t great. Both times took a toll on my health physically. Basically I’m asking for any ideas here. Any suggestions to pose to the disability center/my professor? Like I genuinely am at a loss for what to do here. I feel like it may be inappropriate and outrageous to ask her if she could record her lectures and post them online for me, but right now that is the only way I can think of to make it through this class.

"it depends on the type of campus life your university offers. for example, i go to penn state, one of the universities that usually always has something going on throughout the semester. another big thing for experiencing college is what kind of person you are. are you a very social person? do you enjoy spending time around a lot of new people and making friends? if so i think living on campus is the best option. i have a friend who lives 5 minutes away from university park and most of his friends are people who went to the same university as us. he told me that he would like to live on campus so he could experience more of the campus life, but hes not upset that he doesnt live on campus. personally speaking, im only in my dorm room to sleep at the end of the day. and its not to go study somewhere else like the library or anything; its mainly just to hang out with my friends, go to the gym, go to my club &amp; fraternity meetings, classes, or just go eat. in my opinion the luxury of having an on campus housing arrangement is more about the opportunity to be in command of your own space, set your own rules, and be independent. to circle back to my first point, if your university doesnt offer a lot of campus life stuff to do and is more academic forward rather than an all-encompassing campus life it might be in your best interest to save your money and commute. but i can not stress this enough, if you decide to live on campus, do not camp out in your dorm room it will be the worst decision you make even if you arent social.

"What is the attitude towards for-profit publishers among your colleagues. Even though the topic is rarely discussed among my colleagues, when it does come up, I notice that many people care a lot about the state of academic publishing nowadays. Open Access publishing is getting more popular, but the associated article processing fees mean that the popularity of Open Access is funneling even more grant money straight into their coffers. Still, most people don't seem to be aware of alternatives, or they are aware but don't give them serious consideration, even though quality Diamond Open Access (i.e. no fees) journals are getting more common. Is this discussion happening in your field, and what are people's attitudes towards it? Are they content to keep doing review and editorial work for big publishers with no recompense?

"First time back to school but online and I feel overwhelmed. So I decided to go through school to change my career path. I have been having crushing anxiety over it because I'm terrible at keeping good grades and barely scraped by in high school. My first semester back I picked up 3 classes just to see how it would go. My work was flexible enough that I'd be able to study during free time at work and at home. I got a weird promotion to where my schedule completely changed my first week into classes to where that didn't work out anymore, and on top of that I was training for 10 hours a day with my head in a book or computer. Two of my classes I got grades higher than I ever thought I would (So far a B and a C but they're high enough that when they're finalized I'm looking at an A and B) but my other class started way later to the point that I was already overwhelmed and put it on the back burner. Understandably, the professor doesn't accept late work but I also can't withdrawal from a class I completely neglected. I did so good with everything that got thrown my way but then I feel that I have completely failed. I feel mildly like giving up but aside from the neglect it still feels possible to keep going so I scheduled summer and fall classes. If anyone who is going to school with a full time job has any advice on how to juggle the both I would love the advice.

"Problems with my Program Coordinator (Online Master's). Hey everyone. I'm in my last 6 hours of my Master's program and am looking at graduating in just a few weeks. While that sounds like it should be great and smooth sailing I'm becoming extremely frustrated with my program and the schools administration concerning my graduation application. I first submitted my application for graduation (digitally) back in July (maybe 2 weeks before the start of my fall semester) and at the end of the application it said to check with my program coordinator to make sure they completed an audit of my degree. I believe that I reached out on 7/27 for the first time to ask if I was all set and good to go for graduation. The program coordinator responded back about 4 days later and said to ""reach back out when I get enrolled for classes"". To that, I responded that I was enrolled in my last two classes and asked when a good time would be for us to talk. No response. Realizing that I was doing this very early in the semester I waited the week or so that was left until classes started and emailed him back in the same chain advising that I was checking in. Maybe 5-6 days pass by before he responded back and said to ""reach out to him tomorrow"" so that we can discuss. (This is where I really start to get annoyed with this guy.) I call him and he literally asks me if I'm already enrolled in my classes and says that he would audit my degree once I turned in my graduation application. We finally clear up that I have completed all of those things and he finishes up his tangent about how he was wanting to change certain dynamics of the program and then proceeds to tell me that he would be in touch when he sees my completed graduation application. We literally got nowhere. Weeks pass and I emailed him again (same email chain) asking for a follow up to our previous discussions as I was wanting to make travel plans to my university for the graduation. He doesn't respond and a week later I start getting to the point where I'm losing faith in this guy and the program as a whole. I forwarded that email chain yo the grad school asking for someone to audit my application package and transcript to make sure I'm good to go, they send me to the registrar, the registrar then sends me back to my program coordinator (All on the same email chain!) and he never responds. I go back to the grad school basically as a last ditch effort and they tell me that they have heard complaints about this guy and were looking into changing up the program's coordinator, they then tell me that they went ahead and pulled my transcript and verified that I was good to go. So I end up finally getting my answer and decide to move on with my life.At least I thought I was. 2 weeks later (about 2 weeks ago) my program coordinator then decides to email me in a group email with the program students and is asking us to fill out a file for him. The file is a word document titled ""Business School Graduation Application"" with a self audit portion for me to complete at the bottom. Annoyed that this is basically what I had been asking for since July I go ahead and fill it out and send it back to him. He responds saying that it looks good and then says something about how he approved some credits from a Dr. Such&amp;Such that I had never even heard of before. Turns out that he had me confused with another student and ended up telling me so. Is it over yet? Nope, not yet! On Friday (10/22) I get another family from him, this time it is addressed directly to me, asking me to complete the same word document application again! I respond with a kind of serious email including the grad school BCC'ed and included the previous word document application that I sent him along with a pdf copy of my last conversation with him where he said the document that he got from me looked good. I requested a read receipt on it and specifically asked in the email that he confirm that everything looks good for me once he reviewed it. Well earlier today I see that he opened and read the email but I still haven't heard from him. If you've stuck with me this far I really appreciate it! I'm just frustrated and really don't know where to turn next. I live 1300 miles from this school and my wife and I have already made travel plans to get there. I just really want to know if I'm going to be good to graduate! Am I being a little too hard on this guy? If not, do you have any suggestions of who I can inform about this issue? I've thought about the Chair of my particular degree area or even reaching out to the business school but have held off. I'm also working on applying for an Ed.D program that I'm hoping to start next fall so I'm really needing this to get straightened out!
