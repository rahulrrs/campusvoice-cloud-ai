"Undeniably esoteric question: tips for interpreting English grad material written by non native speakers. As per title. Currently attending a grad program at a European Uni directed toward an international body of students (all course material (questions, reading, and lectures) is in English) written by non-native speakers. While most of the material is fine, there seems to be at least one answer prompt/project goal that I will have to resubmit per assignment due to language error. Prompts that have for the most part not been updated in 13 years. I study maps and data visualizations. Here are some examples: * What is the most important entity in a GIS? *Really vague, entity can be almost any noun. Additionally, importance of viz components really varies by project.* * Do you think Topology is important? Why/why not? *Flat out looks like it's asking your opinion. Visualizations, while still using the principles of Topology, are increasingly less likely to feature them as issues of primary importance. Instead wanted to know what benefits topology conveys to every visualization, no matter of what order that importance is.* * What range of UTM should locations X, Y, and Z use? *Confusing because the official nomenclature of UTM is ""zones"", not ""ranges"".* * Etc I have written down every such error I have found and sent them to the head instructor of my program, and for the most part he has thanked me for cataloging them and agreed with me. However, I still keep running into these issues and needed to redo past work while working on current assignments. Is this a common problem?

"How do I adjust to the college style of learning. I just finished my first semester of college and it knocked the wind out of me. I had to drop one class, failed another, and only passed one. The thing that's really got me confused is highschool had WAYY more work than college and yet I still passed. I have a feeling it's just because if I'm not at school I'm not in school-mode, I think? During highschool I was in class 5 days a week for 8 hours a day, so I had more time dedicated to ""school-mode"" so to speak.

"How much does where you go for undergrad effect your masters admission. So basically, I always wanted to go abroad for undergrad, and while I applied and got in with some scholarships, the cost was a bit too much. So, I ended up opting to go to a university in my own country, where I also got a decent scholarship, and whose tuition comes out to about half the cheapest uni package I got abroad(plus I obviously save on living expenses since I live at home). However, the uni ranks around the 200-250 range in QS rankings(despite being generally considered one of the top 2-3 unis in the country). Although the facilities and opportunities offered are good(internship placements, research opportunities, etc), I'm a tad bit worried that the relatively lower ranking would affect my options while trying to apply for top grad schools when the time comes. I'm kind of worried I made the wrong play, but i'm not too sure. On the one hand, the lower ranking is an obvious negative. On the other, I don't really feel TOO lacking opportunity-wise in the uni, plus the cheaper cost let me double major in math along with cs, which could've definitely been too expensive had I done it abroad. So guess I'm just kind of asking if I'm screwed?(when it comes to top unis at least) Since obviously I can't change my situation, I also wanted to know what metrics should I focus on/aim for during my undergrad if i want to 'make up' for the lower ranking and get into a really good grad school(might seem like a dumb question, but I say it because I've heard you should have slightly different priorities depending on whether your planning to work straight out of uni or doing grad school). In general, even though im a long way off from actual applications, i'd still appreciate any advice on how different graduate applications are to undergraduate applications.

"Unfair Policy At My University. Hello, this is my first time posting in this subreddit, but I need to consult with academics on a matter that happened to me today that I believe is very unfair. &amp;#x200B; I am an international student who is finishing up college, and I have to graduate by a certain date in order to return back home for my military service. So I have perfectly aligned my classes to accommodate that date. My College follows a Quartley curriculum. So last week my Winter Quarter began, and I was enrolled in my classes and everything was going well. three of my classes are online, and at my college, we have a participation policy where if a student does not participate in a class he gets automatically dropped out of the class in the second week. Today I woke up and I found out that I got automatically dropped out of one of my online courses. even though I had shown signs of participation and submitted the assignment. However, Blackboard was down on Sunday so I guess my assignment was never registered properly. I instantly email the course's professor asking him to enroll me back in, explaining the system must've made a mistake. But he repeatedly says no and blames me for making the ""choice"" to not participate in his class. I explain to him that I did not make that choice, and the system unfairly dropped me, but he would not budge even after explaining to him that I have to graduate by a certain day. I tried emailing my adviser asking for help but she sided against me as well explaining that he's just following the university policy. As a result of this issue, I was dropped out of a class I have been participating in 10 days after the quarter has begun. And the devastating outcome for me now is that I might not be able to graduate in time to come back and do my military service. I am really not sure what to do at this point. I've been thinking about escalating the matter but needed to get opinions from fellow academics first. I mean how does this policy remotely make any logical sense for online classes? How do you **claim** a student has not participated for sure with lack of data evidence? Furthermore what if a student is new to the university and is just figuring out how to use online courses, I find it ridiculous that my university automatically drops out students after one week of admissions without even sending a warning email. **TL:DR I got unjustly dropped out of an online course that I was participating in. with a claim that I was not participating and hence why I was dropped.

"Plagiarism Accusation. I have a question/story regarding the website Turnitin and plagiarism. This did happen a couple of years ago but it is something that still bothers me to this day as I have never plagiarized any of my course work. *BACKSTORY* I did dual enrollment my senior year of highschool with a military college and completed two English classes during that time and both came out with an A. After I graduated highschool I continued to go to that same college for over a year and completed many essays during that time and was even asked to be a tutor for essays. I ended up leaving and moving to a different college and continued my education at other institutions/took breaks. **STORY** Fast forward 4 years Iater I decided to go back to my first college to purse a degree. I had a class, a very easy class, I think it was critical thinking, where I needed to research a topic of my choice and write an essay over it. So I go through all the steps of getting sources through the school library and writing my rough draft with my words and research, and felt really good about my rough draft so I submitted it. At our school once you submit an essay through the school portal it automatically gets turned in to turnitin, so there’s no point in turning it in separately to turnitin or any other plagiarism checking website bc it does it for us. A few days later I receive an email from my professor saying I received a 0 on MY essay bc I had a 100% similarly report from turn it in from a previous students of hers, who happened to share my last name. I was stunned to say the least because I literally when into my schools online library and picked articles that I could source for my topic, then proceeded to use my own knowledge and words to write my paper. I emailed her back and started questioning who the person was and how I was shocked bc I thought of the paper in my own head and did my own research. She replied with the persons name saying it was a previous student of hers and I needed to send proof of how I know her. I DIDNT KNOW THIS PERSON AT ALL, the only thing I knew was that we shared the last name and that’s only because I was told what her name was. I told her I can’t send proof of not knowing someone bc I didn’t know her, she proceeded to ask me the same question and to send her proof of how I know this person. At that point I was getting frustrated because I have 0 clue how to send evidence of not knowing someone. Anyways we kept emailing back and forth about it and when I told her I was going to get the dean involved and investigate, she later came back and said that her previous student turned in the same exact paper in a prior term to turnitin (players website) but didn’t actually submit the paper to her class so she said she’d go back in and change the grade but I needed to write a whole new paper. I obviously declined and withdrew from her class bc I didn’t trust her grading any of my work because of what happened and because what she said didn’t make sense. My question is, why would a student write a whole essay and turn it in to a plagerism website but not submit the paper to the class itself? Especially since when you submit a paper through our student portal it automatically goes to turnitin. Why was this only found out after me threatening to go to the dean? How did this student have the exact same word from word paper as me with the exact same sources from a previous class of hers? Could she have messed something up and did something? Again it’s hard to believe that some random girl that I shared a last name with just so happened to write down word from word, cite from cite, a paper I wrote and thought of from my own head, the exact same paper as me and turn it in to a plagerism website months or years before but not submit it?

Response to the 1^(st) point: Disabilities aren't a flu that can be slept away. They can hurt a person for the whole life and prevent them from doing what everyone else is able to. Disabled persons are literally the ones who live the worst life on the planet and they don't get to decide when it hurts the most. Does it mean disabled persons don't deserve tertiary education at all? Would you dare say the same to Stephen Hawking and every other disabled scientist? Response to the 2^(nd) point: In academia, you can masquerade unfair treatment as *MUH academic decisions* by citing *MUH academic freedom* to get away with it. In workplace, a company can be sued to bankruptcy for such violations. Why? Because the *Equality Act 2010* (UK), *Title IX* (US) etc. exist. Such common mentality of professors clearly shows how detached they are from real society - they still think they are in the 20^(th) Century when almost no disabled persons were able to do university. Perhaps it's time for them to step out of their ivory tower to look at the real world? What's in the mind of these professors? By what rights do professors think they are entitled to mistreat disabled students and deny them the accommodations required by human rights laws? &amp;#x200B; &gt;Professors see themselves as authority in academia and they accredit their success to hard work and personal sacrifice. **When they see disabled people receiving ""special treatment"", they find it unfair**. You either have what it takes or you don't and ""disability is no excuse"". **They veil their ableism with arrogance and ignorance**. If they knew just half of what we have to put up with in society, they'd change their attitude really quickly. &amp;#x200B; &gt;**A good chunk of university professors are** a\*\*holes who are **power mongers**. &gt; &gt;I had one who docked my grade from an A to a C minus for having the audacity to wind up in the cardiac ICU due to a dangerous arrhythmia that nearly killed me. Never mind the fact that practically the entire ICU unit wrote letters and called him. Nope. The f\*\*ker probably wanted to brag that a student was so afraid of him and afraid to miss class that she collapsed and died in class in front of everyone. &amp;#x200B; &gt;one of my professors said that extended time as an accommodation for my adhd was “unreasonable” and “overly burdensome” on him, and that there was “no precedent” for it. when i pointed out that extended time is literally the most common accommodation and therefore there is plenty of precedent and it has been proven time and time again to be reasonable, he said what matters is what HE considers reasonable. i said that was factually incorrect according to the law and he claimed he EMAILED THE ADA and they told him he was right. at this point my disability counselor/student advocate spoke up and pointed out that the ada is a piece of legislation, not an organization, and that he could not have exchanged emails with a document, and whoever he spoke to was wrong. he was stunned into silence for like five seconds and then pivoted and said that he was being discriminated against LMAO &amp;#x200B; To professor users lurking on this subreddit: Don't try to convince me that these are *MUH isolated cases* when disability discrimination cases have been recorded in literally every university and happening again and again across the Anglosphere for decades and when you have wrecked the lives of thousands upon thousands of students. **You all have NO moral authority to argue anything with us regarding this issue**.

"If you were given a choice between a relatively good degree in terms of job prospects from an average college, and a relatively weaker degree in a much more reputable university, which would you choose. Specifically, the choice is between Computer Science (CS) in Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and Data Science and Analytics (DSA) in National University of Singapore (NUS). I am aware both degrees offer mamy career opportunities outside, but generally speaking Computer Science has more job opportunities and is less competitive than data-analytics related jobs (In singapore, to be competitive as a data analyst many take up a masters degree and above). This tilts me towards studying computer science at NTU. At the same time NUS is a lot better resource wise and it's educational standards are higher compared to NTU. NTU seems to be far behind. Uncaring professors, inept TAs, outdated teaching material, professors who are only able to research and not teach, explaining how the uni rankings may not match up with actual standards etc etc, these are the complaints I've gotten so far whether online or in person. The concern isn't just that it'll be a worse environment, but that employers might also value a degree from NTU less. On the other hand, NUS has better professors, I hear professors are much more caring and take up the initiative to help struggling students. They also have much better resources that I can tap into to improve my learning. Not to mention connections etc. And if I do feel like a software related career is more for me, I could always take a second major (while also taking advantage of the resources around me to ""pivot""(yes easier said than done)). Basically, I'm not biased against NTU because it's less prestigious than NUS, NTU really might not be as good as NUS in terms of what it has to offer and I'm not sure if I will be able to do as well there.

"Are there any 'Traditional' Pen-and-Paper Colleges? Universities that do not heavily use Blackboard/Online components for every Course. In 2015 I entered my first year of Uni and I struggled severely with my Maths Courses - I did awesome on my In-Class Assignments and my Pen-and-Paper Exams. Problem was, the online Homeworks. If you don't type your answer in the exact format the answer is listed on their 'Server' as, you're marked incorrect, regardless of if your answer is of equal value. My Professor at the time didn't care when I asked for assistance trying to understand what format the Site was looking for *(I think it was ""UT"" from the University of Texas?)*. At my wit's end, I went to the Tutoring Centre, had my Homework all completed on paper and I'd try plugging the answers in, sitting side-by-side with someone who took the Course the year before me. He'd say *""That looks right""* and I'd lose.25 Points over and over and over on each question, as we couldn't figure out the preferred format for the Answer. I got an F on the Homework, with someone right there who passed the year before. It was so demoralising I took a Withdrawal mid-Semester. Knowing I'm capable of getting an A *(and even getting one on the Midterm!)*, but scoring low-B's to C's on every Homework was so discouraging and from my POV felt like artificial difficulty because my Uni entered into a contract with some Tech entity to ""optimise"" education. It's been almost a decade, I'm successful in my career but I still want a Degree - I love learning! But all I'm hearing about is BlackBoard and other Sites being used now even for Essays and Fill-in-the-Blank Questions. Or about Respondus bugging out every time you try to take a Test, clicking 'Submit' on an Assignment only to have the page tell you you've been Signed-Out and all your progress is lost, Professors accusing you of using AI *(or using it themselves?)* etc. I just don't know if I can deal with **everything** being Virtual, especially Maths. Do I just have to tough it out and maybe it's better in higher-level Courses, or Grad School, when Professors have less to individually grade so they do it themselves? **Or** \- maybe BlackBoard and all of these Sites/Programs are better nowadays? It's not that I'm tech-illiterate, my job is in IT and I code in some of the basic languages, but the whole song-and-dance is too taxing if College is less about evaluating what I've learned about the material and more about jumping through a hoops to placate faceless Apps that never gave any formatting instructions.

To start, I’m at a crossroads in my life and I’m honestly pissed off and tired of working the BS jobs I’ve been doing and I’ve made the decision I want to actually go to college and learn a skill now. After I graduated high school I couldn’t figure out what I wanted to do so I intended to take 1 year off but as a lot of people always say that 1 year becomes a lot longer and that was true for me. I am seeking a career in business management, but I need some advice. I excelled in high school I made honour roll every year and graduated top of all my classes, but being out of school for almost 7 years now I am nervous to take the leap to college as I feel that because of working I’ve forgotten a lot of stuff I learned back in high school and gotten dumber. I seen they have college transfer courses which are labeled as (General Arts and Science) which is a 1 year program that goes through 8 different courses and is more of a bridge course, I was wondering if this would be beneficial for someone like me, but at the same time I don’t wanna waste another year and course fee for a useless course I may not need. Will it be hard to get back into it if I go straight for the course I wanna do, or should I spend the extra money and do the general course first. My biggest worry is paying all the money and failing, I won’t drop out as I’ve toughed out working crappy jobs where I’m abused every day for the last 6 years, so 2-4 years of education seems like a walk in the park, it’s just I wanna learn new things and grow as the workplace life without education isn’t engaging enough for me to care, excel the same as I did in high school and I just don’t wanna go into something unprepared because of all my time off and end up failing.

"Terrified about being rejected. I applied to 4 school psych programs in southern california (3 in LA, one in SD bc I'm trying to relocate to the LA area eventually). I know 4 is a low number, but when I looked up normal amounts of grad programs to apply to, it said 4-6. I also didn't have a ton of money for application fees, so that was another reason I just did 4. This is my first time really applying to grad school and I'm terrified I won't get in anywhere/get into the one I really want and that I won't cope with the rejection well. Does anyone have any advice? Current school psych grad students, do I even have a chance? Details about my circumstance: The programs I applied to are CSULB, LMU, CSULA, and SDSU My undergrad major was psychology and my final weighted gpa was 3.3 I took a gap year to work, save, and grow personally and professionally before committing to a grad program, so I might be at an academic disadvantage compared to someone who's fresh out of undergrad with a higher overall gpa I have almost 2 years of experience working in educational therapy, which is the strongest thing I have going for me My letters of rec are from my boss, a past client, someone I used to babysit for and a past professor. There was an issue with my professor which I'm not going to go into detail, but she was unreachable and I got my past babysitting client as a backup. She was able to make LMU's February deadline, but I'm worried that the other programs would reject me for not having a professor's letter of rec even though I reached out to them all about the situation when it happened and did everything right on my end from the beginning UPDATE: I ended up getting accepted into the program I wanted most (not saying the exact school because I don't feel comfy putting that on the internet even tho this is an anonymous account😅), and rejected from the other 3.

"Something to keep in mind is contrary to a lot of talk from Fox News and other far-right newsmedia, Profs aren't usually the ones to inspire or lead student protests. Profs WISHED they had such high powers (ROTFLOL). In reality, vast majority of campus protests are usually inspired and completely lead by the students. If Profs tried to lead protests as much as far-right newmedia would have the larger public believe, the most likely responses won't be immediate compliance, but variants of ""Whatever boomer!"" followed by eyerolls and the students doing the contrary. With that being said, there are different student political cultures depending on college campus and what groups of students you happen to fall in with. They can also change greatly over a matter of years/decades. For instance, Princeton and USC were much more politically conservative 3+ decades ago whereas within a matter of a decade and half, Princeton and USC became much more progressively left and one could see many students who'd seem much more at home at Oberlin or Vassar fitting in happily there whereas they'd have had a much harder time being welcomed or fitting in those campuses 25+ years ago. On the flipside, several older Berkeley alums who graduated in the early '90s and before have complained that Berkeley's student body has become much more conservative and ""corporate"" compared to what they experienced when they attended.

Pretty useful course, but watching YouTube videos isn't what I paid $8k for. Courseload is light and the teacher is helpful (but not compromising to students' plea for more time on the quizzes. I agree the given time is enough if you actually studied). Mark breakdown is brutal; mess up something and it'll haunt you for the rest of the term. Quiz structure is also unpleasant.

"It's Grade Grubbing Season. As many of you are probably in the same boat as me, in that, you're wrapping up the semesters and looking forward to some time away from work, there are a slew of students who only JUST NOW realized they're going to fail. Cue the ensuing comments begging to regrade assignments, name calling, and pity parties from students who messed up due to their own negligence, laziness, or apathy. Last night I had a particular individual email me past midnight from a student who, after receiving a zero on an assignment for repeated AI use, used every trick in the book to try and get me to change their grade. They went played ignorant on why they got their grade (I told them directly, and wrote about it on their paper), said they 'didn't care' until they got a zero (clearly), that I was a great professor and they were a 'terrible' student (pity plea), and reiterating that they don't care, but deserve a C or D in the class because they can't fail (despite having major issues with each paper, and never doing extra credit). It was a wild ride to read it all this morning, and just made me feel so relieved that I'll have a much needed break from teaching for the summer, because holy shit these students have been a wild bunch. Also, I probably won't be saying anything back to them because 1) everything they're asking for clarification on is written down on their work, and has been discussed with them numerous times, and 2) its an angry, venting email that they probably sent on a whim (considering when it was sent), and they're not going to get the outcome they want. Do I feel a little bad to see them potentially fail? Of course, I don't want any of them to fail! Most of us don't get into this work to see people suffer. However, am I going to ignore the several issues they had during the semester and give them a grade they didn't earn?

"Online professor potentially unfair grading practices what do I do. I recently got a failing grade for a major assignment and feel like it is on an unfair basis. First of all, she gave me nearly a whole page of feedback on pretty much every answer I gave. The feedback was mostly “why?” or “be more specific”. I followed the assignment instructions to a tee and it never explicitly mentioned that I was supposed to answer with that level of detail. Secondly, in multiple canvas announcements she mentioned that she would give us feedback on our assignment for us to revise. She graded my assignment 10 days past the due date so I had zero chance to revise. Since it was past the due date, I can’t resubmit to revise (according to “department policies” that I couldn’t find on Google). Third, she responded to an email of mine stating that she allows students to send her a rough draft for feedback in order to do well on the major assignments. This was never mentioned in both the syllabus and canvas. When I confronted her in a zoom meeting (I fully screen-recorded btw) she admitted to not advertising and telling her students. It’s basically a resource that is unavailable to the average student that you would only have access to if she feels like telling you about it. So far the only options I’ve thought of were to drop the class and try to find an 8-week course to fill the credit requirement. I already have a meeting with an advisor next week to handle this.

"Need help navigating academic issue. Sorry for the long text, I’m in a really tough spot with one of my classes and could use some advice. Recently, I came down with a sudden and severe allergy attack that covered 90% of my body in hives, making me too sick to take an exam on the scheduled day. I reached out to my professor two days in advance, explaining my situation and asking how to handle it, but I didn’t get a response until after the original exam. By then, I was too unwell to attempt it, and she ended up giving me a make-up exam, I was taking tons of antihistamines, was so drowsy. Initially, she didn’t even want to let me take a make-up exam, but eventually,after some drama involved,she did. Unfortunately, the make-up was in a completely different format—it was mostly essay-based, requiring complex, detailed answers. The original exam was primarily multiple choice, which would have been much more manageable. I feel like she intentionally made the make-up harder. I only scored a 47 on it, partly because I ran out of time. After complaining she went back and look at exam and tell me she had missed some essay and she is correcting the grade, changed from 47 to 55. This is especially frustrating because my other exams in this class averaged in the 80s. Due to a rule in the class, I need a 75% exam average to pass, which means that now, with this low score factored in, I’d need to score a 95.4 on the final. To put it in perspective, that means I could only miss three questions out of 75.if I score below 95.4 in the final I will fail the class. Adding to the frustration, I have ADHD and got approved for accommodations, including extra time. However, the approval came through the day after this make-up exam, so I couldn’t use any accommodations to help with the timing issue. Right now, I’m feeling extremely stressed, and it doesn’t seem like my professor is willing to help. The situation feels really unfair, especially because I would have tried the original exam despite being heavily medicated if I’d known the make-up would be so much harder. I’m not sure where to turn or what my options are. I’ve try to talk to the higher up like dean of instruction and my department head.

"Will I be expelled. Hi so this is going to be long as I want to explain my situation. Yes I’m a bad student and I deserve to get expelled. I recognise that, so please be kind in the comments. I’m being fully honest down below to give an idea. I have a second offence of academic misconduct going on - both collusion in online exams. My first offence was in 1st year of my undergrad course in which 5 of us (me and course mates) had colluded together on an online exam. We confessed. Since it was a first offence it was okay for us we had to redo the exam. After being caught the first time, 4 out of 5 of us still colluded in other online tests in our 2nd year. This is because my friend, let’s call her A (who’s also my flatmate) keeps influencing us. I did say the first time that I was scared and I’m not gonna do it with them, that they can cheat on the tests together but I’m out. I’m not doing it. Friend A would talk me into it each time I did this so it got to a point by the 3rd test I would just end up doing it with her fully willingly. I guess I got desensitised to the fear or by the third time I thought it’ll be fine. I wish I could’ve talk myself out of it. Trust me I regret it. Anyways, we finally got caught on this very small test. The day before that test she asked me to do it with her. I did strictly say no to her, that I won’t do it. That our professor even warned us not to do this. She was doing the whole talking me into it thing again but I completely ignored what she was saying and went about my day thinking she got the message that I didn’t want to do it. However on the day of the exam she knocked on my door and came in. I was really confused why she came when I specifically said no to her the day before. Because I feel intimidated by her (she can be rude to me) and thought she would talk me into it again.I didn’t say no. I really hate myself for being a people pleaser and not keeping a firm ground. The professor caught us and we denied it in the meeting out of fear of getting expelled since it’s our second time. I don’t really know what to do I’m so scared. The case has escalated to the Committee, I admitted to it in my statement and I wrote about how she came into my room. I didn’t write about the day before as I thought it looks like I’m blaming her because at the end of the day I did do it with her. I feel so scared like my life is over. I’ve been juggling caring responsibilities for both of my parents with my intense university course this year. I didn’t have these responsibilities in 1st year as my mom was looking after my dad but now they’re both ill. I’ve been taking steps to make sure when I go back to university I won’t have any caring responsibilities (I contacted social services for my parents to get help). I’m also struggling with really bad mental health which has gotten worse since this misconduct situation happened. Honestly I don’t even know why I’m posting this.I guess I need some advice? My university’s policy is that second offences lead to expulsion and only in the event of substantial mitigation will they consider a lesser penalty. I’ve been classed as an external student for the next academic year because the Committee takes 4 months to a year to reply back to set a hearing date.

"Sharing recent work news with professor. For context, I had a professor a few semesters ago who really helped stimulate my interest in legal writing through her assignments where we had to write a legal motion based on a fictional set of facts. In fact, the class was so beneficial that I was able to actually use the skills I learned as well as the actual motions as a stepping stone to write actual motions for the law firm I'm employed with. Because of how much I enjoyed the course, I decided to take that professor again this semester. One of the motions I recently wrote, which was rather intensive and a test of my skills I felt, was just filed with the court a few days ago and it was something I felt very proud about. Would it be strange or improper to email a copy of that motion to my professor, explaining that it was real-life work product I was able to achieve thanks to their course and thanking her for giving me the opportunity to write motions in her original course? I'm just unsure if it would come across as mooching since I'm still currently their student and the semester is ongoing. At the same time, I feel like waiting months until the semester ends to share the news would be weird too since it would lose its recency. I really do credit her original course for pushing me where I am today and just want to find the right way to express that. Am I just overthinking this? Edit: before anyone brings up confidentiality concerns, the motion is in fact public record at this point (i.e., literally any member of the public can search up the case and view it on the court portal), so that's not an issue I'm concerned with",Faculty,Medium,1.0,reddit:r/college,Medium,1,1646,306,6,Sharing recent work news with professor.,0
"Why am I not hearing ANYTHING from schools. I applied to six PhD programs for Clinical psychology and have only had two schools give me formal notices that I was not offered an interview. Of the other schools I applied two, I know that one (UIC) had their interviews and offered admission, and another (SDSU/UCSD joint program) is having their interviews today. A third school (UCI) offered their interviews. I did not get any formal letters nor emails from these three schools. I contacted the professors and did not receive a reply from UIC nor SDSU. However, I did get a reply from professors at UCI (they have been so helpful and kind). At UCI, they had a deep pool of applicants and I wasn't offered an interview because the two professors I applied to work with weren't priority for admitting students. One of the professors was also the director of UCI's new clinical program so I imagine that is a possibility for her not being considered priority. I still have not gotten a formal update from admissions though. Aside from that, I am still waiting for USC (the last school to which I applied). They have given me no updates other than they have received my transcripts. The professors have yet to answer me as well. My mind is boggled right now. Why haven't UIC and SDSU/UCSD given me official notice? I'm more curious about UIC since one of my friends was offered admission to the Clinical Psych program this application cycle. I know that they are finished or nearly finished with decisions. Is it possible that there might be a second wave of interviews? I know there is sometimes a waitlist for interviews. Having said that, why have I not gotten a notification that I was not offered an initial interview? There are no updates on the respective portals for these schools either.

"Grad school under reporting costs by $8k+. I’m in a competitive medical program that requires a certain amount of clinical/immersion hours. The program itself is fairly expensive and many of us are using a combination of traditional loans to pay for the courses and grad plus loans to help supplement our income and pay for living expenses etc as it is nearly impossible to work full time and maintain the grade point average required to stay in the program.

"Deranged, Unorganized Rantings of some Junior. It has probably been a complaint heard a billion times, but I do not know what I want when I apply to college. I may have an *idea,* but the concept of committing to one thing (major) or one year later after you join a college to me is a terrifying thought.

"Advice needed on when to give up on a manuscript and how to inform co-authors on giving up. tldr: I've been working on and off on a manuscript for nearly two years after my PhD. Thinking about giving up on it once and for all. How should I inform my co-authors? Long version: It's been almost two years since I completed my PhD. When I graduated, I was still working on a final manuscript to submit. While I wanted to submit the manuscript, a co-author still wanted me to do more work (adding more experiments) on the manuscript. I agreed to do this but at the same time I became extremely busy with my new job and never had time to complete those extra experiments. Recently my supervisor and co-author emailed me to continue with it as they would like to wrap it up. Now for the past three months I've been spending every weekend working on the new changes. It's exhausting as I can already barely keep up with my regular work and don't have the time now to rest on weekends. Furthermore, I don't really see how this manuscript is really relevant anymore. In fact, my previous manuscript on a similar topic only got a few citations. So now I am wondering if it's even worth the effort to work on this? Sacrificing my weekends and mental health to work on something that no one really cares about anymore, just for the sake of finishing it up. At the same time, I've already invested so much effort in this that if I give up now it would have been all for nothing. And then there is the problem of how to inform my co-authors about giving up on the manuscript. They have been very supportive of me and it feels like I'm letting them down.

Credible sources are usually published by reputable authors, academic journals, universities or recognized institutions and they provide evidence-based information that supports your arguments. Many students use platforms like [https://writeessaytoday.com/](https://writeessaytoday.com/) to learn how to identify and incorporate these sources effectively. Examples of credible sources include peer-reviewed journal articles, books from respected publishers, government reports and research papers from recognized experts in the field. Websites with clear authorship, citations and up-to-date information also count as reliable sources, while personal blogs, forums or unverified websites are generally not considered credible.

"Why is Formal Writing Disparaged Today. I don't agree with a college professor encouraging students to essentially ""dumb down"" their writing to appease a broader audience, though I understand the sentiment behind it. But that's a concept that belongs in a humanities class, not a class whose purpose is to instruct formal composition. I had no problem understanding your writing. It reads as if it could be an excerpt from an academic piece, which is the point. But it does also reads as if the ""formal"" words were chosen for the sake of being ""formal"". This could, at least in part, be due to the fact that this is a single paragraph, and would be less obvious if read as part of a whole. Even formal writing has a certain natural flow, and your word choices lend a certain ""clunkiness"" to the writing. It's not bad writing by any means. Refining the foundation you already have for academic writing is what your professor *should* be focusing on.

"Covering your ass. January of 2015 I requested that the Community College (hereafter referred to as CC) I attended seal my personal, student records. I had recently filed a restraining order against my former girlfriend, Ms. Doe who is employed as a security guard at CC. I was concerned that Ms. Doe would retaliate against me and that she would use her position as a security guard at CC to harass me when I was on campus attending classes. Throughout the time that the CC was allegedly looking into my claims of harassment, I was regularly harassed and abused by Ms. Doe. I presented all of the information documenting Ms. Doe’s harassment and abuse toward me, to CC and their response was to deny my claim and I was told I was lying. I was told that what I was experiencing was “not abuse” and “not retaliatory” by the CC. The CC's response to my request was to expel me from school. A short time after my expulsion, Ms. Doe resumed her harassment of me. I had blocked Ms. Doe from all social media applications but she utilized another form of social media (Google Plus) to privately message me. Ms. Doe disclosed to me the details regarding my case with the CC. Specifically that the CC had been actively working to keep me from resuming classes during their investigation. Ms. Doe used this information and the possibility that she had the leverage to get me back into school, as a means of control over me. I felt that I had no choice but to acquiesce to Ms. Doe's romantic overtures or else I would not be able to resume classes. During one of the ""dates"" Ms. Doe took me on, Ms. Doe disclosed information regarding other students who had been in similar situations as my own and the outcome of their cases with the school. For example: A student at the CC violently attacked his girlfriend (also a student at the CC) and broke her arm. This student (the aggressor) was immediately suspended but later allowed to resume his classes. This information was revealed to me by Ms. Doe as a demonstration of how much access she had to student's personal records. Ms. Doe informed me that she could get into my student records at any time. Ms. Doe often disclosed private information that she had obtained at work, to me in an attempt to both intimidate and/or impress me. Ms. Doe's missus of her access to private records was never addressed by the CC, and in fact she was never formally disciplined regarding any of her unprofessional behavior until a year later, when she was reprimanded for a completely separate infraction. I made the CC aware that Ms. Doe was divulging other student's private information to me but I was summarily ignored. My goal in writing this is to bring to light the glaring discrepancies in how the CC handles cases of domestic violence between students versus how they handle domestic violence incidents between students and employees. In the example given above, the student that broke his girlfriend's arm was suspended but then allowed to resume classes. In my situation the CC chose to ignore clear evidence of harassment and abuse in order to side with an employee. I simply requested that my record be sealed to keep my personal information private and out of the hands of my ex-girlfriend who had threatened my life and livelihood on a regular basis and my request was ignored by the CC. Instead of simply sealing my records they chose to go to extremes and expel me when I had done nothing that warranted expulsion. In this instance the CC determined that their employee was more valuable than a student",Examination,High,2.0,web:reddit:r/college:search:harassment campus,High,2,3544,628,5,Covering your ass.,0
"Struggling in landing an internship for the summer as a Junior. Considering grad school, advice needed. I am currently a junior, majoring in Finance and Economics with a minor in Computer Science. I have a GPA of 3.83 and, despite attending a non-target school (ranked #2 in Florida), I am aiming to work as an Asset Manager, Wealth Manager, Portfolio Manager, or Economist. Last summer, I interned at an automotive startup as a Financial Analyst, where I worked in FP&amp;A, Capital Management, and Research. However, I have not received any full-time offers except for a return offer from that same startup. So far, I’ve had only two interviews, both with Fortune 500 companies—one advanced to the second round, and the other ended after the first(not rejected in the portal but haven’t responded to follow up emails, it has been 3 months). I’ve practiced my interviewing skills extensively through mock interview resources and feel I’ve improved significantly, as I initially struggled with pressure and sometimes froze or stuttered. Although I have 10+ recommendations, they haven’t led anywhere, and the interviews I did get were from applying blindly. Right now, I’m considering further education. My school offers two one-year master’s programs—a Master’s in Finance and a Master’s in Applied Economics—that would be relatively inexpensive for me. I would graduate a semester early and could use part of my Bright Futures scholarship, so my tuition cost would max out at around $12,000, which I can afford. I also plan to begin studying for the CFA sometime in the next year. I’m wondering whether it’s worthwhile to pursue one of these master’s programs or if I should look at programs outside my current school. I plan to apply to the University of Florida’s Master of Finance program, where tuition would be similarly priced. I haven’t taken the official GRE yet, but I scored a 315 (161 Quant, 154 Verbal) on a blind practice test. I believe I could score 330+ with proper study. Should I consider applying to other schools, or skip the master’s altogether? My main goal is to land a well-paying job right out of college (in the $80–90k range), but without any internship lined up for this summer, I’m worried that won’t be feasible. I don’t want to pay $80k for grad school since neither my family nor I can afford that. In the meantime, I’ll continue applying to internships as many are still available.

"YOU CHOOSE – BUILD PUBLIC ALLIANCES OR COWER BEFORE TRUMP. It is striking that as the Trump administration attacks America’s research universities, demanding the return of millions of research dollars, few outside the university seem to come to their aid. The universities appear isolated. Why? Roughly a third of Americans interviewed in a 2024 Gallup/Lumina poll indicated they had little or no confidence in higher education. “We understand why many Americans don’t trust higher education and feel they have little stake in it,” the New York Times editorial board recently reported. “Elite universities can come off as privileged playgrounds for young people seeking advantages only for themselves. Less elite schools, including community colleges, often have high dropout rates, leaving their students with the onerous combination of debt and no degree. Throughout higher education, faculty members can seem out of touch, with political views that skew far to the left.” How might we effectively resist the current attacks? I suggest a way forward is to follow the example of Paul Farmer and Partners in Health – to build broad public alliances with key organizations beyond academia by demonstrating how our work benefits others and serves the broader social good in clear, concrete ways. We need show key figures in the broader society how the social sciences help solve other people’s problems. Our research is not about us, about advancing our careers. It is about helping frame solutions to key problems of the broader society that work, that benefit others, in noticeably ways.

"There are many programs that will not admit masters students directly. So you are vastly increasing your odds of acceptance by not mentioning the word ""masters"" in your application. For a thesis/dissertation program, there is a certain cost to ""onboard"" a grad student. It's more than just taking some classes. It takes about a year to get your feet under you as a grad student: taking placement exams, choosing a lab/advisor, getting your project started, and of course taking some classes as well as figuring out how to teach classes/labs (usually). These tasks apply to both masters and PhD students. However, a PhD student will stay for 4-6 years (or more), whereas a master's will stay for 2-3. So from the department's perspective it's just more cost-effective to bring people in who at least have the potential to have 3+ years of research productivity as opposed to 1-2. I wouldn't worry about ""taking"" a spot from someone else. It's not that big of a deal. Even if you ""took someone's spot,"" that person could always apply again the next year, or go to another program if they're truly qualified. If it's just a matter of confidence, then I would take your professors' advice and apply for the PhD programs.

"This is the biggest problem with people taking just straight statistics at face value. Let's take a budget of someone in California. * 300k post taxes is 190k for single filers * 3 bedroom apartment in a decent area of the bay area, let's say Santa Clara as we're talking about tech workers. That'll set you back 4700 a month, giving us 133k left to work with. Don't even get me started on if you own a house, because you also need to pay home insurance and upkeep * The average annual cost of premiums and health coverage in California for a family was 22k, leaving us with 111k left * Average cost to own 1 car(keep in mind, 1 car, not 2, not 3, 1) is on average 12k. Leaves us with 99k for 1 car. You can cut down further if you want. * Savings and retirement also need to be done. If you want to, you know, afford to live when you're older, you'll likely want to near max out that 401k. That leaves you with 76k left to play with * Childcare also exists. If you have any siblings, or need to pay for any sort of emergencies there, that's gonna cost you quite a lot. Average childcare costs in the bay are an eyewatering 22k per year, which ranges even higher with younger children. That gives us 54k left, give or take * Food is also something people need, you know, to eat. If you want to be very frugal, you can get away with under 1k, but if you're pulling in 300k it likely means you have not all that much time to cook and all, so we'll assume you eat out more than often and have to buy food at local stores instead of bulk costco runs a lot, so 1k a month. That cuts us down to 42k. * Of course, you also have all those things you need, like electricity, water, wifi, phone bills, and other utilities. These are not cheap in California. Average family pays down 2k a month nearly, which will definitely be true if you're a tech worker and need good connections, and if you're a family with a lot of devices. So, 18k left. * And I guess you have 18k a year to go around and buy clothes, emergency spends, savings, entertainment, and all other things. Just 18k a year. On a 300k salary. Of course, you can try to be frugal, save money here and there, but the reality of things is that California has been hammered by inflation I think your analysis misses one key point, right about here &gt;The MEDIAN household income is 80k! And you think something almost 4x that is the upper end of average? The median American nowadays is the poorest the median American has been in decades. 34% are fully paycheck to paycheck.

In that time, I've got a career in the DOC, I've started a family, and now I've thrown the chaos of college into the mix. I went to HR and asked about shift accommodations for my courses, I was in short denied. So I've gotta find a new job, that'll pay decent to help support my family, and work with my college hours. The reason I even did this college thing is because they offered a tuition promise, where if you made under 100k / yr, had less than 15k on the SAI, and were an instate resident, they'd cover the cost of tuition. It was on a deadline, so I jumped and took it, signed up and got accepted, and got an offer letter stating I qualified.

I am taking classes at my local community college to complete some missed credits from high school so that I can apply to college this fall. It's all a long story but I am basically taking two semesters of English and two semesters of History. Classes started on September 4th and I was actually in class from the first day. but on one of their satellite campuses. It wasn't a very good environment and I decided to transfer to their main campus after being sexually harassed. No, I was not being provocative, I didn't ask for it or expect it. I transferred to the same courses, they meet Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. I transferred in yesterday. My English professor is very strict. The first essay is due tomorrow. I did not start it yesterday when I could have, that is my fault. However, today I could not work on it because I had my driving test that we had scheduled months in advance. It was the only one that I could get between now and next July. I had to go all the way across the state for it and you know how long you have to wait at those places. Well, I didn't get home until now. I have to write this whole essay that every other student had a week to work on. It is supposed to include 3 to 4 rough drafts that had been developed over the week. obviously not just in one night. Additionally. this is from the syllabus: ""LATE PAPERS: Due dates are sacrosanct. Essays are due Friday. There are no acceptable reasons for late essays. It does not matter why it is late. I do not grant extensions to anyone for any reason. Why an essay is late is immaterial. If it’s late, I won’t accept it. Do not operate under the erroneous assumption that you can complete missing essays at the end of the semester. Do not ask for make-up work. Submit the essay early or on time. If that is not possible for one essay, move on to the next one. I do not accept late essays from anyone for any reason.""

"Idea on how to make ""textbooks"" ""free"". Make it an assignment to write a textbook section or sub-section, and then later years can use it and revise it. Kinda like an open github repository except for writing. Many people make very comprehensive notes for classes already anyway, and my uni also has volunteer note-takers. Obviously the quality wouldn't be as high as a usual textbook but since it works like wikipedia how everyone can edit, it should be clear enough. Open source might even be more comprehensive. This would be a really meaningful assignment too since it's something that actually makes an impact. Also it can be a very organized ""discussion board"", like the wikipedia discussion boards. And it would be specific to the class, which would be helpful for future students taking the class too. Some classes in my uni already write their own course notes, i can understand if profs dont release it publicly bc it took so much effort to write, but if student publish these things as homework i dont see the problem.

"Live quiz or not. I run a course with a challenging group of students. Attendance is between 30%-40% and the pass rate for the exam is about the same. This is not course specific, but a general issue throughout the program. Most students don’t give a f**** about their studies, theyall have a job or other obligations and the 3-year study program seems to take most students 6 years or more (except for that 30% that goes to class). I have managed to improve the students performance over the past semesters and one of the latest additions of my course is regular mandatory quizes on the topic that was covered the week before. Students need to have 40% correct on each test to get credits for this course element (so the bar is rediculously low). If they have less, they need to do an extra assignment. It motivates some students to study a little bit during the course. I always emphasize it’s not an exam. They can use course material, but they need to solve questions within a limited time frame. If you have looked at the course material, the entire test is easy peasy. If you have to google each question, you might struggle to answer within the time frame. I’m wondering if I should run it live on Zoom (using Menti) or just have an online quiz (using Testportal) that is available for them to take during a designated time frame. On Menti, I know the students can easily cheat. Everyone gets the same question and answers. Nothing stops them from texting the correct answer to each other. But, I can guide them through the correct answer, highlight why some answers were incorrect and it gives a little bit more of a learning experience to this element. On Testportal, I can randomize all questions and answers, and leave them on their own. Of course they can still look up the right answer, but at least that still requires them to look it up and is probably more than what they usually do. But it feels more boring, less of a learning experience and more of a test. Any insight? Any experience with both or any of the options? So far I have come up with the following idea: I start the quiz on Menti at the exact scheduled time. Any student that is late or claims to be not able to connect to Menti, gets a link to Testportal and does the quiz there",Attendance,Medium,1.0,web:pullpush:r/academia:submission:attendance,Medium,1,2259,416,2,Live quiz or not.,0

"How to pick yourself up again after experiencing unmotivation. I feel like i’m stuck in a constant cycle of um motivation and self sabotage currently. A little backstory, throughout my whole life I have always been super motivated and goal oriented. I have always made amazing grades while maintaining my position in sports teams. So since i’ve gotten to college this motivation has gotten a bit wavery but I still get good grades, I just thought it may be the affects of burnout. Now going into this new semester of college I feel like a complete idiot. This summer I have been experiencing brain fog and for the first time in my life I was forgetting such simple things, and this has never happened before because my memory has always been amazing. I started doubting myself a lot more this summer, I started my first job and I felt like I couldn’t do anything right without someone showing me exactly step by step what to do. In the beginning of this job I felt so mentally tore down because I kept making mistakes and my managers were rude so their feedback would just make me feel worse. But I eventually got better at my tasks. Now I am going into this semester of college still feeling these feelings of self doubt and brain fog. I’m in a math class, and the teacher doesn’t teach so you kind of have to learn everything on your own time. This has been terrible for me because I get stuck giving my all in different classes besides this one because it would take extra effort for me to learn all the math by myself. The problem has now become, I don’t teach myself anything, i turned a couple assignments late didn’t do too good on an exam and now for the first time in my life i have a low F in the class. In a different class i’m taking since it’s also a hard class and I have troubles paying attention in class to take notes I also tend to neglect this class. So I missed a couple assignments and also for the first time in my life I have a D in that class. Even in my other classes I give my all in I miss an assignment or two and I have low A’s in those. These are the worst grades I have ever had in my life and I refuse to end my semester with anything other then A’s and B’s. But I have 0 motivation to do anything about the two classes I have low grades in because I feel like I did too much damage. On top of that I just feel like an idiot because when I do have free time I just get stuck in a constant loop of sleeping and tiktok and telling myself “don’t worry i’m 30 minutes i’m going to get up and do something about my grades” and i don’t do anything.

"Shadow ""Accommodations"", Loopholes, Out of Control. Writing out of desperation. Obviously many posts about accommodation abuse by student or institution, often with replies indicating the demands are not ""reasonable""=problem addressed or grounds to push back. But I'm bombarded by pseudo-accommodation demands from the very disability/mental support offices that decline to grant them/admit they are unreasonable.

"Wanting to study in the US as an international student is like visiting someone’s house as an overnight guest: if you want to be welcomed with open-arms, you really need to bring something. That something will need to be one of two things: - An extraordinary amount of academic ability, or - An extraordinary amount of money Ideally, of course, you’d bring both. Note that many people — especially international students — seem to use the terms “scholarship” and “financial aid” interchangeably, when they often aren’t the same thing in many cases - “scholarship” usually denotes money given based on academic merit - “financial aid” usually denotes money given based on need-based factors It’s a fine point that is worth understanding. There are roughly 2,600 four-year schools in the US. When it comes to financial aid/merit scholarships for international students, they each pretty much fall into one of five buckets: 1. **Need-Blind, Full-Need Met** — these schools do not consider an international student’s ability to pay when making admissions decisions, and will meet 100% of your demonstrated financial need if you are accepted. There are only ten of these schools: Harvard, Yale, Princeton, MIT, Amherst, Dartmouth, Bowdoin, Brown, Notre Dame, and Washington &amp; Lee. These schools are extraordinarily competitive private schools, which reject the vvast majority of international and domestic applicants based on academics and other non-financial criteria. Only two of these schools provides merit scholarships (ND and W&amp;L) but they are extremely limited and extremely competitive. 2. **Need-Aware, Generous** — these schools (25 or so?) do consider an international student’s ability to pay when making admissions decisions, so you will need to be an extraordinarily qualified applicant to overcome that impediment. (Like, essentially good enough to get into the Harvard, Yale, Princeton, etc tier schools in the first bucket.) but, if you do get in, these schools will meet 100% of your demonstrated financial need. Personally, I have a problem calling any school “generous” that rejects most international students simply based on their need for aid… but most people will characterize these schools as “generous to international students.” 3. **Need-Aware, Not-So-Generous** — these schools (25 or so?) also consider an international student’s ability to pay when making an admissions decision. But they are typically less selective than the 2nd group. (But you will still need to be an extremely qualified applicant to get accepted.) If accepted, these schools might offer partial scholarships/aid, but you should plan to cover much of the cost of attending on your own. 4. **Need-Aware, No-Money** — these are mostly private schools that consider an international student’s ability to pay when making admissions decisions, and will simply reject you if you cannot fully pay your own way. 5. **Need-Don’t-Give-A-Shit** — the rest of the schools in the US — including every public university — don’t consider your need for financial aid one way or the other. Which is to say that they will happily admit international (and domestic) applicants who cannot possibly afford to attend… and then provide them no need-based aid whatsoever. There are a relative handful that do provide partial merit-based scholarships, but rarely full-rides. Ultimately, however, getting admitted to a school you can’t afford to attend is no better than being rejected. The unfortunate reality is that, statistically speaking, the likelihood of an international applicant needing significant aid being accepted to a US university that is willing to meet their financial need is extraordinarily low",Fees,Medium,1.0,web:pullpush:r/ApplyingToCollege:comment:problem,Medium,1,3693,573,7,"Wanting to study in the US as an international student is like visiting someone’s house as an overnight guest: if you want to be welcomed with open-arms, you really need to bring something.",0

"Student. Student Life: The Foundation of the Future Student life, or the period of a scholar's journey, is a crucial chapter in every person's existence. It is not merely about gaining academic qualifications within the walls of a school or university; rather, it is a transformative journey of self-discovery, growth, and maturation from childhood into responsible adulthood. The experiences gathered during this time fundamentally determine what kind of person one will become in the future. The Pursuit of Knowledge and Wisdom The core principle of student life is the acquisition of education and knowledge. This is the phase where one learns about the world, achieves proficiency in various subjects, and develops the ability to solve problems. However, education is not confined to just reading books and passing exams. It is about broadening one's perspective, cultivating critical thinking skills, and fostering the curiosity to innovate and create new things. Exploration and Personality Development Beyond academics, student life is rich with opportunities for personal growth. It is during this time that deep friendships are forged, a sense of responsibility is instilled, and one's personality begins to truly flourish. Through sports, cultural events, and various clubs, a student learns vital lessons on teamwork, effective communication, and leadership. These diverse experiences are incredibly valuable for success in future professional and personal lives. Challenges and Duties Student life is not all fun and excitement; it also brings its share of challenges and duties. Dealing with the pressure of exams, navigating competition among peers, and making life-altering decisions about one's future career path are all hurdles students must face. They must learn the essential skill of time management and how to prioritize their commitments effectively. The Cornerstone for Success In essence, student life serves as the cornerstone upon which the rest of one's life is built. The student who utilizes this time wisely, studies with dedication, and works on character development will emerge as an educated, responsible, and impactful citizen in society. The successful future they desire is fundamentally determined by the discipline and effort they invest during these foundational years",Academic,Medium,1.0,web:reddit:r/students:search:exam schedule problem,Medium,1,2309,345,0,Student.,0

"To Renew or Not Renew. I teach in a cash-cow program plagued by widespread cheating, fraud, and dishonesty. I've enforced the student conduct code as expected, but the pushback has been intense—possibly jeopardizing my contract. The clearest evidence is in my student evaluations: only 15 out of 130 submitted them, with half being scathing (e.g., ""evil,"" ""condescending,"" ""incompetent""). These reviews appear orchestrated, likely from students caught cheating. The evidence supporting this is that they all use my full name, without Prof/Dr in the third person. Usually evals have a mix of Prof X, X, Dr X, ""the professor"" etc. Many students lack basic English proficiency, which leads to misunderstandings and academic struggles. Some don't know the numbers 1 thru 9, others don't know the difference between a period and a slash (it's a programming class). Some likely cheated on the TOEFL and now rely on further dishonesty to get by. I don't feel supported by the program. My teaching evaluations have fluctuated wildly, and my supervisor attributes it to changes in admission standards over required technical skills—changes I was never informed about. This quarter, I’m teaching a new course that has been a disaster. The last lecturer was fired, yet students later gave him a teaching award. It seems faculty decisions are driven by student complaints rather than clear, university-set standards. Students don’t meet the bar, faculty try to help them reach it, and then we get retaliated against. It doesn't help that in order to teach this class, I had to take on a 150% FTE workload on top of a full time job. My formal peer teaching evaluation was 23/24 and I got dinged for typos and class attendance/engagement. The subjective narrative at the top of the evaluation was far less positive. It was basically ""the program would collapse without him. It's hard to find anyone to teach this class in a B school.""

"I rushed, and I regret it (an alumnus' perspective). Hey everybody. I'm 23M, and I graduated last year. I was in a frat, and I was very popular. I had leadership positions within Greek life and the house I was in specifically. My resume found great success, but I'm hear to say that - despite what your parents have said about their greek life experiences, despite what those energetic friends of yours are saying about greek life, despite what you see on barstool sports, and despite my opening couple of sentences - **please, please,** ***please*** **don't rush your freshman year if you can help it at all**. Honestly, whatever floats your boat, but if you're not the type to drink all the time, give zero shits about classes (and, by proxy, your future), or generally not care greatly about yourself and your life - please reconsider rushing, period. I rushed because my dad pushed me to do so. He was in a frat, and is obsessed with his time in college, even now, over 40 years later. I never understood the draw, but I figured that if my literal father figure had such positive experiences, it couldn't hurt me either. It did. It did badly, and in unseen ways. I didn't take the time to learn myself first, and spend some uncomfortable time alone in college, getting to know myself and my interests. Instead, I jumped headfirst into a centuries-old culture of abuse and strict hierarchy (both formally and socially), thinking it would be different because my frat said that they were 'not like the rest', and to their credit, for a bit they weren't. Then the school year started. To give you a quick rundown: \- For the first semester, I effectively had another full-time class: the frat. Yes, they assigned homework, and we had mandatory meetings each week, with drills after each meeting to see what we knew. I say drills and laugh, because here's what it actually was: all of us (new members, not yet initiated mind you) on our feet in the dark basement in front of a fireplace, screaming at the top of our lungs the information we were expected to know. Our frat wasn't as abusive as others on campus, but if you got something wrong, you stood in front of the fire, and for each time thereafter you got something wrong, you took a step closer to the fire. One guy's pants started smoking, just from having to stand in front of the flames (which were constantly made larger). This was once a week, for the entire first semester of college (oh, and you're in a suit for this too. You'll see the pledges on campus - khakis, white shirt, blue jacket, red tie, and complete exhaustion in their eyes). \- After initiation, nothing changes. You're not special, and in fact, people are less interested in you, because you're not someone who can be bullied as easily anymore. However, bullying and harassment are still rampant. Get ready to keep your porcupine quills up the whole time you're there, because if there's one thing that a group of toxic, insecure people are always looking for, it's the next downward punching bag. Oh, but if you defend the person getting bullied, you get sucked into the fold, too. I mentioned I was popular - I used this 'soft power' to step in and defend as many people as I could, but something else about frats - if the bullying gets exposed, they just get better at hiding it. It's an absolutely brutal and immature loop that honestly only gets more complicated as the years of college go on. It's not a game you can win unless you physically throw down (which everyone wants to do already) or leave. \- There is no academic support, there is no alumni network, there are no job perks after college. I don't give a shit what the promo stuff they give you says. Those are for the guys who rush at frats where their daddies are big contributors, and almost only for those guys. If you find something, it's blind luck. Also, even if there are alumni looking to hire - ask yourself if they're really people you want to work for and with. Are they actually different from the people you so despise now, or are they just older versions of those guys? (I'll tell you right now, 9/10 times it's the latter). The houses say they have study hours and study times - try getting work done. I dare you. For several months, I literally spent more hours in the library on campus than I did almost anywhere else. Maybe that's typical. But is it such a crime to want to work peacefully at the place you reside? The alumni network consisted of whoever the fuck showed up on gamedays, and they were always piss hammered anyways, so it didn't matter what you said to them. They weren't going to remember you. \- The culture is drinking. That's it. That's literally it. I want to elaborate, but doing so would only dilute this point. I abstained from drinking for the sake of self-improvement after my first semester freshman year, and found myself almost immediately devoid of any relatable group of people. It was really weird, actually. People treated me like I had a problem because I *didn't* drink like a fish. Now, these are the biggest four. I could go on for ages, but that's to be saved for my therapist. I'll also say that, yes. I chose to do this. Yes, I chose to pay $900 a semester and $500+ a month for rent, just to be miserable. Yes, I could have gotten out! But then do what? I'd have to find housing and the money to pay for it, for one - while paying for the frat, because you're locked into year long lease contracts at the house if you want to (or can) live there. How did it hurt me in unseen ways, you ask? It's a hard one to articulate, but it definitely has to do with not feeling fit in at all for four years without feeling like there was any out, while having a full courseload, while working weekends and any spare time at all to support yourself (I had to pay dues and most of rent myself), so no time to socialize in the only way the only people around you seem to know how. I've spent this past year debriefing/reeling/trying to process my college experience and figure out who the fuck I actually am because I didn't get that chance (or, rather, give myself that chance) in college. Now, I want to be very clear. It's very easy for the older ones of us to look back at this life and be like 'well, duh. of course a frat is going to be that way.' how do you know that? how *did* you know that? how would those who don't or didn't have positive role models, or any at all, know that, before going to college? And before I hear 'just look it up online', politics has shown us that that just doesn't fucking work. If you've made it this far, thanks for the read. If you're on your way to college, think twice about rushing. If you've already rushed, don't beat yourself up, but still do some thinking about where you are, who you are, where you want to go, and who you want to be, and if the organization you've joined will actually help you get there, or only create more swamp to trudge through in pursuit of your goals. edit: ""*- if the bullying gets exposed, they just get better at hiding it.*"" this is why frat rituals/the frat itself is/are so secretive. You don't talk publicly about things you're embarassed to be doing. edit 2: ""*Yes, I chose to pay $900 a semester and $500+ a month for rent, just to be miserable.""* This was the cheapest option on my campus at the time. There were scant financial support opportunities on my campus for those who were financially insecure. I ask for your consideration - what would they do? EDIT 3 - AND THIS ONE IS IMPORTANT: I forgot to talk about the rampant - R A M P A N T - homophobia in Greek Life. Like it's actually insane. Speaking for frats specifically here, everyone has such an inflated ego that everyone thinks that everyone is hitting on them - including the dudes - and because these are the ultra-dude-bro type, no homo was the name of the game. To the Nth power. We had a couple of openly gay guys in the house when I first got there, which was cool. Everyone was too afraid to talk to them because they were too afraid of being perceived as gay. They all dropped in-mass when they realized how much the guys in the house fucking hated gay people. This was because those guys stopped hiding it, and the rest of the house didn't care enough to stand up for them (I was only one person, mind you, in the face of 100+). I really can't say that their safety was ensured, but thank God they never stayed at the house for long enough to find out. If you're unsure as to your sexuality, there's nothing wrong with that - just please be really, really careful around frats.

"This is the approach I'm taking as well. I've used some pre-existing items on my rubric as ways to penalize written work I highly suspected was AI-generated but the case wasn't slam-dunk enough that I felt confident my administration would back me up if a complaint was raised. Next fall, I'm being more intentional about building in these sorts of items into rubrics. Some ideas I have used or am considering using, with alternate wordings: * The assignment is indicative of deep/careful thought/reflection/consideration. (If I get strong AI vibes, that indicates to me that the student didn't think/reflect/consider very deeply/carefully.) * The vocabulary/structure/design of the assignment is appropriate for the discipline/genre/format/audience. (AI can write to spec if asked, but the types of students who rely most heavily on AI are unlikely to go through the effort to ask.) * The argument/chronology/narrative/report reads/flows smoothly and naturally. (*Natural* is an antonym for *artificial*, so anything AI-like could be considered flouting this item. Plus, raw AI output is often awkward and stilted.) * The assignment follows/meets all the instructions/specifications. (If one of the instructions is ""Don't have AI write your assignment for you,"" then this item can be invoked easily. Of course, if the student asks which instruction they didn't follow and you tell them it was the no-AI one, you might get dragged into a formal process anyway. But that assumes they'll ask, and heavy AI-users are also less likely to attend closely to the rubrics they get back.) P.S.: Implicit ""plea bargains"" can be effective. My plagiarists (of human or AI sources) tend to be much more willing to accept 0s or other grade penalties if a) they believe the outcome could have been significantly worse and b) they fear that protesting could bring about a worse outcome. When I call out a first-time cheater via email, I tell them that I've decided not to report them to the Office of Student Conduct ""at this time.""

"I don't know how much longer I can take this. I'm (26F) in my second year of my PhD program. It's been very rough. I spent the last 1.5 years going through a lot of scary medical events and now I'm being diagnosed with a rare disease that will make me blind, deaf, negatively impact my heart (i.e., heart failure and/or possible heart transplant), nerves, and all the muscles in my body. The medical stress is one thing alone, but it's how my advisor treats me is what is bringing my to my breaking point. I've known my advisor for a few years--before I even started this program. Has he aggressively yelled at me several times since I started working with him? Sure, but I just assumed that was normal and never questioned it. (Apparently you should not be getting yelled at, at all!) While undergoing my testing for my medical issues, I had to communicate with him what was going on because I was missing a lot of meetings for appointments. He had a full understanding of the extent of my condition. Despite that, it didn't stop him from making insensitive comments about my body that were affected by my disease, constantly bothering me to provide him medical updates every single time I talked to him, telling the entire graduate department about my health issues without my consent, and making me do lab work I was physically uncomfortable and borderline unable to do. Despite these hiccups, things only seem to get worse. The thing is, I NEED health insurance. My advisor admitted to me last week that he gave the rest (3-4 years) of my funding to one of his other students. Since I am without funding at the moment, I am at risk of losing my health insurance as soon as this January. It all became so helpless that I had no one else to discuss this to but with one of the graduate deans of my university. He was in shock over what I was telling me and strongly encouraged me to switch advisors. The tough part is that I LOVE the research projects I'm working on with this advisor and even if I change advisors, there will still be no funding available for the rest of my program. It's like. do I endure this abuse or completely change my academic route and have to start over, doing something I'm not as passionate about? It gets more complicated because the dean recommended me to reach out to the director of my graduate program. I explained to him that she is on sabbatical and that the person who is temporarily taking her spot is best friends with my advisor. It's impossible to have this conversation with anyone else at this point. I've been emphasizing so much on maintaining confidentiality because I 100% know my advisor will either a) retaliate against me or b) make it harder for anyone else to advise me if he found out I was telling others about the way he's been treating me. Things have also gotten bad where I'm now being told things could potentially brought to a legal level. My advisor has a strong habit of gaslighting, lying, and not taking accountability for what he does or says. He's smart enough to not leave a papertrail. I began recording our conversations without his knowledge (legal where I live) and I'm just trying to protect myself at this point. It's just so hard? And the fact that it comes down to me having to go this route? I was encouraged to speak with others at the university to secure me disability accommodations so my advisor cannot force me to do work I have a hard time completing. But other than that, there are no other solutions other than go to my university union and see how they can help me. But truthfully, I don't even know the right person to go to anymore. I spent this weekend driving 7 hours to an academic conference (that is this upcoming week). There are about five of his other students in his lab who are going. All of the money paying for accommodations, fees, etc. for every student are being pulled from my funding budget for next semester. My advisor kept telling me how tight the funds were in this financial account and I felt so guilted into paying for the trip out of my own pocket so I don't lose more of my potential funding. About $700 later, here I am about to go to a conference I don't even think I want to be at anymore. It's hard enough to walk on eggshells with my advisor, but it's even harder to be surrounded with his students who have told me they don't believe he's treating me the way he does. It's so isolating and difficult to not even be heard, but believed. I don't know if it would just be better at this point to switch advisors and do research I'm not passionate about anymore. I'm also scared because I think my current advisor will still need to be on my thesis committee since I already finished two research projects with him. Sigh. I really don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I'm being kicked down from every aspect of life. But this part is truly the worst thing I have ever experience in my academic career. Part of me is like, ""I should just drop out"" but I know that's what he wants me to do--and I refuse to give in.

"I was also a first generation student and my family largely didn't graduate highschool and was strongly opposed to me going to college. The challenges you're facing are not a reflection of any innate ability to do (or not do) college. It is hard, but comparing yourself to others is pretty impossible. You only hear what others say--they may be exaggerating, or only telling you these things when it does happen to go well. You get a partial view. When I was in college I thought I was the worst of the pack, but now that I am a prof I see that the ""floor"" isn't where I thought it was, you just don't see all the students who are failing their classes or barely scraping by with all D's. Those students don't talk about it, but they exist. There are lots of things you can do, take advantage of the counseling center, tutoring center, academic support services offices, students first gen/working class groups, and more. However, all those things can be overwhelming. Here are my top recommendations in order of priority: (1) Build relationships with your professors. Even if you're at a large school with huge classes, you can do this. Go to office hours, starting with the _very first one_. Probably you won't have any assignments due yet, but that doesn't matter. Take a notebook with notes of what questions you want to ask (professors will be very impressed by this preparation). Go and ask any conceptual questions you have about the content up to then. Look them up on the website and see what you can find about their research, ask them something about that if you're interested. Ask what study strategies they suggest students use to be successful in their class. Then, _keep going back_ to office hours. Doesn't have to be every single week, but at least every other week. (2) Find other first generation/working class students. I went to a very wealthy private college before there was as much focus on supporting first gen students in college, so I very much relate to the ""everyone else is rich"" feeling, but there are probably at least a handful of other first gen students. Find them, there may be a student group or club about it and this might be a good starting point. If you can't figure it out on your own, ask your advisor or dorm RA or even counseling center. Having other people who understand was so important to keeping me in college. (3) If you are working your ass off, there is a real risk that you are using study strategies that worked in HS but are not very efficient in college. Asking professors how to study for their classes (and actually doing that!) and going to office hours regularly with any questions you have will help TONS, but you should also seek out study groups. Work together with other students, discuss the material, quiz each other.

"Appealing Academic Suspension. I received a dismissal letter and was hoping you guys could proofread it. I already submitted this letter to the committee. Dear Undergraduate Studies Committee, I am writing to appeal my dismissal from the XXX. Despite this, this news is quite devastating, although not shocking. I am writing this appeal in hopes that I am granted to be reinstated early before the Spring semester begins. First, I would like to thank the XXX university for the opportunity for me to appeal this decision. The first semester in college as a first year (freshman) was challenging to manage, as I worked full-time and attended university full-time. I actively made the decision to work 40 hours a week, having shifts starting at 4 am and ending at noon. This extremely tight timetable negatively affected my sleep schedule and left me fatigued and unable to concentrate on my academic work. Lack of sleep affected my memory; hence, I could not hold information well while working on assignments or preparing for exams. Nonetheless, I have failed to meet the minimum 2.0 GPA due to the challenges I faced with balance. Knowing it threatened academic pursuits, I decided to terminate my position in late October to prioritize my academics moving forward. Part of the reason I worked long hours was to help pay for my tuition and other expenses. However, I received financial support from my parents, which helped meet my financial needs, and thus, I would not need to work while studying at the university. This offsetting cost will enable me to concentrate on learning and maximize my academic performance. Also, I have visited a counselor for the mental issues that I had in the course of this period, and I shall continue with this care as I go on. I take full accountability for my choices and their consequences on my academic career. I could not handle the pressure of my job and sleeplessness, which made me fail to concentrate and get the energy needed for study. However, I have learned from this experience. I am determined to make meaningful changes to prevent such circumstances from occurring again and to utilize my full potential to achieve the academic goals I have set for myself. My plan to improve academically is to retake my low-performing courses in the spring. I plan to retake XXX course to replace the initial low grade and increase my GPA by improving my performance in the course. I also plan to take XXX course in the fall of the next academic year as it is an exclusive fall course. I am adjusting my schedule to ensure that I satisfy the core requirements and am prepared to complete a B.S. of science with a major in economics, as that is what I plan to pursue at the College of XXX when I reach the minimum GPA requirements. Changes I have made to my personal life, which I have already implemented in my routine, include maintaining a consistent sleep schedule without the demands of a full-time job. I want to ensure that I am well-rested and better equipped to handle my academic responsibilities now that my sleep cycle is uninterrupted. I will devote my time and energy to my coursework, utilizing study periods after lectures and a healthy sleep schedule. I will use academic support services, such as tutoring and counseling at XXX (biweekly meetings), to ensure I have the necessary resources and guidance to reach my educational goals. I will constantly contact my counselor and faculty to ensure I achieve my academic goals. I will create a distraction-free study routine by using spaces like the library and various study rooms in my dorm building, a practice I have already begun by routine. I will regularly contact my professors and academic advisors to track my progress and address any challenges if they arise. I shall state that even though my academic performance was not adequate this semester, this is not representative of my academic abilities as a student.

"Appeal for Grade. Hi everyone, I'm currently in a tricky situation and need any advice/help. This is my first semester going into College and first time ever failing a class. I'm feeling pretty bummed out as I usually get decent grades and have in my other classes. This class that I failed, is only offered once a year, which makes me ineligible to graduate in the next three years like planned. I believed I failed the class by a few percent or even less, it was very close. I want to appeal for my grade to my dean as I believe that one of my mark's was graded very poorly and unfair and I've been informed my professor about it and he did nothing. Anyways, about 1-2 months ago, we were assigned our first group project which was worth 20-25% towards our final grade. I ensured that I remained active through communication and attended meetings for our group. This group project was due in class on October 21st. Our professor told us to choose a group leader that would basically make sure that everything goes smooth and that they would submit the project to him. We set a ""date"" for our group members including I, to try and submit our parts of the assignment on October 18th, a few days before the actual due date so we could give our selves extra time to apply any changes or fix any issues that occurred. Essentially so we would be safe to apply changes before the due date on October 21st. October 18th rolls in and I inform my group that I need an extra night to fully be done my part as I wasn't satisfied with what I had completed. I didn't want to submit something that I wasn't confident in and I made sure that I gave them a heads up previously. None of them replied to my message regarding what I stated which made me feel a bit uneasy. The next day, October 19th rolls in and my entire part was deleted out of the blue. Note that we all worked on our parts of the project on one shared Word document. I'm sending messages in our group chat regarding how my entire part was deleted from the project and I get no reply except from the leader ""Guys it was supposed to be done yesterday"". Note that this is what they send me after I get no reply regarding how I needed an extra night to finish up my part. Clearly we could afford the extra time as we set ahead a date to try and get our parts of the project done. I then get another reply from one of my group members stating exactly, ""With all the respect if u don’t restart and get it done nothing good is going to come out of that. so try to do ur part pls i have already completed three parts of it for u"". Now I'm frustrated about this whole situation. I think I have an idea of who deleted my part and they are basically exposing themselves by saying that they completed parts of my assigned work. I didn't ask or need help with my work and now it's all gone because of them. They gave me absolutely no communication whatsoever that they would complete my part on my behalf. I didn't even need any help to begin with as I was nearly done. Even my other group members were trying to calm down everyone by saying that we will be okay and have everything done in time. They then had the balls to ask me directly, ""saleem can u guy at least try to finish up what’s left of part 1 section 1 question two?"" Then they stated, ""just be more mindful for the next group project because we’re deffo going to have more in probably most of our classes"". So basically I only got to answer one super small question from the project that was worth nearly nothing. The thing that really throws me off is that some of my other group members didn't even finish their part on time. They gave no communication that they needed extra time previously and finished their part days later. The group leader didn't accuse them for being late and actually congratulated them for finishing it. To make matters worse, the only area that we did horrible on was the part that I was assigned for the project and how my they deleted my part and wrote whatever what was on their mind. So the teacher blamed me for this even though I told him that they wrote this and how my part was deleted. I'm not sure if this was targeting or anything but it really wasn't fair at all. We got our grades back and I received around a low 30-40% if I recall correctly (he closed the course for students to enter). This heavily impacted my mark and most likely resulted me to just fail the course. I actually messaged the professor in October and asked him if we could meetup and discuss what went wrong. I have proof of the messages and everything needed to back me up but he didn't even check them at all. All he did was basically blame me for needing an extra night to finish my part even though I gave notice and we told him that we could afford extra time if needed as we gave ourselves extra time to begin with so that we had room for improvements. He didn't even consider that some of my other group members submitted their parts days later with no communication previously stating that they needed the extra time. Their part wasn't deleted and the group leader congratulated them instead of being angry. To conclude, he didn't change my mark and I couldn't do anything about it. Oh yeah, guess what, the other group members who submitted much later than me, received a way better mark. Please guys, any advice or help is recommended as I really feel like I was completely screwed over on this project and now I need to wait an entire year to take one course over again.

"Don’t be afraid to ask for extensions. Just some advice to anyone else with time management issues, poor mental health, or anything else that may cause you to wind up scrambling at the last minute to turn in your assignments. I get it, you procrastinated and/or convinced yourself you’d have enough time and now you’re suddenly panic-writing an essay as if your life depended on it. Most of us don’t like telling our profs that we’ve messed up, because it can be embarrassing to admit. If you’re anything like me, you avoid communicating with profs at all about your shortcomings because that conversation is super intimidating. But ultimately profs aren’t super concerned about their students being perfect - they’re here to teach and help us get degrees, and from my experience they prefer when a student reaches out for help rather than them failing. Profs are being especially generous now during the pandemic, but I realized even before that profs tend to be much more laid back about extensions than most of us students realize. I’ve asked for extensions plenty of times in university, and I’ve never once had a prof deny one. If you bother to ask politely, it seems that most profs don’t mind giving an extra day to complete something. It’s a lot better than turning in something late, and dealing with a late penalty - giving a heads up that you won’t finish something on time is rewarded more than getting it in late with no prior communication. Even if your profs aren’t the types to grant extensions, it *really* doesn’t hurt to ask. One time I was almost in tears trying to finish a 20 page research paper worth most of my grade. I sent an email asking for an extra day to finish (citing my mental health at the time, which was bad), and my prof gave me a whole week and wished me well. I ended up getting an A, and was able to go to sleep early that night and focus on taking care of myself. Tip: if you’re asking for an extension, suggest a reasonable timeline. Let them know you’ve made progress, something got in the way, and you will be able to get it in within the next day. Don’t ask for an extra week to finish something - that’s ridiculous, unfair to other students and could put your prof behind on their grading. Usually I just ask if I can submit something the next morning (if it’s due at midnight). Generally they give me more time than I ask for anyways, but you never want to come across entitled or unreasonable asking for a little grace",Fees,Medium,1.0,web:reddit:r/college:search:unfair grading,Medium,1,2466,447,7,Don’t be afraid to ask for extensions.,0

"Should I bring up my (physical and mental) health issues in the additional info section on common app. So for some backstory, I was a pretty strong student until 2024, but then my grades dropped because some of my family members’ health declined and I had to step up and take care of a lot at home. After that, I had my own health issues, both physical and mental and as a coping mechanism, I ended up maladaptive daydreaming a lot (like to an insane degree, it was basically an addiction). Now, I stopped the daydreaming thing and my grades are climbing again (not fully back to where they were, but definitely improving). I’ve heard sometimes AOs reject students if they seem mentally unstable, and I’m kinda worried. How do I express to AO's that this was just a one-off thing and that I have fully recovered? How do I write about my issues without making it sound like excuses?

"RateMyProfessors &amp; Harassment/Toxicity - HELP. Hi all, I am looking for screen captures of any sort of problematic content from RateMyProfessors - hate, defamation, untrue accusations, clear bias, stereotypes, sexualization. Long story short, I have been harassed there for almost two years and have received over 50 negative posts. It started off being about my sexual orientation (""homosexual urges,"" to be exact) and then progressed to claims I do not respect disability law (very untrue). Now I am getting posts about Hitler and the master race (I am Jewish, but have made no comments on Israel/Palestine so this is simply based on my identity). These posts have all been deleted but I have had to fight for their deletion many times. More problematic, they keep coming - often times one after the other in nearly identical words and then again months later with a new theme. I am fairly certain I know who the person is (an international student who withdrew from two courses because of language issues and HOMOPHOBIA - she told me she couldn't learn content about LGBTQ people because she doesn't like gay people and hates that she even has to work with lesbians) based upon some of the early statements as well as some terms used (e.g., ""grade requirement"" - a term this student used over and over in my office) and other hints (for instance, they once wrote about their ""mistake"" being taking two courses with me at the same time; further narrows it down). Even if it is not the student I suspect, it is clear that this is one person over and over again. RMP has many issues, including bias and unreliability but its lack of moderation is a huge one. They do not at all filter what is posted on their website and you have to manually flag problematic content to have it looked at (and then, they often do not delete it still). NO ONE will help me because of this guise of anonymity, and so I started an Instagram account to try to highlight some of these issues. We all know this is a space where sexist, racist, homophobic, ableist, fatphobic, transphobic, and generally intolerant comments get posted frequently, in addition to allegations that can be damaging to one's personal or professional identity (despite not being true, in many cases). We also know that students are told to only post one per course but can post 2, 5, 10, 20 times - even in one day, as nothing is tracked (has happened to me and others). It is about time this is highlighted, as the site is (supposedly) not meant to be a space for harassment and defamation. So, anyway, if you know of anyone who has been bullied or targeted on this awful website, please let me know. They have created a culture where people can post about HITLER and then take absolutely no action aside from deleting flagged posts - even though they know this person has come back 55 times. Only a John Doe lawsuit (which I do not have the money for) would identify this person, but given the current amount of hate on college campuses and in society in general, this is obviously upsetting. I'd appreciate any help and promise to delete any identifying info. I very strongly feel students should be made to register using a school account (as they would remain anonymous publicly as long as the account wasn't posted), and that is what I would like to strive for.

"The answer, of course, is ""it depends."" University is a great experience for 18-21 year-olds. It gives them a chance to live independently from their parents, while still being in a supported environment. All of the amenities of the university—libraries, gyms, concerts, lectures, etc.—are at their disposal. They have wonderful opportunities to meet life-long friends. They can perform research alongside professors. And, of course, some courses—e.g. laboratory sciences—just can't be done online. But aside from that, most degrees can be done on-line, and many are indistinguishable from the ""brick-and-mortar"" degrees, from an employer's standpoint. And if course this can save money, if the student lives at home with parents (that said, they might be able to do that with an in-person degree as well, if it's close enough. Some advantages and disadvantages are trade-offs. In an on-line university, you can watch a lecture from the convenience of your own home. But does that mean you're more likely to watch it, or less? For me, I tend to procrastinate, so for on-line classes I save everything to the last minute. But if I have an in-person lecture scheduled, I go to it, because if I don't I've lost my chance.

"Advice for a first generation student who messed up during their teen years. I (19F) need some advice on how the academic world works and what will be expected of me in the long run. A lot of my motivation comes from becoming a first-generation something. It’s the first thing on my mind when I wake up. I spend all my time thinking about my career paths or studying for my exams. I have experienced loss, homelessness, and serious clinical issues since starting my undergrad, and I’m quite worried for my future. I want to do either medicine or neuroscience research (those are the only things that interest me; I would rather die than work in any other field). Both career paths have their advantages and disadvantages, and they will require a lot of time and dedication. My problem is that I am in my 2nd year of my psychology undergrad. I have decent grades, although I’m aiming to graduate at the top of my class by the time I finish. I don’t have the best academic record, and I didn’t know what I wanted to do right after school. But what I do know for sure is that I will be leaving the psychology field entirely—it doesn’t interest me. What will be expected of me? If I get into a good neuroscience program, what will I be doing during graduate studies? If I choose the academic route, what will I need to do after my master’s to be competitive for a PhD program? My writing skills are decent enough, but they’re not stellar. I don’t have talent or outstanding abilities; I’m merely above average.

"Yes, it's a little rude - this is similar to asking if you could just ""not do the graded homework"" or other required aspect of a course. Emailing a professor ""Hey, could I skip the problem sets because I'm not very good at doing them"" would be ridiculous, ditto for asking to skip working in groups because you're not good at it. My answer would be no. *Believe me*, professors hate group work at least as much as the students. If there were any effective way to teach the course learning objectives in my class in a way that didn't require group work, I would jump on it in a heartbeat. Imagine the drama involved in one group project, now multiply by 20 (or however many groups are involved), that's what I get to referee. However, for my course, if I cut out group work, I'd be failing to give students the education they paid for, and I'm not willing to do that. It's rarely the case that group work is assigned *just* because ""it would be too much work for one student"". Sometimes professors say this as an excuse, and sometimes it's also a true statement (on the other hand, sometimes doing the work as one person would be easier, especially if a large part of the work is coordinating with others), but group work exists either explicitly to practice collaboration skills or because the professor doesn't have the bandwidth to grade individual assignments. Saying you ""don't mind doing the extra work"" would be missing the point (I know you, OP, didn't say this, but I've already seen this trope in some of the responses, and it's a common justification that my students offer). ETA: I've found over the years that students have progressively gotten worse at working in groups, because more and more K-12 teachers and professors have given up on making it happen. This is now starting to bleed into professional settings; over the last several years, a large percentage of companies have started refusing to consider hiring folks under the age of 27, citing various 'inability to work with others' factors that have soured them on hiring new grads. This is starting to show up in overall unemployment rates (in 2021, for the first time since this was tracked in the 70s, the unemployment rate for new grads rose above the baseline unemployment rate, and it's stayed that way). Which is to say, learning to work in groups is a *critical* skill, one of the most important that you can learn from your education, and the opportunities to learn it are dwindling - opting out of one of the few remaining chances to get better at this is a bad idea",Faculty,Medium,1.0,web:pullpush:r/AskProfessors:comment:professor rude,Medium,1,2549,455,6,"Yes, it's a little rude - this is similar to asking if you could just ""not do the graded homework"" or other required aspect of a course.",0

"Simultaneous feelings of ""I'm too good for this"" and ""I'm not good enough for this"". (Sorry for weird formatting issues, I'm on mobile) I'm currently a 2nd year PhD student in physics at a top 40-ish (US) school - being vague for the sake of anonymity there, but I wouldn't call it a bad school by any means. However, for my entire post-middle-school education, I'm used to being at the best-tier possible education available to me, and often being one of the highest-performing students within that education. We're talking being at one of the best high schools in the US and doing AP Calc at 15 (and yes, calc isn't important for most people, but is important if you're doing physics), and then getting in to a top-10 university for my field for undergrad. (I just want to give people an idea of where I was coming from - not trying to brag, I promise!) Now, though, I feel like I'm completely flailing. I don't think top 40-ish is bad at all, and, honestly, the profs have, overall, been better teachers than they were at my undergrad, but I still feel like I'm letting everyone around me down, especially my dad (who got his PhD from a top-10 school and was a Hertz fellow). Don't get me wrong - I absolutely didn't deserve to get into the 'better' schools. I had barely any research experience (two summers worth in a completely different subfield, a single publication where I'm nearly-last author out of 60+), and had an incomplete grade that I had to finish later for at least one class every single term. Nothing made me a particularly good applicant, and, considering I knew I wanted to get a PhD by the time I was a third-term sophomore, I was honestly flailing GPA-wise in all of my in-major classes. (I never got below a B-, at least not before I was a senior, but never got above a B+ either). It's not exactly a surprise that I applied to 10+ grad schools and only got into two, one of which is the one I'm currently attending and the other of which is a state school that isn't particularly known for physics. Hell, I barely deserve to be at the school I'm at now, considering I had to take multiple incompletes in classes during 2020-2021 and am only finally starting research this spring/summer when other people in my cohort have been doing research since second term if not earlier [EDIT: this is a COVID thing, I didn't have lab access at all last year since I was living with my parents when we were doing only remote classes - I'm an experimentalist and other experimentalists in my cohort were living in the area if they were doing research]. Objectively speaking, I think I'm probably the worst student within the roughly ~1/3 of the people in my cohort who are also in my subfield, and I would not dare to claim I'm even close to being the smartest out of the entire cohort. On the other hand, I feel like garbage being here instead of a better school. Especially when I'm TAing for premeds who can barely do basic algebra at 22 (and yes, I know the public school system sucks, but they're not fresh out of high school any more, and a lot of them are trying to be *doctors*!). I took a class with mostly first years last term - some of whom are older than me - and I was shocked at how a decent number of them struggled with what I'd consider to be pretty basic algebra. I don't think this makes me better people than them, by any means, but considering I don't even think I'm all that intelligent to begin with, it feels a little bit demoralizing being surrounded by people who are struggling academically when I'm doing pretty much fine. I feel like I threw away all of the opportunities that were handed to me on a silver platter, especially with the level of my undergrad in my field. Nearly everyone who was in physics in my year ended up at grad school at a top 10, if not a top 5 (if they went to grad school, anyway), and every time I'm reminded of that fact I feel like I've thrown even more of my opportunities away, especially my research opportunities here. Anyway. If you read through this entire post, you're a trooper. It's just a weird simultaneous feeling of being a fish out of water and also feeling way too (book! I must stress, ONLY book!) smart for the majority of the people that you're around who aren't in your cohort, and I wanted to know if anyone else related to it, because there's no way in hell I'm talking about this with anyone *in* my cohort.

"Regretting my college experience. I (20F) feel like I’ve wasted my college years and am now having serious regrets. For some context, I attend a T20 university that is known as one of the more rigorous/ intense schools. When I got in during my senior year of college, I was of course ecstatic. I was aware that the school would be “hard”, but I was not aware of just how much this would extend past academics. I always imagined myself attending a university that has a good blend of great academics AND a more traditional college environment (think Duke, UVA, UCLA, although I only applied to one of these schools), and had prepared myself for going to tailgates, supporting my school’s sports teams, and having an enjoyable social life. Unfortunately, I am now a junior, and I have done none of these things. Not because I don’t want to, but because there just aren’t many opportunities to. Most students at my school couldn’t care less about anything related to the college experience, many more concerned about grinding on assignments, especially on weekends. I have no issue with how people choose to spend their time — issue is, I’ve adopted this same mentality and have begun to burnout. I wish I had more options to take my mind off school every once in a while, but aside from my school only having D3 sports no one supports and no one really caring about Greek life (myself included), I’ve found that my school just isn’t the environment I envisioned myself in. To make things worse, I’ve found that it has been incredibly hard to meet people, whether in a romantic context, or even just as friends. People are either too busy to maintain friendly relationships or we just don’t have much in common, and as a result, befriending people is almost impossible. When I reflect on my time in college up to this point, I have very few fond memories of doing typical college things, and instead these memories are saddled with times when I’ve stressed trying to make a deadline or sitting alone in the library studying. My biggest regret is the fact that once I graduate, it’ll be even harder to meet people in my age group and this is supposed to be the main time of my life where I should be forming long lasting friendships, gathering my future bridesmaids, and getting into a relationship (whether it lasts past college or not). I understand that I’m exaggerating quite a bit and things will likely be fine in the end, but it’s really hard to have a positive outlook when my high school friends at my flagship university are having the time of their lives while I’m becoming more and more miserable everyday I spend here",Library,High,2.0,reddit:r/college,High,2,2626,466,13,Regretting my college experience.,0

"State of the Subreddit 2016. Greetings from Andorra! The moderation team and I want to address our community. Steve_nyc and I have been hands-off this summer, but we monitor and communicate regularly about the direction of the subreddit. I have been traveling, and he is working on a book about college essays. Now that the application season is gearing up, we have a few exciting announcements along with introducing new moderators! **What is /r/applyingtocollege?** We are a community for discussion of undergraduate admissions with a focus on American universities. We have grown significantly in the two years since /u/steve_nyc created /r/applyingtocollege as an alternative to what he saw as sometimes unproductive college admissions forums. Steve runs the college admissions podcast www.collegeadmissionstoolbox.com and also has extensive experience with law school admissions and LSAT prep. Some of our users have been featured on his podcast! He currently helps students craft beautiful college admissions essays. He has over a decade of higher education experience. My name is Kevin Martin, and I joined the community in October of 2015. I am a former admissions counselor for UT-Austin. I help students apply to college through www.texadmissions.com, and I have a Youtube channel offering advice: www.youtube.com/c/utadmissionsguy As other internet forums exceeded in membership in the hundreds of thousands, quality decreased. I am personally pleased to see many of our members putting forward original, thought-provoking content offering advice and perspectives with nuance. We moderate our community perhaps more than the average subreddit; there is no place here for put-downs and unconstructive criticism. We recognize that this is probably the most stressful time in your lives up until this point, and I and the other moderators work towards “keeping the peace” and maintaining standards of decency. **How did we get here?** What started as one subreddit has spawned into more addressing the needs and requests of our members. * /r/chanceme – a community where you can present your admissions profile and list of schools where members assess your chances of gaining admission * /r/collegeessayreview – a platform to share your essays and receive feedback * /r/collegeresults – important in March and April when students put forward their “chanceme” profiles and let us know how things turned out. It functions as a database for future applicants. **If your post deals with essay reviews or asking what your chances are, please post them in the relevant subreddits. We are beginning to remove threads posted in the incorrect place.** In two years, we are pleased to see how the community has grown to over 6,000 members! You can view our traffic [stats here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/about/traffic/). Naturally, the busiest time of the year is March and April when decisions are released and September – November when students are beginning and finalizing their applications. Since we are adding on average 20 subscribers per day, the moderation demands became too large for Steve and I. During the past few months; we have reached out to a few quality contributors. **Who is joining the moderation team? Introducing our new moderators!** Steve and I are pleased and excited to announce the addition of three new moderators. * /u/ask_admissions – a higher education professional with extensive experience working for a medium-sized public university in the state of Texas. She brings years of college admissions and student development experience and is a wealth of knowledge when it comes to addressing questions and concerns. She recently transitioned to a role in medical school admissions in Arkansas. She will be the primary point of contact for setting up and maintaining future AMAs. * /u/tylersunami – you may recall many quality responses and original content she has put forward. She is an absolutely brilliant and gifted writer, and we are excited to bring her on board to offer perspectives on most selective admissions. She approaches not just college admissions, but her life with a balance – and sanity – that is often absent in the high-stakes world of college admissions. From Las Vegas, she will be enrolling as a Freshman at Stanford in the fall. * /u/inherentdestroyer – he has done an excellent job providing thoughtful responses to a whole range of frequently asked and sometimes sensitive questions that our members have. He will help organize content and enforce the standards and expectations for maintaining the quality of our community. He will enroll soon at Boston College in the fall as a biochemistry major and Spanish minor. **Where are we going?** Twice monthly, we fielded questions and concerns on how to improve the subreddit. For the past few months, I combed through every single thread and made a list of recommendations. The moderation team and I have been busy reviewing concerns our members have and what we can do to improve it. Here is our list of action steps moving forward: • *AMAs* – this was probably our single biggest request – student and professional perspectives on college admissions. Steve did an outstanding job in the early days of the subreddit organizing, preparing, and putting forward many great AMAs. [You can view them here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/3erfrt/reddit_applying_to_college_amas/) It is a ton of work to coordinate and communicate with interviewees who are giving their time to us. It also takes effort to train people who may be unfamiliar with the Reddit style. We are excited to announce that we already have a few AMAs coming up. If you are a college student or higher education professional interested in conducting an AMA, please contact /u/ask_admissions. There is a vetting process to collaborate on ways to most effectively serve the needs of our members. • *FAQ* – we are working on a wiki-style frequently asked questions. Tired of seeing the same topics about SAT II subject tests and recommendation letters? We are aiming at putting these all in one place. • *Subreddit Collaboration* – There are a lot of communities relevant to college admissions like /r/teenagers, /r/education, /r/highereducation, and /r/college. I did an AMA on /r/teenagers last year, and it went really well. We are looking to build on these relationships and find ways to organize and share our efforts. There are also a ton of college-specific subreddits that get flooded with admissions questions. We will work on getting the word out so those inquiries can be directed here. • *Flairs* – we will introduce a new flair system. Currently, your choices are high school, college student, or admissions professional. This should especially help our current college students and admissions personnel identify which institutions they attend or represent. • *Layout* – we are working on updating and modernizing the layout and sidebar. • *Recurring threads* – do you like to rant, but don’t have a nice place to put it? What about spreading the love about a lesser known institution or university? Is there a particularly popular major that students have questions about? We are developing regularly occurring threads a la “Fresh Question Fridays,” “Transfer Tuesdays,” or “Rant Wednesdays” that are popular in other subreddits like /r/fitness. **What can YOU do?** **Our vision is to be the premier online destination for college admissions conversations.** And we cannot do this alone. Our subreddit can only be as strong as the collective efforts of our community. Putting forward original content, linking towards thoughtful discussions and informative resources, and providing constructive feedback in comments are all ways you can help out. One of the biggest complaints we receive is that this subreddit is too focused on top-20/most-selective/HPYS. My theory – the students most likely to independently seek out college admissions advice are also those also more likely to seek admission to the most sought after schools. Should this be the case? It doesn’t matter, frankly, because it is the reality that college forums tend towards interest in schools with the most applicants and the least available spaces. We cannot control the demographics of the subreddit, but only respond to the needs of our collective members. The anxiety and neuroses that surround this process frustrates everyone – students, parents, teachers, counselors, admissions counselors. None of us like how stressful this process is, and it makes me really, really thankful that I’m not an 18-year-old applying to American universities. It is up to you to do your part in decreasing this stress. Lamenting lack of resources for veterans or exposure for lesser known private universities? Do you see a need for transfer resources? Are there parents who come here from time to time and may not receive the attention they deserve? Think the subreddit format stinks? **Do something about it!** We invite any users with ideas on how to improve this subreddit contribute their time and energy. If you are interested in helping out with the labor-intensive process of reformatting the layout, organizing and contributing to the wiki and FAQ and identifying high-quality posts worth preserving, or have ideas on how to assign flair, please get in touch! We cannot do this alone, and we welcome your contributions. If you have any suggestions, please use this stickied thread to let us know. We try our best to respond to the needs of our users and we take both complaints and compliments seriously. **As always, please report comments that would be more appropriate in another subreddit, break rules, and etiquette. We have also noticed an uptick in spam. If you see repeated violators, please send us a message directly to myself or the modmail.** I hope that this finds you well on the eve of another college admissions cycle! - The Moderation Team",Attendance,Medium,1.0,web:pullpush:r/ApplyingToCollege:submission:complaint,Medium,1,9942,1578,2,State of the Subreddit 2016.,0

"How do I make friends at a commuter university. Hello everyone, I currently attend a university in the city where I was born and raised and live at home (first year). Growing up I was never “popular” but I always had friends. Looking back though, I never really had a set group of friends till about grade 7. I have a lot of acquaintances and friends but I don’t really text or hangout with them often. I have two close friends, we text and hangout fairly often, while I’m happy for them as their social transition into university had been really great, I feel so socially stunted. I met people in my classes and help each other with school work and joke around, but I would really consider them my “friends”. We don’t hangout or text outside of class. My close friends are in the faculty of science, so naturally making friends comes much easier due to the need collaboration. I on the other am a political science major, so the classes first year are very isolating as people basically come to lecture and head straight home, at my university there is campus culture at all (except for the people who live on campus of course). It seems that everyone has their established friend groups, I know there are others feeling lonely like me (I see them complaining on Reddit) but I never actually cross paths with them. I won’t lie also that I haven’t joined any clubs, but I have morning classes and most clubs are at 6pm at night, I don’t want to stay on campus that long. Another issue I face is that I don’t drink or party so it’s difficult to be find people who also don’t do that stuff. It’s embarrassing I have to come to Reddit but I want to make a change and make real legitimate friends. I try to be friendly and have good hygiene and smile but nothing seems to work. I feel especially as a girl, loneliness is way worse. This semester is nearly done, but I have a Spring class in May and June twice a week so I’m hoping maybe I can meet some new people there. I also signed up for the media project during the Spring so I hope that will help also. Does any have any pro life tips?

"Feeling Unfairly Treated and Completely Discouraged by Faculty — Has Anyone Else Experienced This in Dental School. Hi everyone, I’m a D2 dental student, and I’m genuinely struggling with how I’ve been treated by faculty at my school. I’ve reached a point where I’m questioning if I even want to become a dentist anymore, which is really heartbreaking for me to admit because I’ve worked so hard to get here. Lately, I’ve been noticing what feels like consistent unfair treatment — not just in grading, but in how I’m spoken to and treated during lab and class. Recently, I found out my practical grading might not have been blind since faculty come directly to our seats and know where we sit. Somehow, my typodont and grade were switched, and it just feels way too coincidental. On top of that, I’ve had multiple situations where I was dismissed or outright ignored when I tried to ask for help. For example, I once finished a project early in sim lab and waited until almost the end of class to ask my professor for feedback. Instead of giving me any guidance, she brushed me off and said I “should’ve listened in class.” Meanwhile, I constantly see her going above and beyond to help other students — giving them drawings, tips, and detailed explanations. Another time, an adjunct faculty member straight-up lied to my face and told me she wasn’t assigned to my row when I asked for help. Then moments later, she was back at my row helping a line of students. When I politely asked why she told me otherwise, she gave me attitude and said she couldn’t help me until I “fixed something” she had already signed off on the week before. It’s honestly breaking me down. I’ve cried multiple times because of how discouraging and demoralizing this environment feels. The faculty don’t even give constructive critiques — they just tell us our work is bad without explaining why or how to improve. When I ask for specifics, they can’t even point out what’s actually wrong. It feels less like teaching and more like being constantly torn down. To make things worse, I’m the only Black woman in my entire class of 130. I can’t help but feel that’s part of why I’m being treated differently, even if no one will ever say it out loud. It’s isolating and exhausting trying to show up every day and still give my all while feeling targeted or overlooked. I don’t want to make assumptions or overreact, but I also can’t keep pretending it’s fine. I feel bullied and attacked by people who are supposed to be mentors and educators. Has anyone else gone through something like this? How did you handle it — especially when you’re scared of retaliation or being labeled “difficult”?

"Am I cooked already? (Freshman with bad grade in two classes, not sure whether to stick to the bachelors level or not). I saw Oppenheimer last year and stupidly thought I would be a super scientist when I've never been cut out for it, so I majored in Physics, got into a trig and physics class, and immediately bottomed out of both. I'm at a sub-60 in both classes right now. I've since pivoted to a Philosophy Theology double major, but I wanna know if I should even plan on going for a PHD or not because I heard even 1-2 bad grades can lock you out of the top schools. I really like both subjects and have always been a lot stronger with language than math, but I don't wanna spend 4 years and hit a ceiling where I can't get a doctorate in a doctorate-centric field. Now, my school does a cool thing where they'll replace your lowest test grade with your final exam, and if I do REALLY well from here on out I can still pull like an 84-87 in both classes, but I can't withdraw from either due to my scholarship requirements. I heard Philosophy programs in particular is a pain to get into, and I have a very narrow type of Philosophy I'm interested in (Philosophy of Religion, particularly concerning the descriptions and ethical nature of Heaven and Hell, per the scripture) and a lot of the others don't seem very interesting, I'm a pretty good writer, or so I've been told, so I'm not as concerned about the writing sample. I'm also not very concerned with the GRE as I got an OKAY-ish score (1200-1300, I believe?) on the SAT without studying and that was with me absolutely bombing the math section once again (a problem of mine, I know) I just want to make sure I'm set to continue, I currently am on the deans list with a 3.8 from dual credit, coming out of a 4.6 in High School and I have As in the rest of my classes. I'm currently at a community college and my Physics professor has a crazy accent but I am PLANNING on transferring to Clemson soon, or Duke if I win the lottery and can pay their out-of-state tuition. College, in general, has been a big change from me barely trying in High School, so that's really the issue here, It's not so much that the content is exceedingly hard, I do fine on the labs and whatnot, but I just don't know HOW to study at all, and as a result of having both ADHD and ASD I have a really hard time just sitting down and reading 80 pages of a textbook, I've also noticed that the professors seem to have a taste for highlighting 5 or so sections for the test and making 80% of the questions on the last 2 sections, which makes me particularly ticked off.

"What do you do if a professor seems intent on failing students and unwilling to aid or change grades. Hello, Can someone give me some advice on what to do about this professor? This professor has high credentials in our program, so I'm a little concerned. It is not just me who believes she grades unfairly, it's several other students as well. It does not help that one of the students (male student as I and he are the only males in the program) made a rude comment and her, the professor, overheard and possibly thought it was me. Vague examples: I will answer a question and she will mark it incorrect even though it is indeed correct, she claims it is not what she's looking for. She has no grading rubric so the points seem arbitrary. She overlooks questions in emails. She's very rude and hostile on the phone. She gets snippy and rolls her eyes if a student politely corrects her on a transcription. I will answer a question correctly and add one part subjectively incorrect and she will not even award full credit. For example, if she were to ask ""what color is the sky?"" And I would say ""baby blue and dark blue"" she'd say ""you're wrong it's only baby blue. 0 points!"" I actually references this issue to a person I know from another department who has studied linguistics for years and he, too, admits that this professor is unjust and harsh. She encourages students to email or call her if we have questions about assignment but when I do she says she can't help me at all because it would be unethical. We have online exams and the exams were very long with lots of writing and phonetic transcribing involved (linguistics). A lot of copying and pasting phonemes. She does not provide appropriate enough time for the exams and there are many glitches which she will not address. She told another student (male) that if there was an error on the test or glitch that cause an answer choice to be left out or anything of that matter, she will not do anything because she admits she will never change anyone's grades. She said curving exams are for undergrads. It just frustrates me because it doesn't have to be this way! I was under the impression that instructors at the graduate level are NOT out to fail you, but guide you. I have received no guidance whatsoever. My past professors were incredible. I'm encouraged by others to simply go through this course and ignore these mistakes, but I think I am failing (went from a 96 to a 80 because of one project and I cannot earn lower than an 80% and I'm at 80.) I've already had a back-and-forth with her about a quiz. She claims a letter I wrote was wrong because it didn't look like the phoneme she wanted, when if you look at how I typically write that phonemes for reference, it was the correct. She's extremely harsh on papers and again the rubric appears to be quite arbitrary. It's even more frustrating because my former linguistics supervisor disagrees. What was the straw that broke the camel's back was the way she spoke to me on the phone. I was polite as possible, but I asked her ""What can I do to improve my grade? Can I redo the answer you said I accidentally left out in the project, since I clearly know the answer and it was a simple mistake."" She says ""That would be unfair to the students and frankly you're putting me in an uncomfortable position."" Excuse me, but: Wat. Frankly, this whole situation makes me uncomfortable. Never in my academic career as a student from age 3 to 30 (I am aged 30) have I felt the need to write this about a professor. It's good to know I'm not alone according to my classmates. What should I do from here? What would *you* do? Crossing my fingers and hoping I don't sound whiny. I am typically a B student so I am no way a perfectionist. I've never experienced this before.

"Questioning My Reality After Faculty Email Exchange. I don't know what I'm looking for here--maybe just a rant, but maybe a check-in to see if your campuses fit this same pattern? A couple days ago, a professor on the Academic Integrity committee sent out a reminder on our procedures to all faculty that went over where the handbook links are, how to explain academic dishonesty in your syllabus, how to have a conversation about it, and how to report it. I thought it was great, because those things can feel overwhelming, and it's not talked about much in our day-to-day (because honestly, it's about the least favorite part of any of our jobs). They closed with something that stunned me: there were only 40ish reports submitted to academic integrity in *all* of last year, and they revealed this has been pretty normal for years (hell, I can verify that I alone account for several of those), and that this could be an issue because it falls far below what the predicted average of a community college our size would be. That was surprising, but I still found the email helpful, and made me feel like I wasn't alone for once. HOWEVER, then the reply-all's came. The first one was appreciative and made a somewhat snarky remark about how we don't value education in this country anymore. Fair enough I guess, but a little more suited for a forum like this than an email exchange IMO. But then another faculty member chimed in with what I can only describe as a discouragement against submitting academic reports. They hit all the usual marks: ""I hope you will aim to be *nurturing* rather than *punishing*,"" ""students do this out of desperation,"" and the real kicker, ""remember that even one report will go on their permanent academic record, which will be looked at by sports teams, nursing programs, professional schools, etc."" And I'm sitting here like. *good*? Those organizations should be made aware when people are cheating. The whole reason we have an academic integrity *board* is so that an unfair judgment isn't made by a single person, right? In all this talk of compassion, what about (1) compassion for the majority of students who *do not cheat* and want their experience to be fair and their degrees to be valued, and (2) compassion for all the people--clients, employers, employees, patients, etc--the cheating students will later interact with. Do I really want a nurse who uncritically dispenses all medication because a machine told him to? Do I want an auto mechanic who installs shoddy brake pads because she ""panicked"" and ""ran out of time""? Do I want an insurance agent who cuts corners and fails to account for little details because they've always been passed along and never faced consequences? At the very least, reporting is important to see if this truly was a one-off for a student because they were desperate, or whether this is a pattern. I felt incredibly disheartened by the pushback against reporting, especially when four other faculty also hit reply all and seemed to back up the person discouraging reporting. I feel--based on my own experiences, but also reading the experiences of people here--like cheating and fraud have gotten worse in recent years because of the prevalence of generative AI. It is honestly killing my passion for the work. I dread grading essays and discussions in my online courses because there is so much slop. So to see other faculty suggest I'm mean or overly punitive for trying to hold students to a standard kicked off another depressive cycle for me. I'm supposed to be completing a tenure track job app and doing a self-reflection for my evaluation, and I've completely lost all motivation. Am I crazy here? Do you feel other faculty or the admin at your college have your back when it comes to trying to hold the line on academic misconduct?

"Financially, it is feasible. And, I have definitely thought about leaving, but, probably not for the reasons most people would state. I actually don't mind the teaching. The student in my department are pretty good. And, I'm in a field where rampant cheating using LLMs/AI isn't possible (at least, not on in-person exams). And, my service and teaching loads are light. But, I'm actually tired of the research. I just find the process of writing papers for academic journals to be boring. And, as research is really most of my job, that is what has caused me to contemplate leaving. What keeps me around (so far) are (i) I like the energy of being on a college campus, (ii) hard to give up my salary and healthcare, given I do relatively little work for them, and (iii) I don't have a solid plan for what else I would do with my life if I retired. I mean, I have activities that I enjoy outside of work. But, I can't do those activities all day, every day. So, for the moment, I am kind of searching for alternative things to do with my life. And, if an opportunity arises, I will probably leave academia. What's rather ironic is that, part of the reason I wanted to go into academia was the allure of having a secure tenured position. And, now that I have it, I really don't care about it. Probably being financially secure is the reason.

"I'm going through a Title IX issue with an EX. Should I do formal or informal resolution. I'm the girl who posted awhile back, for context. You don't really need context, but. Anyway, months later and the school has decided that they are not going to charge him with sexual assault because they can't find ""suffucicent evidence"" that it was nonconsensual. That hurts like you can't imagine but I need to keep my eye on the ball now. They are going to charge him with retalation for telling one of my professors that I carried a gun on campus after I first went to Title IX to get a no contact order for harassment (I don't, lol) and for sexual harassment for distributing a comic about our relationship to class that included a panel of me and him kissing (labeled by my name) and then several panels after that of a girl that looks just like me being raped and killed by a man who looks just like him. I have an option to just like the head of the TITLE IX office to decide if he did wrong and give out a punishment (informal) or go through a formal process where three adminstrators will sit down, listen to the investigator present the evidnce, and make a choice. I don't know what to do. Informal gives a lot of power to one person and I don't know if she is on my side or not, tbh. I mean I can't know. But the formal process will have three people I've never met before listen to the story and they can decide, at that point, if he did anything wrong or if it's a big deal or not. And it's unclear to me if I can mention the fact I was sexually assaulted by him, I don't think I can which is fucking insane because that's why I left the relationship in the first place. Advice.

"Visiting/International Masters Projects (UK) - why. Genuinely confused. MSc students, often from the continent, emailing to ask if they can do their MSc research in my lab (not ERASMUS scheme).

"I have 9 months to finish my entire PhD dissertation and I haven't written a thing in 4 years.yet I am optimistic. *Fair warning, this is a bit of a story. TL;DR will be at the bottom.* I'm not really asking anything here, just sharing my tale. I'm going to do my best to finish this PhD but just need to share this story so I can figure out for myself what happened over the past 4 years. &amp;#x200B; **It begins.** My PhD is in History and it has been tumultuous to say the least. After 4 years of Life throwing it's little adventures at me I am now in my final year and have yet to write anything down. Though, I have been doing what research I could and feel that if I just put my ass in my seat and knock it out, I'll get it done in time. \*cautiously optimistic\* (I base that on my track record of always pulling my work out of the fire at the last second and that I've never failed any course before, and in fact usually have pretty decent marks. but, I've also never had to write 80,000+ words before.) I started my PhD in 2014 and fully intended to complete it in 3 years. I spent my first year working as a tutor whilst putting together my proposal and, thankfully, it was accepted. My second year didn't start off so well as my funding dried up and I had to get a full-time job to cover this. I though that I would still keep my PhD full-time and just work on it in between work. what a fool I was. &amp;#x200B; **The Museum** The job I managed to get was working at a museum. ""Hooray!"" I thought, ""This will be the perfect opportunity to work in the area I want whilst also completing my studies!"" but the museum didn't want me to work in their social sciences or military history sections, as I had applied for, they wanted me to work in their marketing department as an events manager. Not a problem, I had marketing and eventing experience from a previous job, this should be fine, a job is a job. It wasn't fine. What followed was 2 years of torture. The museum group had 11 museums under its auspice and is government owned and managed. Some would think a cushy government job, right? Unfortunately, far from the truth. Understaffed and overworked with remarkably unhelpful coworkers (barring 3 or 4 who kept me sane during my time there) I was expected to manage the weekly events for 11 different museums and regularly started work at 5am and ended at 1am to cater for events. I was ONE MAN managing all these spaces. My request for extra help or even just to borrow the dept intern to answer some of my emails fell on deaf ears. And my boss was an ageing widower who frequently made me drop everything to accommodate her latest crush who just HAD TO have his party in the gallery but first he wants to walk around the space for three hours umm'ing and aww'ing with me in tow. Needless to say, there is a lot more to this whole story, but bottom line I was unable to work on my PhD at all, barring ONE research trip to some archives I needed to visit, which cost me 2 weeks of backed up event work. I intended to eventually quit so I could go back to my studies, I just wanted to get 2 years of solid work experience on my CV first. My academic supervisor was supportive but mostly absent during this whole process apart from the occasional emails and meetings. &amp;#x200B; **The Wedding** Half way through 2016 (1 and a half years into working at the museum) my parent's health took a turn for the worst and that required me to visit when I could to help out. And then, IT happened. My sister was getting married, so I took a few days off to attend the wedding, a nice welcomed break from work, and to help the family out with prepping and running everything. I was to do one of the toasts and to help with the catering and other organising. Well, even though my sister was bridezilla, the wedding went really well and the reception was a blast. up until the marriage ended 4 hours after it had begun. To this day we're not exactly sure what happened, some kind of massive argument behind closed doors that lead to the marriage being dissolved soon after. To be fair, there had been cracks and warning signs for the duration of the relationship, but we didn't expect it to explode the way it did not even a few hours after the actual ceremony. So, I had to request an extra few days from work to handle the fallout, and eventually this would lead to me quitting my job at the museum so I could focus on keeping my family together and getting them through this. &amp;#x200B; **The Rehab** I spent another month at the museum finishing up a variety of projects before heading overseas to help my family out in the least few months of 2016. My sister had gone catatonic, due to what would later be diagnosed as PTSD from the events at the wedding, and was quite literally killing my folks (who were still suffering from ill health) so I had to take charge. (I should mention that they were overseas as my folks were in the process of immigrating when all this happened so they took my sister for some R&amp;R but couldn't handle her fallout. I had some psychology training so I could help a bit.) This is called the rehab phase not just because I would spend almost all of 2017 helping my sister and parents recover, but also myself. You see, I had some bad injuries from a car accident back in 2006 in my hip, spine and shoulder that I had done well to recover from over the years, but the sheer stress from the job I had taken had ruined all of that progress. The sitting at the desk 9+ hours a day, the 2-4 hour daily commute, and the overall stress had caused my body to seize in places and I had gained a ton of weight. All of that just wrecked my health and I spent most of 2017 going to rehab and helping my parents recover from health issues and my sister come out of her shell again. My academic supervisor was aware of most of this, but for the most part I was a ghost in the department. Three years into the PhD and people at the department had no clue who I was when I would pop by for meetings. And to top 2017 off, I ended up having to take my brother in for rehab because he had fallen into a bad cocaine habit and had lost his business as a result. My father's health also took a sharp dip and all around it was a very dark time for my family. &amp;#x200B; **A New Dawn** If I sound bitter through any of this, I must admit that I was for a long while. I was very angry and I STILL had not done any real work on my PhD by this point. Luckily, things began to look up at the start of 2018. All this while, I had used up most of my meagre savings from my museum job, but luckily I managed to find a semi-decent ESL job which I could do online and from home. I also got a part-time gig submitting articles to a magazine so money wasn't really an issue for a while, but it also meant less time for studies. I had also managed to get a small bursary grant for my studies which were enough to cover my tuition fees and a research trip (which I took last September and did some magnificent research if I do say so myself!). My brother got out of rehab in January and the family rallied to get him back on his feet. He had a set back or two, but he's been clean 5 months now. My sister is out of her shell as well and I got her a job teaching English at the same company I work at, so she's doing much better for herself. And, I'm happy to say, my parent's health is vastly improved, though they have had to sell their home overseas and move back due to work commitments but at least they have their health! For my part, I started losing weight (23kgs so far, only 7 away from my ideal weight!) and I'm also back to running and boxing, which I love and haven't done for years. As for research, last year I managed to do a lot more research than I ever had before, and I made a name for myself in my department (though for work unrelated to my PhD) by being hardworking and dependable. I started spending time in the post-grad room often, making friends and re-introducing myself to the staff there. My supervisor even had me to teach a class of his for a semester (though that ended up taking 2 months of my time as it was a month of teaching and then a month of marking! Sigh.) which turned out to be one of the most popular classes of the year! The students loved it from what they told me, so that made me feel really good. And to top 2018 off, in a good way, I managed to receive a second iteration of my bursary, so my fees and research trip for 2019 will be covered again. The documents I found last year will also blow my research wide open, for which I am very excited! Just need the military to declassify some and we're golden. &amp;#x200B; **Twenty Nineteen** And that brings us to now. This year I HAVE to finish my PhD and I have yet to start writing. I am more than a little nervous, I won't lie, but I also know I'm a prolific writer once I get going and I know this subject well. I have to hand the dissertation in in October and am presenting what I have done so far in a conference in June. So far, my supervisor has been super supportive but he hasn't seen a single piece of my actual writing, though I have filled him in on what I've uncovered so far. He seems optimistic that my research will be good, but he doesn't know I haven't actually put pen to paper yet. so to speak. But I'll have something good for the conference I'm sure. (Oh, did I mention my supervisor retired at the start of this year? This is sort of a good thing because it means he'll have more time for me!) I still have to earn a living, so half my month will be spent teaching ESL so I can have enough money to get by, and the final half will be spent at the dept writing my arse off. I've written out a schedule of what I need to be writing when and how many pages I need to complete per day, week, and month to meet my deadline. It is going to be brutal, and gruelling, but I think I can do it. I have to. &amp;#x200B; **Thanks for reading!** So, yeah, I think I just needed to vent and reading through the threads here, many of you seem very kind and experienced. Not sure if anyone else has ever been in a similar position and managed to pull off any miracles, but if so, I would love to hear about it. Or if anyone has any advice on ways to make my writing go smoother, that will also be appreciated. I will definitely report back here after all is said and done to put an end, one way or another, to my sordid tale but I think it will be a good ending. &amp;#x200B; &gt;*TL;DR* &gt; &gt;a variety of things happened over the past 4 years which meant I didn't have any time to do any research or writing. From being overworked at a museum, to my family imploding (including a botched wedding, a sibling in rehab, and the ailing health of myself and my parents), to finding the time between work to write something. Through it all, I'm still optimistic I'll get this done. &amp;#x200B;",Attendance,High,2.0,web:reddit:r/gradschool:search:attendance issue,High,2,10910,2110,2,I have 9 months to finish my entire PhD dissertation and I haven't written a thing in 4 years.yet I am optimistic.,0

"How to improve exam security. I am trying to tighten up exam security and would like to ask for advice or perspectives. I realize that I cannot stop all instances of academic dishonesty, and I try to avoid obsessing over it. Rather, I try to develop efficient systems that 1. prevents as much as reasonably possible, and 2. that are very visible to students such that it signals I take this seriously and can and will dig deeper into suspicious activity, and is therefore a deterrent, and/or 3. makes cheating more difficult or time consuming and will therefore negatively impact grade. I’m especially looking for strategies that require little effort from me, eg, set up once and then it runs on autopilot or close to it. Here’s the situation. 120 students complete a 25 question multiple choice exam, via Canvas, in person, in an auditorium. Single cheat sheet allowed. Three exams per semester. I teach this every semester. No TA available for proctoring. I’m wary of messing around with scantron, I’m aware of the benefits, but let’s put scantron to the side. I’ve been reading about Gradescope/Zipgrade/open-mcr, and am hoping for reasonable solutions that allow me to stick with exams via Canvas. Here are the most common current problems that I am aware of, and what I’ve done about it or have considered. Problem: Students send the password to the exam to friends outside of room. To combat this, 1. All personal effects (esp phones, put into bags), other than their device and single cheatsheet, against the side wall. 2. One short answer question, must enter word projected at front of room, shown only after about 10 minutes have passed. 3. Respondus Lockdown Browser. 4. I have shortened the amount of time to complete exam (from 60 min to 30 min, for 25 MC Qs). 5. I do roll call after there are only 10-15 students left in the room, calling out names of people that Canvas indicates are still working on the exam (shown on “moderate this quiz”). This has caught quite a few cheaters, possibly because the reason they’re out of the room is that they have to look up answers, which is likely time-consuming. But this relies on Canvas logs, which is sketchy and not bulletproof evidence, and not all students will know that I do this, so it probably lacks a widespread deterrent effect. The above strategies take little/no effort on my part, and are probably somewhat deterrent. However, there is likely opportunity to message these passwords from messaging app on laptop, either before or after entering LockDown. Problem: Students leave room without submitting exam, and work on it elsewhere with unauthorized resources. This is the problem I am most struggling with. Obviously Lockdown Browser doesn’t help with this. So far, to combat this, 1. I have shortened the amount of time to complete exam (from 60 min to 30 min, for 25 MC Qs). Other than that: I have tried having them sign out, after finishing exam, on printed rosters, but there is a flood of students done the exam after 10-15 min, and there was a huge line up to sign out. I could try to split up the signout sheets by names A-G, H-K, etc, but there’d still be a lot of commotion, while other students are trying to concentrate, and might need to talk to me about something. I have considered requiring students show me their “quiz submitted X minutes ago” page before leaving the room, but this would probably be chaotic, distracting for others, and prevents me from stalking around the room watching things. Our IT dept has warned against restricting IP addresses. I don’t know enough about this that I feel comfortable experimenting with it. Plus, not sure it’d stop someone from leaving room and hiding out in nearby bathroom stall, etc. I’ve considered requiring that they hand in their cheat sheets. But this lacks a log of time they left the room; plus, potentially too much commotion while others are working. Any other ideas?

"Grad school in Argentina versus USA - thoughts/experiences. Hey everyone, So a little background about me: I'm a 24 year old American and am considering going back to school. My undergraduate degree is in Spanish &amp; International Affairs with a concentration in Latin America. I've studied abroad in Chile and spent two years living in Colombia and teaching English after graduation. Now I'm a freelance writer but I want to go back to school and get back into my field. The issue is I'm having trouble deciding which program is the better choice. My first choice is to attend school in Buenos Aires, where I would study for a Master's in either IR or Human Rights. The program is 15 months and significantly cheaper than the U.S. (like max $5,000 per year for tuition). I would be able to just work part-time while going to school and wouldn't have to take out any more loans. However, I'm a little nervous that my degree won't carry a lot of weight in the U.S. My second choice is a dual-degree program for a J.D. and a Master's in International Relations, which would provide a good base for a career in human rights law (something I've been leaning towards). However, the program is $40,000 and in Boston (which is quite expensive). I really don't want to take out loans, but I feel that this degree might be more valuable. Does anyone have any experience with getting a Master's degree abroad (specifically in Latin America would be great)? Did you find that you had trouble getting work? Do you think that a degree abroad combined with relevant internships could be just as valuable as a degree from the U.S? Basically any thoughts, opinions, stories, and experiences are welcome!

Hope I at least provided some entertainment with my rant. Good luck with all of your academic and professional endeavours whether you are 20 or 80 years old. T (PS - I think it's very amusing that so many assume I'm a man!) _____ Just need to rant… At my (relatively prestigious) school, they decided a decade or so ago that since more students are going straight to grad school, every master’s student need a compulsory “preparing for real working life” course. I won’t go into details, but you basically do some kind of practical work experience solo or in a team, have a presentation and then write a report based on what I have found is quite … sketchy literature. I think the main textbook is written by the dude who is in charge of the course. The credit load is 1/4 of a full time term. So hardly a huge course. So….

I’ve been employed in the private and public sector, in small and large institutions, and I even successfully ran my own company for a few years. The “practical” assignment plus paper is similar to what I do several times in a given week. Like, my actual job? I do shit and then evaluate and report? It’s what professional employees DO! I applied to be exempted from this course for OBVIOUS reasons. I wrote a ridiculous, detailed letter, provided a ton of examples of my work, and included reference letters from all my current and previous managers, and of course attached my resume.

Anyway, I kind got a answer from the financial aid director. His explanation was that I'm a ""part-time student"" and they had to return the loan money due to my eligibility. The loan money was already used to pay for the class. So what did they do with the $6 grand the government sent them? I been talking to one of my family relatives who teach in that area. She recommended I file a petition to their billing office. I also submit a complaint with FASFA and hope they be willing to work out a solution with me. There's no way I'm going pay thousands of dollars for a class that uses YouTube for their lesson. This also may affect my decision on whether or not I want continue my education going forward.

"Really odd situation with professor - should I ask for a letter of recommendation now. I had an odd situation happen with a professor. 4 months ago I asked him to write and submit a letter for an internship I applied for. He sent me a copy of the letter (I didn't ask to see it) and I noticed that the file was named with a different student's name. I politely asked him if he would mind changing it to my name. He responded like this ""Does it make any difference how the file is named? Does it impede your application? You are the FIRST student who has ever commented about the file name."" So I told him that it's okay the letter can be sent as it is, and he sent it in. This occured 4 months ago, I did not recieve that internship although one of the hiring managers there did tell me that my ""application and letters are very strong"". I am now applying for post-bacc research jobs, and I want to ask this professor to submit the letter for me for a job I am currently in the process of interviewing for. I am worried that he seemed mad/annoyed 4 months ago when I asked him to rename the file, and that he might change/edit the contents of the letter and say that I am rude/disrespectful/or something else to make me look bad, or even take out some parts of the letter and make it weak. I don't care about the file name anymore, I just need a letter sent, and I don't really have anyone else to ask. Do you think I should take the risk of asking this professor to sent the letter for me if I am worried that they might change the contents?

"Figure out if you REALLY need to go to college. Does the thing you're going to even pay well enough to merit going into debt for? A lot of young people go to college because they see it as the next natural step when in reality they're just delaying acting like an adult and going into debt for no good reason. A friend of mine spent four years and 200k to get a criminal justice degree and how makes $18 an hour and has a $1400 monthly payment for the next 12 years because she cant find a job that pays more. Is the thing you're going to study common? If so, go to an in state school. They're usually half the cost and will probably be equal if not better in quality. Depending on your state you may even qualify for merit scholarships that pay for most if not all of your tuition so all you have to pay is room and board. I know my state pays 100% of tuition for all students who graduated with a 3.0 higher in high school (of course you need to maintain average a certain GPA in college but that's a later problem that you'll have to deal with when you're there). A lot of people here are suggesting community college which I'm personally 50/50 on this approach. I did take the community college approach and attended what is essentially a glorified tech school for the first year of my college education. It cost me around $2000 for the entire year (thanks COVID) and I picked classes that I knew would transfer to the colleges I wanted to go to. I was able to work graveyard shifts at a warehouse during my first year allowing me to stash a lot of money for when I eventually transferred to a major university. I am now on track to graduate with my BSME in May. On the other side, I know a lot of transfer students at my current university who did a poor job planning their classes and spent two years at a community college and have nothing to show for it. They're going to end up spending 6-7 years to accomplish what an average student accomplishes in 4 because of transferring to a community college. A lot of people are suggesting talking to financial aid. This isn't a bad idea, but keep your expectations low. The reality is that it is not in the colleges interest to offer you any kind of aid. The reality is that you are easily replaceable with another young person who can pay their asking price for the education. If all else fails, time to get a loan like 90% of other students.

"Is it realistic to pursue a PhD at the intersection of pure mathematics and AI. I recently finished a BSc (special) in pure mathematics, with most of my focus on analysis — real analysis, functional analysis, topology, measure theory, etc. I’ve always been deeply passionate about pure math, but at the same time I’ve had a long-standing interest in computer science and AI. The problem is: I don’t have a strong background in AI or machine learning yet. Most of my training is theoretical mathematics. Still, I keep feeling that modern AI is becoming more and more mathematical, and that there should be a way to meaningfully combine these two interests rather than abandoning one for the other. I’m particularly drawn to the theoretical side — things like viewing neural networks as operators, stability and boundedness, optimization in infinite-dimensional spaces, mathematical foundations of learning, etc. I’m less interested in heavy engineering or purely applied work. So my question is: Is it realistic to aim for a PhD working at the intersection of AI and mathematics with a background like this? Are there established or emerging fields where someone coming from pure math (especially analysis / functional analysis) can genuinely contribute, even if they start with limited AI knowledge? If anyone here has taken a similar path, or works in theoretical ML / mathematical AI, I’d really appreciate your perspective — including what I should realistically prepare or learn next.

"1. Normally, I'd recommend staying at your job until you're starting grad school (or at least accepted). But if you've saved up so much you can afford to take time off, maybe it isn't the worst idea. 2. GRE at 90th percentile will be very difficult and unless your heart's set on joining a ""top 10"" school (i.e. CMU, MIT, etc.) and need a near-flawless C.V., at least some of this time is probably better dedicated elsewhere, particularly demonstrating your potential as a researcher. 3. Leetcode doesn't get you anywhere for grad school. It may help for the screening quizzes for big tech firms, but not much else. It'd be more valuable to dedicate this time to a research project. If you also want to become proficient at python, find some interesting public datasets and start an in-depth research project and use the PANDAS library to do data wrangling/analysis/visualization. Publish a jupyter notebook and/or portfolio that documents your project. This will show off skills that are relevent to both grad school and data science jobs. 4. For networking events, you might consider attending scientific conferences that are in your area of research (look at ACM and IEEE sponsored conferences). You might even meet some Principal Investigators (PIs) who you'd be interested in working with. Try to build up the courage to go talk to them during a break and/or after their presentations.

I would rather prefer to balance field work hours over papers, discussions and projects however if seems both programs have significant workloads regardless of field hours. Am I correct there?

For an undergraduate in an introductory course, I’m just happy to see they found a source and cited. Articles from such outlets show up in our library search tool, something I encourage students use when writing the assignment.

"Evaluating Journal Venues. Hey folks - I'm a new Assistant Professor in Electrical Engineering with research interests in power grids and distributed control/communication. I was looking at venues to publish journal articles - the usual method I use is to look at whether the journal is Q1, and impact factor, and whether my colleagues have also published there. I'm getting confused though with all these new journals that are ranked Q1, open access, and are new so they waive open access fees. Has anyone heard of Green Energy and Intelligent Transportation from Elsevier or e-Prime Advances in Electrical Engineering (Elsevier)? Both offer waiver of APC until the end of 2024. There are of course the coveted IEEE Transactions papers but they do take a lot of time to go through the review process and acceptance rate is quite low. IEEE Access is rated Q1 and is relatively quicker but can get expensive. I'm wondering whether the above two open access journals are reputable enough for me to try to publish in, and in general, what methods do you use to evaluate the journal?

"“Should I appeal my grade?”. Before you do, keep in mind that the following things will be true in most — but not all — such situations: * Your first step is to contact your professor to clear up any confusion you may have about your grade for the course. Students in this sub-Reddit always bring up contacting “the dean,” but I can assure you that this is not the way to go. If you do eventually figure out which dean to contact (it should probably be the dean of the college or division of which the professor in question is a member), and you email them without trying to communicate with your professor first, you are wasting the dean’s time. They will tell you that you should communicate with your professor first. * If your professor is ignoring you after multiple and appropriately spaced emails, then the appropriate next step is to contact _the department chair_, not a dean. * If you’ve emailed your professor and haven’t heard back and it’s been less than 24 hours since your email…wait until it’s been 24 hours before you take your next step. * If it’s been 24 hours since you sent your email and have heard no response from your professor, then hit “reply-all” on your original email and send a polite follow-up. Keep the email thread together. Don’t keep sending a new email over and over and over. * If no one is emailing you back, make sure that your campus is open. If it’s the end of Fall semester (like it is now), check your campus academic calendar to see if your campus is closed for the holidays. Faculty will more than likely not be emailing you back while on holiday. Be prepared to make your case for why you are appealing your grade. * On your campus website or in the course catalog, look up the instructions for the grade appeal process. Typically, but not always, you will need to demonstrate that your grade was the result of “arbitrary and capricious” grading. What does this mean…? ** You were graded according to something other than your performance in the course, ** Your performance was graded according to a standard different from the standard applied to other students, ** Your performance was graded by a method that departed _significantly_ from the grading method described to you at the beginning of the semester. * In your communications about the course, don’t include irrelevant information (“the professor canceled class too often” or “the exam covered material that was not explained well”). These may be legitimate complaints about a professor’s teaching, but they don’t provide evidence of “arbitrary and capricious “ grading. * If you want to submit a complaint about the professor’s teaching, remember that this is what course evaluations (a.k.a. student opinion polls) are for. You might also have other avenues for complaining about a professor’s teaching. However, most of what I see Redditors write here about such things with regard to appealing a grade would be seen as irrelevant. * Don’t write or say this: “Many other students are also unhappy with their grade.” Unless those other students also go through the process of initiating a grade appeal, your statement means nothing. Stick to describing your own experience, with evidence. If you do believe your performance was graded in an “arbitrary and capricious,” then you should absolutely appeal your grade. * I would suggest reaching out to the dean of students, assuming your campus has one, and asking for their assistance or advice. * Take some time to create a persuasive and professional appeal. * Have someone like the Dean of students look over what you e written and suggest improvements. * In what you write, make reference to and (perhaps) quote from the grade appeal policy on your campus. * Keep your focus on supporting this thesis: “My performance in this course was graded in an arbitrary and capricious manner” and then provide evidence to support your thesis. Anything else is irrelevant and gets in the way of a successful grade appeal.

"Was in your shoes just last year and currently on a good track so hopefully this writing will help you! For transparency currently in a CC with an aim at transferring to a 4-year next Fall. 1. Choose a school FAST. 4-year Unis might be hard to get into as some have expirations on the your placement levels and all that jazz. If you do not want to take on debt early on and a possible shot at a good 4-year Uni, go to Community College. Some CCs have programs and advisors to get you into 4-year unis where you can finish the rest there. Not sure if Marketing AS will do you justice so I'll keep writing this for a 4-year goal in mind, because that's the route im familiar with currently. READ THE PART ABOUT WORK STUDY now then go back to 2. 2. I see you said you have not filed your FAFSA yet, do this Like literally as soon as you see this comment as some colleges have a fixed amount of funding and is usually given out based on first-come basis even with regards to needs. -- How does FAFSA work? Your school gets a certain amount of $ to give it to those who need it most and most schools will again give it on first-come basis. Deadline is JUNE 30th. YES, this month so please go to FAFSA and add your chosen school there so they can get your aid info. 3. Scholarships - Dig deep into your college's website and apply. NOT ALL scholarships require a recommendation letter so dont get intimidated. On the plus side many allow you to have your previous employer to write you one. Friendly reminder to PLEASE not burn your bridges regardless of how horrible your job might be but I'm sure you're adult enough at this point! Check your state's financial aid grants. Some states will give a certain amount but you will have to go through the government system, in case your school fails to mention that. Most of them though usually end around the March period but again dig all over the internet for any opportunity! Those who have been in your shoes before will lend you a hand and reach out for you if you're willing to work for it so get grinding. 4. Work Study - Okay I did all those and I still need money. - Check with your school for Work Study. Before doing so, do your own math and see what will make sense. Part Time Job or Work Study? Some schools will pay you at the end of the semester a full amount for all that you worked, usually those that do that will do it in a fixed rate meaning, at the end of fall for example you get $3,000 for working 20 hours every week, for x weeks. Some schools will straight up just pay hourly but that's a bit different. So do the math if hourly/ end of the semester will help! Now if you want to take on lots of hour at work and keep a good track at school, look for jobs with lots of downtime. I have some friends who worked in parking structures or graveyard shifts where the bosses allow them to do homework and what not in the down time. 5. BE YOUR OWN COUNSELOR - Seriously cannot reiterate this enough. Get ready to do lots of googling and researching on your own. Some ""counselors"" cannot differentiate between IT and CS. while training other soon to be counselors. So do your own research in regards to everything, ESPECIALLY Picking classes/ switching a major. I lucked out and going to a great CC but had friends who's counselors were more corporate than for the student, I hope you're catching what I mean here. 6. Scheduling - It will seem intimidating at first, real college and all that, but if you are organized and focused you can crush lots of early prerequisite credits and I personally encourage that. Later on, you will need to take less credits to make up for hard classes. There is a formula online so people use for how much hours to dedicate a week per each credit, I personally go off of motivation so I didn't bother with that but perhaps it would work for you since you're just starting. Depends on how well you want to do in school, I suggest moulding your schedule around your most difficult classes. Meaning, are you very sharp and focused at 2pm, opposed to 9am lecture? Pick that 2pm slot for your hardest subject as you will need all that attention juice. 7. Picking Classes - Lots of people here and in general will down-vote me for this and it's understandable to a certain level, but Rate My Professor will come in VERY handy. Take all reviews with a grain of salt. You can tell the terrible students with bad habits who blame the profs rather than themselves easily so I personally dont get the hate RMP gets. You want to watch out for recurring themes like, UNORGANIZED, TEST DOES NOT MATCH LECTURES, clues like that. Personally the latter can be a student's foul lots of times but UNORGANIZED is deadly if repeated. You do not want to see a final exam grade set as 0 because you’re instructor is unorganized. DO NOT PICK AN easy A class for the sake of the grade, lots of times, especially in the STEM related classes you will be building a foundation. Like a house if you’re foundation is rotten, that A is not going to help you moving on forward. 8. Transfer Classes - If you aim to transfer to a 4-year university make use of their transfer credit per credit portal that most colleges will have. This will show you the CC classes you take and their equivalent at that uni. If you are undecided right now and likely that’s your case, go with the highest, most prestigious college that has a credit transfer portal with your college, this is usually your state university. The idea here is if the highest uni will accept those credits, chances are when it comes time for you to decide, if you pick a different uni they probably will accept those credits. That is again not always the case but a suggested one, again do your own research further. 9. Online Classes - Personally not a fan but If you are organized I’m sure it will help if the classes you need will effect your schedule. BEFORE taking an online class though check with your transfer school’s website if they accept that credit as transfer or not. Personally the uni I’m going to allows all classes but the Math, Sciences and stuff like that where class presence is a must and they list it, yours will probably have the same. 10. Transportation &amp; Emergencies - Life will do its thing and you might have a flat tire or in your case I think a bike would be great if you don't mind pedalling. Other alternative and by far the best is a cheap, used $400 - $700 moped to save on gas and still walk in to class relaxed to focus on what matters. In the case of emergency, keep your school in a loop. Had a really impoverished friend get funds to repair his car after letting the school now, so again keep your school in the loop. 11. Social Life - As most will suggest… School&gt;Sleep&gt;Social. There will come a time where sleep and social and completely out of the picture and you’ll just have to embrace that sleep deprivation with a cup of coffee and type on. Or write books in the reddit comment section! TL;DR: It’s a book not a comment lol. Those who worked hard can tell if you are working hard or messing around, if you show them your willing to fight, they will give you a lending hand and reach out for you. Make studying/ school/ education a hobby in some time of way that you enjoy, even if the subjects you despise, find the joy in them.

"Hey, I’m currently studying Industrial Engineering at UM and will be graduating next week. I know it’s not easy to find many of us, we’re a small school. There’s a lot of good and bad things to say about the college of engineering. I don’t know where you heard that UM is investing in engineering. I’d say it’s the opposite because we’re one of the smallest colleges and definitely low on everyone’s priority list. They just built a brand new chemistry building, but it doesn’t mean much for engineering unless you’re in CET and maybe BME. Our facilities are outdated, but they are making several renovations and have already renovated several classrooms with more to come. My worst experiences actually don’t come from engineering. It’s the prerequisite classes that are causing problems. The math and physics departments are an absolute mess. It’s so bad that they’re actually moving some of these classes so that you take them through the college of engineering and that will make everyone’s lives better. The good thing is that because we’re a small school we get the benefits of small class sizes, as well as having close relationships with professors and students. Literally everyone knows everyone and it’s quite easy to reach out to a professor whether it’s before/after class, and office hours. Another good thing is they value feedback. They’re making a lot of changes to study plans and teaching methods and that’s because they listen to students and genuinely care. I only have good things to say about the ISE department, literally amazing professors that do whatever it takes for students to succeed. They’re making additions to the curriculum and I’m so sad that I didn’t get the chance to take these new classes. I also have great things to say about the students.

"I'm dreading going back to the dental hygiene program in the spring. Advice. I'm an older college student (42F) and I just finished my first semester of the dental hygiene program and I'm dreading next semester. I knew this program would be hard but I don't think I could have guessed all the reasons why. They took in more students this year and seem to be struggling trying to find time to make sure we all had appropriate lab and clinic time but it isn't enough. The main problem comes with clinic. I don't get enough time with an instructor showing me how to use my tools properly. Although we have videos to watch at home and practice there is alot of things in the video we aren't allowed to do and the videos don't show you everything you need to see when instrumenting. It's incredibly frustrating as I know with assistance I could do well but there is none to be had and I'm struggling more than others. I've failed just about all my instrumenting exams and I've had to retake them. I failed my final by a point which would mean that I'm out of the program but they are allowing me to stay. The thing is a big part of me doesn't want to. Although all the instructors are nice I feel like it's a very toxic environment. I've had teachers tell me and other students that the program comes first, and family is second. I've gotten in trouble for crying in clinic (not with a patient, just during exams) and their motto seems to be ""fake it till you make it."" I typically can handle stress. I've had jobs were I was bitten, scratched, yelled at and so forth and never broke down. It's the constant pressure of school/the program.

If anything, I just go straight to sleep without realizing it. I've woken up multiple times on my desk in the middle of the night and just move myself to bed. To go back to the question I ask in the title, I keep thinking this it is solely my fault for not sitting down and actually studying productively. Everyday I think ""I will complete one lesson, then tomorrow another"" and then, I just don't. I know this is just plain procrastination, how does that compare to people with true mental health issues? **UPDATE: I sincerely thank everyone that replied to my post, after a few days (and a several mental breakdowns) I have made appointments with my doctor for a physical, a nutritionist, and am looking for a new therapist.

"Best way to go about asking a professor about the grading timeline. I'm taking a 200-level course, entirely asynchronous and online, in which my professor is somewhat new (their second semester at the university, I believe). Our term started January 18th, and I've submitted a total of seven writing assignments/quizzes since the semester began. No one in the class has heard anything back regarding grades. I completely understand that many people, professors and students alike, are facing unexpected turbulence due to the pandemic, and I truly am not upset about that. If that's the case, then I'd much rather my professor focus on themselves than grading our course. My only concern is that it has been well over a month since the semester started, and I have been submitting writing assignments without any feedback on where I stand. I'm not sure if the work I'm producing is the quality my professor expects, if there are any mistakes I'm making that are now downstream mistakes affecting all the rest of my work since I have no feedback, etc. This professor sent out a grading update last week and promised to have the grading completed by February 19th.

"I commented on your other post, and this one just popped up. I think there's a major difference between the creativity associated with innovative science, and being ""edgy"" just to be edgy. I guess I'd ask if there are ways for you to express your personality and creativity in your website without turning to 13-year-old edgelord aesthetics. Can you include pictures? An ""about me"" where you mention your hobbies? Have a page on your website that leans into this aesthetic, but that not everyone will click on?

"Hey, I’m really sorry you’re feeling this way. :( I’ve been living with depression on and off for about 20 years, so I get how heavy and overwhelming it can feel, it's f\*cking awful, isn't it? It sounds like you put so much into that essay, and it’s totally valid to feel crushed when something you worked so hard on doesn’t go the way you hoped. But honestly, it really doesn’t sound like it’s about you or your work—it seems like bias or unfair judging might’ve played a role, and that’s so frustrating when it’s out of your control. You see this correctly: That essay doesn’t define you—you’re still the same talented, thoughtful person who wrote it? It came out of your brain, which means you have the means to repeat stuff like that again and again. The ideas and effort you put into it didn’t just disappear. They’ve brought you further forward, not just academically but also as a person. You’ve grown from this experience, even if it doesn’t feel like it right now, I know. Now it just feels like shit, I get it. Have you thought about sharing your work in other ways? Like starting a blog or a Substack, or even posting it on Twitter or LinkedIn? There are so many people out there who’d love to read and engage with your ideas. It doesn’t have to end here, and it definitely wasn’t in vain. Also, try to be kind to yourself. I know from experience it’s easier said than done, lol, but small things—like going for a walk or doing something you used to enjoy—can help a little. And if you’re feeling this low, it might be worth talking to someone, like a counselor or therapist. They can help you work through this and find your way back to feeling like yourself. It is not good if the spiral is so far that you cannot leave your room. Nobody expects people to just heal a broken leg themselves, so you should not have to deal yourself with depression. Getting therapeutic help absolutely changed my life and the only thing I regret is that I did not start it earlier. You do not have to be alone in this, and it’s okay to ask for help.

"I need advice after being SAed. I (male in his 20s) was r\*ped by a college professor (female in her 50s) last spring semester. Essentially, I needed help on an assignment for her class. She invited me to a hotel because she stated that her office hours would not be happening. I went to the hotel. She came out in a bath robe, and started getting flirty with me. I brushed it off and wanted to keep it professional. She offered me lemonade to drink. I initially did not want to impose, but after she kept insisting, I did not want to be rude, so I drank it. I started feeling dizzy, and I fainted. I woke up and was tied down with ducked tape completely naked. My professor then started having anal and oral s\*x with me. I was dozed out, and I was fearful for my life. I am African American, so she pretended that I was a slave, and she pretended to be my slave master. She then whipped me several times while I was tied down. I kept begging her to stop. I had tears running down my face. She then took a knife and started cutting me in my thighs. Then, she let me go. I just ran away back to my dorm. When I took a shower, my cuts burned. I felt traumatized. I could not concentrate. I used to regularly go to office hours, but after I explained this situation to one of my professors, he told me that I should not complain because the professor who r\*ped me was tenured. After that conversation, he distanced himself from me, and when I went to office hours for three of my classes, the TA's started distancing themselves from me. One TA told me that he did not feel comfortable interacting with me. I had to withdraw with a W from three of my classes that semester. I did not drop the one with the professor who r\*ped me because if I did, she threatened to file an academic integrity case against me. Fast forward to the end of the semester. She asked me to be her boy toy after presentations. I told her that I did not want to do anything unprofessional. She filed several academic integrity cases against me. I lost one of them because the person handling it asked me uncomfortable questions about my assault, and when I refused to answer them, the found me responsible. As I was dealing with the aftermath of my assault, I took a summer course online. While taking that course, I made several suicide attempts, and I consequently failed that course. I got therapy for it. Then come fall semester, I was working on my fall classes. Then, after October 7, people started discriminating against Jewish students after the who Israel fiasco. When student found out I was Jewish, a few of them broke into my dorm room and beat me. The took my electronics. Then, one of them was gay, and he r\*ped me while others pinned me down. They did this on several different days throughout the fall semester. Then, they would graffiti on my room walls. They drew swastikas and wrote the n word. They would follow me into my classes. In the classes, they would do things like put their hands in my pants. They would pinch me. Then, afterwards, when I would leave, if I walked into a restroom or private location, they would follow me and beat me and SA me. I have made several attempts to take my own life. As a result, I failed all my classes for the fall semester. I have been doing research on what I can do, and I came across this pdf: [https://nwlc.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Supportive-Measures-FAQ-K12-vF.pdf](https://nwlc.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Supportive-Measures-FAQ-K12-vF.pdf) Are the Title IX coordinators required to do something about my failing grades?

"Unexpected Scholarship Fund Misallocation Has Put Me in a Tough Spot. Hi everyone, I'm currently facing a tricky situation with my university's handling of my scholarship funds and would really appreciate any advice or insights you might have. **Issue:** I recently found out that one of my scholarship installments was deposited into my family bank account instead of being applied to my tuition fees. This was unexpected because my previous scholarship payments were always applied directly to my tuition. There was no communication from the university about this change. I assumed these funds were part of my regular financial aid for living expenses and my family used them as such. Now, I'm facing an unexpected tuition balance of $5,000+ that I'm told is due in two months, with the possibility of interest charges. It's honestly thrown me off, both financially and emotionally, as I'm already stretched thin managing study and living costs. I'm wondering: 1. **Should I Pay or Dispute?** Is it reasonable to challenge this charge, considering the lack of communication from the university's end? 2. **Seeking an Extension:** Any tips on how to request more time to pay this balance? I'm trying to avoid spiraling into more debt. 3. **Avoiding Extra Costs:** If payment is inevitable, how can I at least keep away from additional interest charges? I've reached out to the university for clarification but am feeling quite lost and anxious while waiting for their response.

"5 Study Tips for University and College Students. **\[**[**Link to the original article.**](https://kofiscrib.com/blog/creative-virgo/study-tips)**\]** From kindergarten all the way to your last assignment in university, you bump into new and distinct learning obstacles. In the beginning, it was grasping entirely new concepts, such as reading, building passive and active memory, building habits. Then you moved over to the challenges of multi-tasking, having to retain focus, having to learn things even if you have no inherent interest or benefit from them. And then by the time you reach university, you most probably also need to juggle with a social life, a work-life, dealing with society’s expectations, and so on. Point is, you keep on learning new things, but the ways you learn them are probably not very different than they were years and years ago. And even if they were relevant back then, there is little chance that they are the perfect study techniques that should be carrying you all your life. Generally, the older we get, the less nimble we are at adapting new study strategies, even if there is quite some evidence showing that they are actually better. When I went into university in 2019 for my Biomedical Engineering degree, I had quite a bit of old study habits that made me spend so much unnecessary time and effort in the wrong places. And since nobody really teaches you how to, well, learn effectively, it is very easy to keep grinding unnecessarily till you graduate. Thankfully, I ran into some really helpful articles and YouTube channels, mainly Ali Abdaal’s and Thomas Frank’s, that gave me a good idea of how to study much more effectively. In this article, I will tell you about the 5 study tips that help me most during my degree in university. 1. Active Recall Active recall \[**ˈæktɪv rɪˈkɔːl**\] when you actively stimulate your memory for a piece of information. \[1\] In order to better understand what active recall is, it is easier to understand what it isn’t. Making notes and studying off them is a passive way of absorbing content. The questions and the answers are both there in front of you, and you instantly see the connection between all the concepts. It doesn’t really take any active effort on your part to get to the answer, and you are left with the feeling of a job well-done since you understand the information as of right now. However, once I take your notes away from you, your understanding of the topic is likely to suffer. Now that there is some distance between the question and the answer to it, your brain actually needs to put in the work. And that’s awesome. Because this is where the real learning magic happens. Once your brain needs to put in some active effort to retrieve a given piece of information, it helps build a neural pathway in your cortex. Think of it as the same way your brain builds habits, reflexes, etc. The more your brain needs to go through a specific motion, the easier it gets, and the information starts to feel instinctual as if it has always been there. So to put it into practical terms, you can practice active recall by turning your notes into a set of questions on the content. Yes, you can also provide the answers to them somewhere, but they shouldn’t be instantly visible. You have to work through the question first, put some effort into remembering, and then if you actually don’t know it, you’re allowed to look at the answer and learn the new material. Evidence shows that this method of learning, combined with using flashcards, can boost the speed of integrating new material and can enhance memories. 2. Time-Blocking Now, this technique is much more common among the productivity spaces, but it has its place in studying as well. Time blocking is the process of taking the 24 hours of a given day and dividing them into blocks of closely-related activities. It is very close to the general practice of scheduling events into your day, just taken a step further. Some small tasks during the day can seem harder to accomplish if they are scattered randomly throughout it. This is because of the **multi-tasking** effect. Generally, it takes some amount of willpower to start a given task, and if you constantly have to switch between tasks of a different level of mental effort and focus, you will end up drained much faster. Time-blocking helps in this by letting you couple a few tasks and their subtasks into coherent blocks. For example, you could have a Blog Writing block, like what I use right now, in which I do a couple of related tasks - writing all the paragraphs, writing some meta-information about the blog, designing the page, sharing it on social media, etc. 3. Plan for Buffer If you can be sure about one thing about productivity, it is that a task has a much bigger chance of taking longer than expected, rather than shorter. When you start using the previous concept, time-blocking, you may easily fall in the trap of overlooking all your time. When you put a 2 hour gym block right next to a 2 hour study block, you depend heavily on you being able to finish those tasks perfectly on time and being able to transition perfectly smoothly to the next one. Which, especially if the two tasks require you to change setting, place, clothes, environment, can become impossible to start the next task perfectly on time. This is where **buffer time** comes in handy. Buffer time could be just a few minutes, or even an hour more of time added to a task. The main principle is to estimate how long a given task would take, and add some time to extend the time block, imagining an almost worst-case scenario of things not going your way. That could be - your bus not being on time, your computer being laggy, creativity not striking you the moment you sir down to write, etc. By adding buffer time to your schedule, you won’t be rushing through tasks as much, and you would limit the possibility of stuff going so wrong that your whole schedule goes off-track. This margin of error is crucial to a healthy schedule. 4. Get outside of your room What could seem rather obvious for the more extroverted people can come as non-instinctual to the more introverted of us. When you sit down in your room, it is very rarely a dedicated study space. It is usually also the place where you sleep, relax, sometimes eat, generally - the place where you don’t work. And as far as psychology goes, classical conditioning works very efficiently on humans, and the more we associate a given setting with a given task, the more likely we are to perform said task in said setting. This means that over time, it should be getting less and less natural for you to work I your own room, since you do all sorts of activities in there. This is where the library, coffee shops, other people’s places, common rooms, become so useful in one’s studying. Since there is a constant feeling of novelty attached to those places you don’t visit as often, it almost feels fun to study there, and definitely feels more productive. On top of that, you have the added bonus of not having all your distractions (fridge, bed, TV) right in front of you as you’re trying to study. 5. Coffee is not Water Now, this line may seem absurd, but if you’re a coffee-enjoyer like myself, you’ll know how easy it is to go overboard with 1, 2, even 5 cups of coffee per day, mostly in an attempt to constantly boost your productivity. However, coffee is not water, and its effect on the organism as a stimulant shouldn’t be underestimated. The caffeine in coffee truly does affect your mental and physical performance, and it’s the reason why athletes and students alike tend to take it in big quantities.

"Officially graduated today! Reflecting &amp; celebrating 🍾🎓. Today is the day I officially graduate from my Master of Public Health program. This is a momentous day, marking the end of a long journey filled with uncertainty and numerous setbacks. Today is the day that I can finally say, I am done with college! The path I took to get to this day has been long and difficult. This day marks the end to a 13-year journey of struggle marked by self-discovery, life-threatening medical issues, five changes in declared majors, an early career change, learning to adjust to a new normal of disabled living and learning, moving across the country twice, starting a family with a NICU baby, a deep depression, and navigating a pandemic. I’m sure there were more hurdles, but these were some of the most salient. There are only three people in my life who truly understand the gravity of the hurdles I faced during this time period. And maybe just one other person, my spouse, who can almost fully appreciate the importance of this day. I am 31, turning 32 next month. Today I will graduate from my MPH program. I graduated with my BSPH when I was 29. I entered a deep depression when I was 26, after the passing of my aunt Diane in the same year. Also in the same year, I had a second surgery to remove an angioma from my brainstem, which subsequently left me with permanent neurological damage impacting my ability to see, feel, eat, talk, hear, and ambulate. When I was 25, I was majoring in Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience at an R1 University. At age 24, I married my spouse and left the workforce to finish my higher education. At age 22, I was living in Los Angeles working in Hollywood on live television shows. At age 21, I completed a technical certificate in Audio Engineering and Live Sound Reinforcement. At age 20, I underwent my first surgery to remove a portion of the angioma in my brainstem. At age 19, I was accepted into Columbia College in Chicago to begin my undergrad in Clothing Design and Merchandising. This pursuit was ended abruptly with my first brain surgery the next Spring, less than 4 months before I was scheduled to move to Chicago. When I was 18, I was forced to begin college coursework at Lansing Community College, before I was ready to enter higher education. I failed my classes due to a variety of reasons, one of the most important being my lack of a driver’s license and inability to reliably travel 45 minutes from my home to campus when needed for coursework and exams. The nuance of these setbacks is lost in this summary, but the details should not detract from the joy I feel on this day of achievement while I reflect on my accomplishments despite the hurdles I have faced. It is simply amazing what someone can accomplish when they feel supported and encouraged to pursue their interests and work towards their goals. For those who are struggling, there is light at the end of the tunnel. Your accomplishments matter, and you matter. Edit: Thank you everyone for the karma and the congrats.

I hold regular office hours, respond to emails (even if just to tell them to check the syllabus), provide actionable feedback. I got a lot of complaints that an assignment wasn't clear, but a quick glance at my syllabus would prove it was--students just didn't read it, and then got points off for not following instructions.

Hold to draw a straight line and different shapes, all the colors I could ever want, highlighters, the ability to quickly jump to any page/section, copy/paste, I can copy in things from PowerPoint presentations, the book, or pdfs, or even my own pictures, also has a pdf copy of all the books from my classes, I have the notes for every class I’ve taken with me at all times so if I need to review some diff EQ process to solve a physics problem I have it with me, I can easily use any type of paper from page to page from lined to graph to engineering paper. Finally I also have a keyboard for it so I can also use python directly on it in a pinch and do word processing.

"What are your best study methods. As the title states, what are some of your best study methods?

"3rd year pre-tenure review seems impossible. I’m finding it impossible to meet my college’s expectations for 3rd year review. They want a minimum of 3 published journal articles per year, but their definition of “year” is working against me. I started my position as research faculty at an in Sept 2023. My “first year review” was in Oct. 2023. So they essentially count my hellish and fruitless year as a postdoc as my first year as a PI. My third year review, which is the point at which I can lose my job for low research output, is in Oct. 2025. And they will only accept fully published works—nothing in press or in revision. The review turnaround in my field is about 9 months. So anything that will count will have to be submitted by now, halfway through my second year. With these two factors together, the expectation was for me to submit 6 papers in a year and a half. This same year and a half included setting up my lab (i.e. purchasing all equipment, getting IRB, hiring and training personnel, developing my experiments, and crossing my fingers that I get publishable results) and concurrently teaching (2 new preps). They also want me to have secured external funding by 3rd year review. I’m in an experimental field—I can’t just sit down and write a paper, it takes months to get an experiment going. My dept chair keeps saying “well hopefully you had stuff in the pipeline from your postdoc, and you can count collaborations.” WHY would my job depend on work that comes out of other people’s labs? This just seems unfair. I had a bad postdoc and a horrible PI who pulled me off my papers; I already had to deal with that, and now it’s going to ruin my career as an independent researcher too?

"FA Question. Could use some help to ease my anxiety. Okay, so story first, last year I lived in Portland and was attending classes at PCC. My mother who is 85 had a significant health scare that made me immediately up and move back to California to be with her. Broke my lease, withdrew from all my classes, packed what I could in my car and left. The Grant I received at PCC was returned to the feds in its entirety. But I now owe PCC the money that was returned. I started up school again this summer in California. Starting completely new which sucks but it’s fine as I didn’t have many credits to transfer to begin with. I didn’t need transcripts from PCC. I have two weeks left in this semester. With all the mess going on with FASFA, we haven’t received 24-25 offer letters yet but I have my offer letter for 23-24 in which I qualify for the PELL Grant for summer semester. Am I going to run into issues receiving the PELL for summer semester if I still owe PCC? Please keep in mind that I don’t owe to the government. Just to the school itself. Financial Aid office states I am eligible to receive my PELL grant for summer semester but they are waiting for FASFA to get their stuff together after major changes and the waiting makes me anxious, like something it gonna hinder my eligibility.

"How do I get my Masters without going into crippling debt. I was a first-generation college student/child of immigrants. I’m currently a PR specialist for a hospital, and I’d like to grow in my career one day, but there’s not really another position for me to move up to (that i know of) other than “Director of Comms” To my knowledge, these days you need a Masters for those kinds of positions, and I am on a pretty modest salary. I know people often say in comms you need more experience as opposed to education in order to get a job, but based on looking at the LinkedIn of everyone who works above me, I honestly don’t think I’ll be able to move up vertically without it. My hospital will only contribute around 2-4k if I were to go back to school, and I’m not sure how i’d be able to afford it without taking out so many loans. I can’t afford to take 1-2 years to focus on it full time, and I can’t afford the 70k minimum i’m being quoted for different programs. I really don’t want to go into debt. I honestly have no clue how people are affording going back to school. Are there specific scholarships I should be applying for? Are there other options? Is there something I’m missing here? I have no idea where to start. Any help would be appreciated. EDIT: I’ve gotten a lot of different responses ranging from “70k isn’t expensive” to “never pay 70k is too high,” for some added context I was looking for universities local to DC area and was unable to find a strategic comms MBA program at a decent school that would total beneath 70k without financial aid (35k a year). I don’t currently have the time to be a graduate assistant or an additional job to my full time, my full time is 9-5 (sometimes 7-8) and is pretty demanding as PR asks a lot in terms of off-hours—i’d have to take these classes at night or most likely online i’m learning.

"Had an anxiety attack while giving a presentation today. Hi all, I (24F) am a first-semester MSIS/MA student in archives/history. Had my last class of the semester today, and had to present my semester's work for the course in front of the class. The presentation was only 15 minutes, and as soon as I opened my mouth (before I even felt anxious mentally) my voice was quivering and my mouth felt totally dry. Got gradually worse as I kept forcing myself through the next fifteen minutes, to the point where by the end of it, I could barely formulate sentences and totally and completely forgot much of the information that I had spent the semester researching. Sat down in my seat after it was all over and started crying, but didn't even realize till I felt my face. Which means that classmates probably observed this before I even noticed. I've always had trouble with presenting and public speaking, but it's gotten less severe over time. In elementary and middle school, I would literally nervous-laugh-to-sob in front of my classes until my teachers let me sit down. By the end of undergrad, I was generally okay but still clearly nervous and totally unable to riff without a script. The last time I presented in person before this was for my undergraduate school's Humanities Symposium, where I stumbled over my words and stuttered my way through a presentation in front of my college's president and the university system's chancellor (along with my family, at-the-time boyfriend, friends, and classmates). I apologized to my senior project advisor afterwards and all he could offer me was ""Eh, just a bit of nerves."" I figured this would've subsided by the time I got to grad school. I've been waitressing since I was a teenager, which has taught me some public speaking-adjacent skills. I've come out of my shell quite a bit since undergrad, and I felt totally confident going into this. It's totally humiliating to still be dealing with this in grad school. These should be skills I have already learned. I should have gotten to a point in my life and my academic career where this isn't an issue for me any longer. Even classmates who presented nervously or read directly off a script weren't nearly as bad as I was. Has anyone else ever had experience with this? I don't know what to do to help myself here, and I'm feeling so humiliated that I'm considering that I might not be cut out for this. I feel like there is something deeply wrong with me or something.

"So we're now a couple of years into AI. How do you reckon it's affected your education. I use it to make my life easier, not cheat. It’s a tool if you use it that way, and it has made me a smarter student because I use AI to tutor me, guide my research, and help when I’m stuck on a problem. Not long ago, you had to leave your home, make an appointment, and pay money for a tutor who was often half as effective at explaining something complex. Now I can say, “I’m confused by this paragraph,” and keep asking questions until I fully understand it. It’s especially helpful for advanced math or science. People who use it to write entire essays and hand them in without learning anything are missing the point of AI and how powerful it can be. AI opens a world of education that was previously only available to people who could afford the best tutors and resources. Yes, you can use it to cheat, but you can also use it to study properly, save time, and become more knowledgeable. Good professors will adapt instead of trying to catch cheats. AI is not going anywhere, and it is not going to ruin education, it is going to change how education is taught and make learning more accessible. Our great great grandparents rode horses because that was the most advanced and practical technology of their time. When cars were invented, many people resisted, they were noisy, unfamiliar, and even frightening. Some argued they would never replace horses. Over time, society adapted, roads changed, cities changed, jobs changed, and new skills became necessary. Today, we do not question whether cars belong, we simply learn how to drive. AI is similar, it may feel disruptive or uncertain right now, but it is not going away. Like every major technological shift before it, the advantage will go to the people who learn how to use it, shape it, and work alongside it rather than resist it. Adapting does not mean losing what makes us human, it means expanding what we are capable of",Faculty,Medium,1.0,web:reddit:r/students:comments,Medium,1,1976,355,6,So we're now a couple of years into AI.,0

Sorry if I'm a bit rambly. I'm a bit stressed and can't condense my thoughts very well. My top interest is conflict resolution and problem solving. Listening to people complain for an hour and trying to figure out the actual problem is a lot of fun. Someday I'd like to go into landlord/tenant law, but I need a fallback just in case. I'm also into politics right now, which I think is because I like reading both sides of the argument and complaints and trying to find the truth. I also like history, and currently I'm into philosophy. I really like management and trying to organize teams and the various personalities. I loved working at a thrift store and trying to figure out prices for things if that helps. I'm also good with kids, older people, and animals. I've been told I have really good communication skills. I know I'll never be a STEM major, and that's okay. I struggle with math, and currently I'm trying to figure out how to read textbooks and get the information I need. I think that's because I never went to school and am trying to build the neuron pathways. I might have an actual learning disability for math, and my brain can't process doing two things very well.

The teacher didn’t give us a length for the paper, instead just saying however much we needed to write to cover the topic since the press releases were different lengths. I understood that and figured they probably differed by a few pages. Today I found out that the four press releases assigned to the four different groups are the following sizes: 10 pages, 11 pages, 38 pages, and 42 pages. I’m in the 42 page group and this means my required reading/research is over 4x as long and my paper is expected to be longer as well! It seems really unfair that we’re expected to do 4x the amount of work for the same grade, but do I have any ground to stand on to complain or escalate this? This teacher has been extremely uncompromising the whole semester, so I feel like talking to him won’t help. He also isn’t very understanding or sympathetic to student workloads - changing the syllabus halfway through the semester to add on an extra project he did not original put in the syllabus, and then two weeks later changing two of the projects from group projects to individual. Would escalating this be of any use or should I just suck it up and accept that life isn’t fair?",Faculty,Medium,1.0,web:reddit:r/college:search:unfair grading,Medium,1,1401,254,6,Professor assigning uneven workloads.,0

"How to improve the conditions of my schools Chemistry Department. I’m going to admit that a lot of this comes from pettiness, but it’s kinda got me at a point where I’m genuinely questioning this. To make a long story short, I feel like my schools Chemistry department is currently “broken” and I want to know how other people view this. To make it short; I feel as those professors and lab instructors power and authority is uncontrolled and results in students always getting the very short end of the stick. A few examples; - There were two different professors teaching Orgo; I had a friend that took the other teacher and we genuinely ended up learning different material, like different reactions and everything - In future courses they expected students to know the reactions my professor taught and the other students were screwed and had to learn them from scratch - The department head position is rotated between different people every couple years. The previous head was overworked so hard he ended up having to drop all classes he was teaching his last semester to just focus on the work of department head - The current department head never wanted to be it but ended up with the position after someone else weaseled their way out of it, he’s currently doing the bare minimum Then the following were all done by one lab professor; - Canceled a lab session on one day of a week to go to the concert, she forced all the students in the lab to find a different session in the week they could attend - Canceled a lab for a dentist appointment and did the same as above - Did everything but mandate students had to arrive 45 minutes early to lab because the actual lab would go over the normal 4 hour block the college slots for the lab and she wanted it to end at normal time - She held a bias towards students on sports teams, she would often chat with people on sports teams and help them as needed and often expressed annoyance with other students Then the final issue I can think of is that with labs we have lab journals we have to keep. I have taken 6 different chemistry classes with labs and every single one with a different instructor and a different method of keeping the lab notebook, it seems completely subjective. I have kinda reached my breaking point with this, I understand the course Carrie’s a natural burden of difficult material, but it feels like this extra stuff is only making it worse. So basically again, I just want to know if I’m just being petty and annoyed with normal things, or if I have some genuine complaints to bring up. I do have a few additional things but I already feel this is long enough and this is some of my biggest complaints in my mind.

This situation is making me feel a bit for our kids when they can’t get through things we find simple, like registration. So, I need three college credits in interior design to finish a certification. I tried two years ago but all I could find were online certficate programs, not ones for college credit and the place I’m getting this cert from denied them, they have to be 3 college credits from an accredited university.

I applied and paid my fee and was admitted but couldn’t register for the class because I wasn’t declared an int design major.

Its history unfolds through the rise of the Duchy of Bohemia and its integration into the Holy Roman Empire. After enduring periods of Habsburg rule, Nazi occupation, and communist governance, the nation embraced democracy during the Velvet Revolution in 1989. The peaceful split from Slovakia in 1993 marked the birth of the Czech Republic, now a thriving democratic nation within the European Union, blending a rich historical tapestry (which can be seen around Prague through historical architecture and monuments as well as across the Czech Republic with its many castles) with a modern and dynamic identity. Here's a glimpse into our programs: **BSc Economics and Management (3 or 4 years):** Our bachelor's degree program provides a robust foundation in core business subjects such as Finance, Economics, Marketing, Project Management, Logistics, and Human Resources Management. Tailored to both B2 and B1 English levels, the 4-year option includes preparatory courses in the first year, maintaining the priority of issuance for a ""Study visa"" at Czech embassies vs a visa for a standard Preparatory program. **MSc Innovation Project Management (2 years):** Choose between Innovation Project Management or Chemical Industry tracks within our Master of Science program. While the latter includes additional chemistry and industry-focused courses, both cover key subjects like Finance, Marketing, Project Management, Logistics &amp; Supply Chain Management, and Process Management.

"Is bullying normalized in Irish institutions. **TL;DR:** I was hired by a PI who wanted credit on multiple research projects I had completed before joining the institute. When I refused to add him and his associates as authors on work they had not contributed to, he began systematically bullying me, isolating me at work, and threatening my job and visa. **Long version (lengthy, but necessary to show the severity)** An Indian professor from a leading European university contacted me on LinkedIn. We work in the same research area and come from the same state and language background. He offered me a postdoc position, which I accepted. The nightmare soon started. Even before I joined the postdoc, and while I was still employed at my previous institute, he was quite obsessed with research papers. At that time, I have 30+ research papers, mostly in Q1 high-impact journals. I have published in journals with impact factors of 28 and 20, and many papers in journals with impact factors above 10. I am not a genius or anything, but let’s say I am a nerd with almost zero social life who has spent most of my time either coding/research, and I am lucky to have a master’s degree in two different domains and a Ph.D. in AI, which made my research genuinely novel. Months before my joining date, while I was still employed elsewhere and awaiting my visa, the PI demanded that I add his name and the names of two of his friends to a manuscript I had been working for several months with my students. We were about to submit the manuscript at that point. He had contributed nothing to the hypothesis, coding, analysis, or writing. Hell, he wont even able to understand much of the paper as it is highly interdisciplinary and he is a pure CS, but anyway the journal we were able to submit have 13 impact factor and that made him want that. After my visa was approved, his first response congratulations, and a reminder to publish papers with his name on them. A week before I left for Europe he messaged demanding to know when I am going to submit the manuscript. On my second day at the institute, before I even received an institute ID card, he demanded a list of all papers I planned to submit and Want to add him to all of my papers. That dumbo want to be first author too in some. Despite my coauthors are my own students, needlessly to say they are super pissed and well I am pissed too. Worked for months and now three \*\*\*\*\*\*\* demanding to be added. That is when I took the stand and told him. When I clearly refused to add his friends, he asked whether I could at least add him alone. Hilariously, he went further and suggested that I withdraw already submitted papers and resubmit them with his name. I refused. After I refused to add his associates as authors, he began to corner me. In almost every meeting, he made indirect remarks about me and spoke to me harshly without any valid reason. He also started reprimanding me publicly in the lab WhatsApp group, deliberately doing it in front of everyone. Although he outwardly said he was “okay” with my refusal, it was clear that he was not. He soon resumed pressuring me to add his friends to my research papers. All of this happened within the first 10 to 15 days of my postdoc. He did not stop even during the winter break and Christmas holidays. He kept pushing me about papers and authorship when everyone else was on leave. In the first week of January, I clearly told him that I would not entertain this anymore. I explained that my students were prepared to file a complaint with the journal editors if forced authorship continued, which could lead to a retraction. I also told him that I could not afford a retraction in the early years of my research career. His response was immediate and blunt. He told me to quit the job. This was around my 20th working day as a postdoc. The same day I refused again to add his friends’ names, he removed me from the team WhatsApp group. I was shocked and genuinely afraid that he was about to fire me. Out of fear, I begged him to add me back to the group. He refused. From that point onward, the bullying intensified. In every meeting after that, he repeatedly told me to quit and go elsewhere. He openly used my visa status against me, fully aware that my visa was tied to my job. He made these comments in front of other lab members and PhD students. He also explicitly warned me not to speak about this to anyone, including on social media or to colleagues. The bullying became more severe. He openly mocked me, made demeaning remarks, and repeatedly said things like, “Let’s see who will hire you,” and “Let’s see who will give you a hosting agreement for your visa.” Because my legal status depended on my employment, I endured this treatment for one to two months He did not even hide his discrimination. In fact, during meetings, he would not even talk to me directly. For example, if he wanted me to send an email, he would not tell me himself. Instead, he would ask my lab mate to tell me to send the email, even though I was sitting right in front of him. He would talk, smile, and joke with everyone else, but when it came to me, he would turn cold and drop his smile completely. This really affected me. My first stint in Europe and all I want was a peaceful environment to work By the end of the third month, a particularly serious incident occurred. I was in a meeting with three lab members, this PI, and another professor from a different department who came from the same Indian state. During that meeting, the PI said in our shared mother tongue words equivalent to: “If someone is disobedient, I will chase that person back to India.” The statement was far more aggressive than it sounds in translation. The other professor present was visibly shocked and immediately questioned why he would speak like that. After that incident, I reached my breaking point and seriously considered leaving and returning to my home country. The abuse had gone too far. On top of this, he did not allow me to work peacefully. Within a week of my joining, he had already told me to stop working on the project I was officially hired for. He told me instead to continue publishing in a different domain (A domain I have multiple research papers at that point), claiming that he had approval from higher authorities. However, once I refused to add his friends as authors, he reversed his position and suddenly questioned how my work aligned with the funded project. When I then shifted my focus back to the project I was hired for, he sent me a special issue and instructed me to work on that instead, even though it was completely unrelated to the funded project. In the next meeting, overwhelmed and frustrated, I raised my voice at him. He was taken aback. It is important to note that I was his first postdoc, and he had been at the institute for only about Four years himself. After this confrontation, he informally shifted me to report to a senior professor who was the head of the lab. Lets say that senior professor is million times better than him but he did not considered me like his team too. I began reporting to the senior professor, but I was not officially part of his group, and he never treated me as a member of his group. I was excluded from group meetings, and apart from meeting him once a month, there was essentially no interaction. I accepted this situation because he did not criticize my work and consistently gave positive feedback, usually saying that I was doing well. This is how things continued for the next few months. I tried to explain to him the abuse I had experienced under the Indian PI. He acknowledged that it was wrong but clearly tried to brush it off and showed little interest in discussing it further. I mainly wanted to share my side of the story, as I knew the Indian PI would present a distorted version of events. Later, I realized that the Indian professor was still officially my PI. As a result, when contract extensions were discussed, he recommended extensions for everyone else except me. I expected this to some extent, but I still hoped the senior professor would intervene, especially since he regularly praised my work in monthly meetings and acknowledged that I was working hard. In the end, he told me that he was not my official PI and that the decision rested entirely with the Indian PI. It still surprises me that someone so junior could exercise this level of control and ultimately succeed. I am currently applying to other labs With in the institute and universities, but I have completely lost faith in European universities. I expected this kind of politics in India or in a so-called third-world country, but not in Europe, which is known for strong worker protection and labour rights. I am seriously considering returning to my home country or moving to another European country. At the same time, I am wondering whether I should file a formal complaint. Since I have only one week left on my contract, I feel that I have very little to lose. Should I first raise this with the Head of Department, who still does not fully know what happened, and if I do not receive a satisfactory response, escalate it to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC)? How do Irish institutions usually handle cases like this? Do they tend to side with senior professors, or with researchers who are being bullied? This involved coercive gift authorship combined with explicit threats linked to my visa. From what I understand, gift authorship is being taken increasingly seriously in Europe, and if this situation becomes public, it could damage the department’s future funding, especially since my postdoc was funded by an organization that has strict policies against bullying and harassment. Honestly, I had heard of bullying and discrimination before, but not to this extent. When I discussed this on other subreddits, I received mixed responses. About half of the people said I should go ahead and file a complaint because this is serious and that no university would support the professor in such a case. The other half were more skeptical. What is the reality?",Examination,High,2.0,reddit:r/academia,High,2,10138,1807,5,Is bullying normalized in Irish institutions.,0

"Reading faster is useless if you forget everything — here's what actually worked for me. We all have the same problem. You read a chapter, close the book, and 2 days later you can't remember a single thing. You highlight, re-read, take notes — still nothing sticks. The issue isn't how fast or slow you read. It's that reading without active recall is just passive scanning. Your brain never encodes it. I've been using an app called FastReadi that finally solved this for me. You upload any book (PDF, EPUB, URL, whatever) and speed read it. But the real value is what happens after: * AI generates flashcards from each chapter automatically * You get a comprehension quiz right after reading * Score low? Your speed adjusts down. Score high? It goes up * Spaced repetition schedules your reviews at the perfect time * Set an exam date and it builds a daily study plan for you So instead of just reading and hoping you remember, it's: read → quiz → flashcard → review.

Don't use your university email to apply for positions, you might not have access to it after you graduate. Doing well in classes * Go to class. I skipped more than my fair share of classes, and wish i hadn't. Sure for larger classes the prof wont remember you weren't there. but for upper level classes of &lt;50 people? you bet theyll remember. Also, you are paying to be there. * Do the assignments. If you think you know the material, do the assignment anyways. It might show up verbatim on an exam down the road. * Go to office hours, and participate in class. When I was a TA, you know what sucks? not having class interaction. it gives the professor no indication what they are doing is good for the class. Odds are, if you've got a question, someone else in the class as the same one. If you dont fell comfortable in classes asking questions, go to office hours. * no shame in getting a tutor, i spent a number of hours in the math lab/writing center. * See if the international version of a text book exist. or use the previous versions if possible. This might not work for classes that have online portals (mathmatica, peirs, etc.) and which case you are SOL. I found this tapers off once you are in 300-400 level classes. * Set aside time to study, and find what works for you. you might need 10 hours a week for one class, and less than an hour for another. but set aside study time each week. Its better to study a little be each day/each week, then try to cram for an exam the day or two before. Study groups can help as well, you might get a topic and help some one else that needs your explanation, or vice versa. * The rubber duck test always works. If you dont have a study group, explain it to an inanimate object (hence the rubber duck). I found the best way for me to learn something was try to teach it to someone else. Also helps for public speaking. * Try to find a place outside of your dorm/apartment for studying. It makes it where ""home"" isn't as stressful, and you separate out those two aspects. The past year of working from home has taught me the benefit of having a separate ""work space"" from ""relaxing space."" My campus library was open till 3am every day, and 24/7 during exam weeks. Also, you can always find an open class room. * **keep your notes.** I still go back an look at notes for work stuff. If you dont think your notes are organized. Do what i did. short hand notes during class, then that evening or after class if you've got a break, rewrite into a coherent way. Do the same thing at the end of the year if youd like.

General life/social life * everyone is different, and not everyone will like you. and **that is okay.** People in the same major can make great friends/study partners. * Internships are great, try to get one. **DO NOT PAY FOR AN INTERNSHIP, NOR GET AN UNPAID IF YOU CAN HELP IT.** if a place says pay some money to get our supplies, training, whatever. its not worth your time, or is an outright scam. unpaid internships are wack too. This somewhat applies to national collegiate groups as well, they generally don't matter, and Ive never had an employer ask about it. * i tried to have friends over once a month to play games/chill. harder to do in a dorm, but maybe a local cafe will let you have a room for a few hours, or find an empty class room. * if you want to join the bar scene/greek life. do so, but dont make it your life. * take showers and do your laundry for the love of god. please dont show up to class post-workout with all the sweat. its just as distracting as 4 day old unwashed BO. You dont need to wear makeup or be sparkly clean, just dont show up stanky. Beyond those 2 things, literally no one will care what you wear/ look like. * if you've got a kitchen, its easier to do dishes as the come up then let them sit and do them at the end of the week. Besides roaches and maggots are gross. * Learn to cook if you are able, its generally cheaper and healthier than D-hall. plus its an easy way to make friends/ SO's.

"I could really use some advice. I’m in a cohort-based master’s program and it feels like I’m the only one who is actually invested in being here. **The Dilemma** I am currently overseas in a MA program that is facilitated by a US institution of higher education and to put it bluntly. it isn't what I signed up for. I was prepared to enter a critical space that was academically rigorous but it hasn't been and a lot of that has to do with my cohort. Every. Single. Week. We talk about issues in international education (the focus of our MA program) and my peers have somehow made it this far without the self-awareness to acknowledge or even recognize that THEY ARE DOING EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE SAYING IS WRONG. Traveling every weekend, unabashedly being tourists, avoiding meaningful engagement with the local community. They fail to grasp simple concepts in class and none of them have the basic experiences I expected them to have out of their undergraduate careers. One of my peers espouses misogynistic rhetoric and does not have the wherewithal to recognize it, nor the drive to actually question and change their behavior when it is pointed out. I feel like every other day is an episode out of The Office, and I'm Jim just looking straight into the camera with that look that says, ""Are you getting this? Is this actually happening?"" I mean, there are times when I am literally sitting in class, waiting for my professor to give me a subtle head nod, before jumping into a conversation and *explaining* a topic to my peers or answering a question that no one else can, simply because they didn’t review the assigned readings. I’m almost certain that one of my peers is using ChatGPT to do their work, judging by the clear inconsistencies in their written assignments. They also proudly talked about using random excerpts from academic articles for a recent assignment we had, completely missing how the point of the assignment was to thoroughly review relevant literature. I feel, more often than not, that I am back in high school; my peers have labeled me as ""the smart one"" and ""the overachiever"" when I am literally just doing the work. On top of that, I overworked myself in order to afford being here, yet my peers are being sponsored by their parents and treat this program as a vacation. Worse is that they have an expectation of a degree at the end of the program, regardless of their effort, and I am almost convinced that the school we attend is under pressure to pass everyone even if they only put in a minimal effort. I feel so tense all the time, and things really piqued for me a few days ago when I openly maligned political apathy in class and my peers felt obligated to give poor excuses as to why they didn't vote in the US presidential elections before imploring that we just ""move on"" from the topic of the presidency. **What's Next?** I feel like the obvious answer to this dilemma is to double down on my independent research, utilize my relationships with my professors for personal and professional growth, and continue networking outside of the classroom. I should mind my own business and let my peers determine what they are going to get out of this program. It's just so difficult for me to let it go because this MA program was sold as a *cohort*\-based program so when my peers are unequipped for class or shallowly interact with guest lecturers or community partners, it directly impacts me. I've spoken with my professors about the varying levels of commitment and preparedness in my cohort, and I think I should arrange another conversation, but I don't even know what to say at this point because they are already well aware of the in-class dynamics. Do I directly address these issues with my peers? The biggest issue I have with doing that is the small size of my cohort, and I don't think that bringing up these issues would have the intended effect; it would probably serve to alienate me. Is this a common reality at the master’s level that I should’ve expected? I honestly thought that by this point students would be more committed, driven, and ready to engage at a deeper level. What do I do?

"I think no field is truly safe anymore except medicine. I'm pursuing my bachelor's degree in bioengineering right now, and to be honest, the more I think about it, the more it seems like this field and almost every other one has become very unstable. Everything seems so uncertain right now, from engineering to research. It's hard to feel safe about the future when there are layoffs, automation, AI taking over jobs, and not enough stable job opportunities. There is a lot of uncertainty in bioengineering, which is supposed to be a new and exciting field. There aren't many job openings, research positions are hard to get, and career paths aren't clear. When I think about medicine, it seems like that's the only field that's still somewhat safe. People will always need doctors. There is no technology that can really take the place of human judgment and care in medicine. I'm not saying that medicine is easy. It's a long, hard, and stressful path. But at least it feels safe and has very less layoffs and ups and downs.

"When to give a student a car. **Tl;Dr: Daughter wants a car. Mom thinks she would benefit from learning to depend on others. Daughter wants independence. What do?** I'll start by saying I'm very fortunate and grateful to be in the position I am to provide for my kids education 100% out of pocket. I did not go to college, but still ended up in a lucrative career which I've persisted with for almost 3 decades in various industries which has made me well rounded and useful to my employers. A heaping helping of benefitting from white privilege along the way. That said. My daughter is begging for a car. She's a freshman this year. She wants a car next year. I'm borderline ambivalent at the moment, leaning toward getting her one. maybe. She has an internship this summer, unpaid, will not need a car but it will give her valuable experience in her target industry and will be certain to land a paying job next summer. My daughter is mortally afraid of talking to other people and will do almost anything to avoid human interaction. Her dormmate moved out b/c she is a party girl and my daughter is boring and liked to go to bed early. My daughter attends most of her classes and is a solid B student. Does not party. Ever. Very responsible, if somewhat over-thinking individual, and perpetually anxious. My wife's argument against the car purchase amounts to the growth opportunity our daughter is experiencing having to rely on others. Something that moves her out of her comfort zone and forces her to interact with people. Build empathy, etc. My daughter's arguments for the car amount to being able to invite others to go places and do things instead of being a burden to others. Also, she got ill during the semester and while she didn't die, she called home after a severe allergic reaction where her throat had swollen tight and could barely breathe, asking mom for ideas on what to do about it without interacting with others. Basically, she seriously would risk death instead of being a burden to people. She claims if she had a car she would have sought medical help sooner. There's even odds that statement is true in my opinion. I know she's a nutjob, but that's what college is for. Learning how to press yourself into the world. Find your way, etc. We've told her to seek mental health with mixed results. She's seeing the school counselor irregularly about this and other phobias. that's not the point of this post.

"At what point would you call your institution corrupt. Started work at a new university this year and slowly I’ve come to question if the whole thing is a scam. It was innocuous stuff at first but then things get worse and worse. 1) during orientation we were told that they had not built faculty offices - that we were discouraged from meeting students outside the classroom. All while administrators had offices on campus so students would go complain to them 2) we were explicitly told to publish with SCOPUS so the university might improve their ranking. Only scopus publications counted towards your appraisal. And if you did publish in scopus they’d give you a cash reward. 3) it’s fairly clear that they want folks from the Ivy League/ Oxbridge schools to work here- so those folks are allowed to do anything at all. One guy I knew spent the entire year travelling the country. Barely on campus once a week. Got paid a lot more than most of us. 3) initially they said you have freedom to decide on the evaluation pattern for your students. But when students complain about points for class participation - the admin calls you in and tells you to do away with class participation. 4) when there are student complaints to admin - the uni doesn’t follow proper processes. Won’t show you the complaint or let you adduce evidence. They will call you in and simply yell at you about how you can’t teach. 5) there are no real admission standards if students can pay. There is an exam that you apparently have to take - but any score on the exam- even 5-10% is fine and they’ll admit you into a programme. 6) on my first day of work a student was waiting outside a classroom with me and she bragged to a friend that she didn’t bring a note book, that she didn’t need to because her father would make a call. When I addressed this in class and told them my integrity was not for sale - I was reprimanded by the dean. 7) it’s impossible for students to fail. They will get unlimited tries as long as they keep paying for the examination fees. 8) it’s actually beneficial for students to fail any course the first time around because the repeat papers will be half the work for twice the points. 9) university policy on plagiarism says to exclude all quotes. See if the percentage of plagiarism is more than 50%, if it is - only then report the student for plagiarism. 10) when instructors to a course agree to have a common closed book end semester test, the administration calls them in and makes them change it to an open book exam without allowing for time to change the question paper properly. They tell students they did it to alleviate mental pressures during exams. 11) a disability committee consists of other professors ( not specialists in disability) who approve accommodations for everyone who applies and gives them extensions. There is no link between the kind of disability and the accommodation- being wheel chair user will get you extra time on assignments as will having anxiety. 12) students and administrators will ask you to change course policy post hoc. Students did badly on a multiple choice test? Give them another test. Students did badly on presentations? Slot them into groups and award everyone the top score in the group. 13) professional regulations require 75% attendance policy- students here only have to be in class 65% of the time including all the medical leaves. 14) friend was asked to serve on a secret committee to alter grades and pass students during covid. 15) very important courses don’t teach the basics. Constitutional law class for example won’t teach the regional equivalent of brown v board of education. It’s too hard. 16) campus sexual assault is routinely unfounded. There is infact a “ Good Samaritan” squad that helps students get away with crimes. University has local police on the take. 17) little to no free speech. University doesn’t protect foreign faculty who might have said something about our authoritarian government. They are questioned on campus by police authorities without a lawyer by their side. Faculty from this country are threatened with their jobs lest they say anything political. 18) faculty who do use university events as examples in class are told to not speak about the university at all. We all sign NDAs. 19) the grade inflation is unseemly. 40% of our students will have a gpa of 7.2 or more on 8. They’re not all brilliant - we’re encourage to set easy exams and incentivised to grade leniently because our raises depend on student feedback. 20) one of the more recent high level administrators who was recruited came to us directly from the ratings organisation that put this university on the global map. With each of these instances I initially excused it because there was some pragmatic justification. But taken together it seems hard to believe this is not a fraud/scam/degree mill.

"Advice Needed: Tenure-Track Dilemma – Stay at R2 or Move to R1 with Uncertainty. Hi everyone, I’m currently a tenure-track assistant professor at an R2 university in the U.S., on track for tenure this summer. I hold several grants and enjoy mentoring students at current institution. That said, the institution has a very high teaching load paired with high research expectations, and it’s been extremely draining. It’s hard to find strong student collaborators, so I end up doing most of the research—including coding and writing—on my own. I’m increasingly overwhelmed and burned out. Now, I’ve received a tenure-track assistant professor offer (verbal) from an R1 university (with a three-year tenure clock). The environment is very appealing: low teaching load, strong research support, and a vibrant academic community. I’m genuinely excited about the opportunity to pursue more ambitious research goals. However, I’m struggling with several concerns: 1. Spousal hiring fell through due to ongoing budget issues. If I take the R1 offer, my spouse and I might need to live apart for years. 2. We’re expecting our first child this September, and I’m anxious about whether I can realistically balance new parenthood with the demands of starting over on the tenure track. 3. Federal research funding is tightening, and though I’ve had a satisfactory grant record (4 successful grants as PI or co-PI from NSF/NIH), I’m unsure whether I’ll be competitive in the current funding climate. I am worried about the potential fail for tenure at new institution. The final offer is still under review and may take another couple of weeks, so I have some time to think. But I’m torn. How would you approach this decision? What factors should I prioritize? And if I do accept the R1 offer, how can I best prepare myself and my family for the transition?

"advice for phd applicant with nsf grfp and no promising leads. **tl;dr: i went into this cycle with two years of funding from the nsf grfp, and it seems like my chances of getting into the phd programs i applied to this cycle are slim. would it be frowned upon to start reaching out to programs i didn't apply to and ask to submit a late application?** crossposting from r/gradadmissions because i would love opinions from people who have been on the other side of admissions committees. more context: i'm in a social sciences discipline, trying to study what the current administration would term ""dei nonsense"". currently im in a one-year master's program (culminating in a thesis, don't worry). this cycle is my second time applying to phd programs; i am using the first year of my grfp tenure to fund my master's education, and have two years of tenure remaining. for this year's application: i did mention the grfp in my application essays. the award is listed front and center on my cv. i uploaded the funding details and acceptance letter from the nsf to all my admissions portals. in my humble opinion, i've been quite clear that i am bringing this funding with me. if it matters at all, my undergrad gpa was 3.98, and my master's gpa is somewhere between an a and a- right now i'm aware it's a bit early to be panicking, but i don't want to be put in the same position as last year where pis are telling me they can't consider my application because the cycle has ended. i've had some sort of formal preliminary interview with pis for two of the seven programs i applied to, and one of these ended in a rejection. i would say four of the remaining programs are a bit prestigious, and i don't feel optimistic about my odds. this brings me to my question: would it come off as cocky or asking for unwarranted special treatment if i reach out to pis or grad admissions programs at schools i didn't apply to, asking if they could consider a late applicant? i don't want to be seen as arrogant just because i have some fancy award, but i would consider it a massive shame to give money back to the federal government right now when it *could* be going to something cooler",Fees,Medium,1.0,web:reddit:r/gradschool:new,Medium,1,2175,397,7,advice for phd applicant with nsf grfp and no promising leads.,0

Going back to school in your 30s to get a second Bachelors. i feel you on wanting a practical pivot after all that humanities work. at 35 youre definitely not too old for a switch. maybe start with some self paced intro courses to see if coding or finance actually clicks before committing to another degree. tbh something like python for everybody on coursera gives you a solid taste without the pressure. i'd also check out a [project management professional (pmp) prep course](https://metadoraffi-eng.github.io/shopit?search_keywords=pmp+prep+course) since your teaching and mfa background set you up well for leading teams and communicating complex stuff. tons of teachers move into instructional design or tech writing too and those paths dont always need a whole new bachelors,Faculty,Low,0.0,web:reddit:r/college:comments,Low,0,782,121,6,Going back to school in your 30s to get a second Bachelors.,0

"This is an automated service intended to preserve the original text of the post. *Hi! I recently wrote an academic dismissal appeal letter. I will cross out personal info, but I am hoping to get constructive criticism on it before I turn it in tomorrow Thank you lovely professors! cheers Dear Members of the Appeal Committee, I am writing to appeal my dismissal from the University ------ with the hopes of reinstatement for the Spring 2025 semester. While this decision was not a surprise, I am saddened that my academic performance turned out this way. In this appeal I hope to take full responsibility, explain the extenuating circumstances that resulted in these grades, and explain how, moving forward, I am capable of bringing my GPA into good academic standing. I thank you all for this opportunity. The past two semesters have been strenuous for both me and my mental health, leading to my academic performance being inadequate. As I was experiencing dangerous symptoms, my goal was always to pursue medical professionals for treatment. However, before I could, I was suddenly found not eligible for my health insurance anymore. Making affording medication and a psychiatrist impossible for me. Being on government health insurance, when I turned 19 I aged out. I then had to go through a very long and tedious process to be insured again. And in June of 2024, I succeeded. Before I was back to being insured, however, I experienced very dire symptoms that left untreated became progressively more serious. Additionally, my first semester at ---- was in the spring of 2024. Transferring halfway through the year unearthed a lot of isolation and made me feel so hopeless I felt like there was no help for me and I couldn’t do anything. My symptoms carried on getting worse until I was finally able to seek treatment. I pursued treatment through the University's health center the moment I could and got diagnoses and medication that improved my symptoms greatly. My medication and treatment took a while to settle and take effect of course. Although I began to improve my attendance and participation in my education when it did. However, it was too late in the semester for me to achieve my academic goals. The isolation I experienced during my first semester caused my mental health to drop to its lowest point. My symptoms, coupled with my own decisions caused the actions that led to my low GPA. Those actions included: episodes of panic multiple times a day to the point where I could not be stabilized, depressive episodes that resulted in not leaving my room for multiple days on end, missing ample amounts of classes, and anxiety-induced insomnia leading to a lack of motivation. I know I cannot go back and change these actions, but in the process of bettering myself, I have learned an incredible amount. For a while, I lacked the motivation to seek out any free resources while I was struggling with no health insurance. Looking back I now acknowledge that this caused not only my grades to suffer more, but also my mental health. That being said, I no longer struggle with this lack of motivation and have found myself with a newfound excitement towards life and my education. Through this, I have learned about many incredible resources at ---- that have helped me curate a plan for myself to continue a healthy mental state as well as reach good academic standing. To reach good academic standing it is my understanding if readmitted I must reach at least a 2.7 GPA. This GPA is similar to the one I received in high school, so I curated a plan similar to the one I enacted back then so I am familiar with how it impacts me as a student. For starters, I want to continue meeting with my psychiatrist every month and have a meeting scheduled for February 4th. In terms of therapy, I have been in contact with ----- Counseling LLC to place me with a specialist there hopefully sometime in the next month. If for some reason this proves to be too expensive, however, I plan to pursue treatment through cheaper online therapy on Better Help. To better my academic standing I have started talking to my academic advisor about a potential medical withdrawal. I have also switched my major from psychology to English. This major switch was due to many factors. I have found myself passionate in English classes and see clearer and more attainable career goals for myself through this major and love the department here at -----. As previously stated, my academic standing was caused by missing a lot of class time due to many factors. Although I no longer struggle with leaving my room, I believe it is important to have outside sources holding me accountable for my attendance as well. For starters, I plan to attend -------- tutoring sessions located in ----- Library on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 4 p.m. to stay on top of what I am learning in the classes I am attending. On Friday afternoons I also have plans to have study dates with my roommate at local cafes to have a fun way to keep the the two of us motivated. My roommate and I have also discussed carpooling to school to hold ourselves more accountable since we would be responsible for another person's attendance. To make sure my plan is working well for me and my grades, I plan to meet with both my academic advisor and a ------ ambassador every month. I want to schedule my first ----- peer listening session for January 29th at 4:00 p.m. In terms of my insurance, in the case that I am suddenly found ineligible again, I have a list of Federally Qualified Health Centers to reach out to if need be. And in the case, my medication stops working, I now have a support system of friends and family that was not previously present here for me at ----- when I first transferred. Additionally, I want to reach out to (My university's disability center) to inquire about any services I am eligible for. I hope that these resources I have mentioned will aid in my return to good academic standing. My academic standing is incredibly important to me, especially here at ----- which offers unique resources that I want to continue using. I want to state that although my academic standing was inadequate over this time frame, I am not a bad student and have the motivation and tools I did not previously achieve my goals. I have attached a letter from my psychiatrist recommending me for reinstatement as well as reciting the progress I have made. I have also attached proof of my insurance and when I was found eligible again. I thank you all for your time and understanding, I hope you consider this appeal and this letter of recommendation when making your decision.

"Advice for surviving all-nighter crunch time + ADHD with my sanity and grades intact. My situation: * Due to fall break, the schedule for this week is weird -I have Monday off entirely, and the classes that would be on Monday on Tuesday instead, and the rest of the week is normal. So I get comic class at noon two days in a row. * The deadline for a BIG ASSIGNMENT (two comic pages rough drafts) is due Wednesday by the start of class. This is sooner than I was expecting, so I have not started it -but I thankfully know exactly what I will draw. * The deadline for two smaller, but much more tedious, assignments, is Tuesday, one by the start of class and the other at midnight. Thankfully it's the former that's easier. * I have D&amp;D from 7-10 PM Sunday night, and cannot skip it because I have already skipped a previous session in that campaign for homework reasons. * I have a sleep disorder that, while absolute hell to manage, conveniently allows me to stay up and functional for lengths of time no normal person could manage. Unfortunately, it physically feels miserable to be awake for that long, so I only do this in emergencies -and this is an emergency, I think. * I am normally better at managing my schoolwork and my ADHD, but recently my ADHD suddenly got a whole lot worse for no reason and so my usual methods of managing it stopped being enough. That's why I'm in this situation in the first place, and why I'm resorting to such drastic measures. The Difficulty (ADHD) * Time blindness. If I'm focused, I can lose track of time very easily. I also tend to forget to eat regularly, which will hamper my productivity. * Understimulation/Boredom. If an assignment is tedious, I will struggle to work on it or make progress. I will also struggle if I get too bored, understimulated or frustrated, or go for too long without a break. I am also very easily distracted for that same reason. * Hyperfixation. The last few hyperfixations I had were at a normal enough level that I could function as a person. With my current hyperfixation, I got unlucky, and the fixation got so intense it completely consumed my every waking thought. At any point, I am in constant danger of being distracted by either Silksong, my Hollow Knight fanfiction doc, or Ao3. If I choose to entertain myself these ways, I *must* be careful to track time. My plan so far: * I plan to fix a sleep schedule screwup and buy myself more time to work by pulling an all-nighter on Sunday night. * I will also pull an all-nighter on Tuesday night, to buy myself time for the deadline, and because I can't afford to spin the sleep disorder roulette wheel when Wednesday's class is *really important*. * I will sleep normally on Monday night -I have never been awake for longer than two days, consecutively, and even with my general disregard for my own health, I know that pushing that limit is a *bad idea*. * I have two fidget toys, music *without ads*, and a sketchbook I can draw in, so understimulation can easily be managed. * My daytime weekday workspace (the library) has access to comfy chairs next to plugs, and as much coffee or sweet drinks as I need. There's a massage chair, and the atmosphere is calm enough that I can easily nap in the comfy chairs. If I nap to stave off exhaustion, it *has* to be here; if I sleep in my bed I will sleep for far longer than intended. * My nighttime and weekend workspace (my dorm's rec space) has a piano (for taking breaks and fulfilling ADHD needs), and both access to a very large desk (next to a plug) and access to a comfy chair (also next to a plug).

"Want to go for a Ph.D/MS-Ph.D, need to pick up GPA, can't afford Post-Bac/Non-Degree Courses. Hey guys! After a lot of thought and weighing the options, I've decided to go to graduate school for a Ph.D. Disclaimer: Please do not tell me about working instead or whether or not I need a Ph.D for career advancement. I've already thought about that and I'm past that point. Entirely. My field: Software Development. My B.S.: Mechanical Engineering with approximately 2.75 GPA. And no, most of the bad grades were not in the beginning. The last two years was around a 2.0~2.25 due to family/health problems. My Ph.D desired field: Computer Science and Software Engineering. I want to study machine learning and artificial intelligence. I'm willing to go for an M.S. first, but it'd have to be a funded program and I would still need some requisite courses. The other issue is that I'm kind of in between residencies. I'm originally from California, but now I live in Missouri and I've only been here working full-time for two months, so I'm not a Missouri resident but I have W2's from Tennessee and Missouri so I can't claim residency back home in California. If I could, I would go for a board waiver in California. My plan is: Take 4~5 requisite computer science courses either as a non-degree/community college student. Get straight A's in them and speak to the professors as much as possible and try to get them to take me on for some sort of project so I can get recommendation letters. While I take those courses, study for the GRE so I can have a solid foundation ready when I take it in the spring. But the problem is 4 classes would end up being about 16 credit hours and at $60-75 a unit, I'd be out about $1000 after fees.

Decided to **add** music performance and do an extra year. (5 years free) 5. Had a severe asthma attack and had to take a semester off cause I was in the hospital. Started experiencing stress hives and heart issues and dislocated my knee. Diagnosed with autoimmune disease and EDS. Decided to delay nursing another year. 6. Started teaching private music lessons. Kids and parents loved me. Nearby music school offered me $90/hr if I signed a non-competition order. **added music education** It'll take me 6 years to graduate. But I'll have a nursing, music performance, and music education degree and only 1 year of loans. So I think it's worth it.

"Asking my professor to do a group project solo. Im in a general chemistry course, and at the beginning of the semester there was a “creative” assignment and its description posted.

"In Research Methods classes, do you allow group projects? If so, how do you handle questions of fairness. I teach a class where students read past research to learn basic terms/concept, each propose and design a new research project, then code materials, recruit participants, and collect data. Then they write a full report and complete a presentation on the study. That part is fairly inflexible; most social science programs have something similar. What I'm on the fence about is allowing students to work in pairs/trios, or requiring them to work alone. * Allowing pairs/trios frees up a lot of bandwidth; I get paid for 3 credit hours for this class, but it can quickly become a 20+-hour-a-week commitment if there are 18 different projects. * It acknowledges that there are only so many study ideas out there, and it's common for two people to propose approximately the same hypothesis. However. * It raises lots of questions of fairness, since I require everyone to complete their reports and presentations independently, but material sharing still happens within groups. * It's also unfair because of how often one partner does &gt;80% of the work, and what a headache it is to prove that that's what happened. * The classic conundrum: not everyone has a friend in the class, and the hockey players who instantly pair off have an advantage over a dyad who's never met before. The version I teach now allows students to work alone or in small groups, as they choose. It was what my predecessor did, and it seems to be the worst of both worlds. One student basically bullied a friend into partnering with her and then doing most of the work (a situation I'm still trying to unfuck), three other students tried to stick completely different hypotheses together, and several singles are feeling cheated. I know about group contracts and confidential feedback; I use those already. But I'm trying to figure out how to square this circle, next time I teach this class. Put everyone in pairs? Require everyone to work alone? Allow people to choose, but split or meld pairs at my own discretion? One massive group project? Exactly six 3-person projects?

"Seeking feedback: having some legal difficulties with my Uni. I was working on a PhD at the University of New South Wales in Australia when I lost my supervisor. To make a very long story very short, the University said they could not find another supervisor and discontinued my candidature. Three years work down the drain. Full scholarship rescinded. I am an international student so my visa privileges also were rescinded. I decided to file a complaint. The complaint officer said I should talk to the University's ""Privacy Officer"" about obtaining some information from the uni through a formal request. He promptly leaked the details of my impending complaint to the administrators I was trying to complain about. That was round one. I won a legal battle against UNSW in the Civil Tribunal for breach of privacy. That much is a matter of public record. You can read the decision in legalese here: https://www.caselaw.nsw.gov.au/decision/5a581225e4b058596cbad962 or better still, read the newspaper article about it in plainer language here: http://honisoit.com/2018/01/unsw-found-to-have-breached-privacy-act/ The privacy matter is just the tip of the iceberg, but the lack of good faith mentioned in the article is something that the Uni has exhibited throughout the ordeal.

"How do you get letters of recommendation if you attended school online. Background context, because why not: I am wanting to apply to PhD programs, and believe (maybe naively) that I am probably of average competitiveness. I haven't done a ton of research in an academic setting other than my undergrad capstone, which let's be honest, wasn't peer reviewed or taken that seriously by my department, despite me getting a grade of 100% on it. I also don't have any formal publications. I had a 3.75 GPA in my undergrad and a 3.5 in my master's degree, but I have switched schools a few times because I just liked finding programs that really felt like a fit. In my defense, as a first gen college student I never expected originally to continue in school this far so I didn't really care about how it looked, but now that I want to continue I will admit that having a long list of schools attended doesn't look great on me. Since graduation, and even during, I have a pretty good deal of experience in my field, running one of the most successful (*if not THE most successful*) nonprofit in my industry for the past three years, and have given presentations and conferences all over the US as well as been a part of creating some pretty impressive research papers for submitting to the state for continued funding and grants. Prior to this, I also have 13 years of experience in pretty high positions relative to my field and am looking to go into a degree program that aligns with my professional work, which also for the most part aligns with my current degrees. **This all being said,** I got my undergrad during the pandemic and then did grad school online, so despite feeling pretty successful in my career, I have basically zero academic connections that could actually remember my work quality, and the ones I do have are from quite a while ago. Plus my schools are good, high quality, and reputable, but not ivy leagues by a long shot. I can get *AMAZING* references from my professional work, but obviously, that isn't what they are looking for. How bad is this going to look on me if my references are vague and/or old if submitted alongside professional references, and/or do any of you have recommendations on getting better references after studying online? PS. I know that the point of a PhD is research, and while I don't have as much experience in it, that is fully why I want to do it.

"This isn't quite correct. Many, if not most universities have non-discrimination statements that cover more categories than state or federal law and tend to have expanded coverage related to *perceived* characteristics, broad ""fairness of access""/ academic fairness and some flavor of inclusion provision even if in a state that is relatively hostile to DEI. You are answering this from the perspective of a dynamic where the student is like an employee and the professor is the employer, but the student is a customer and the professor is a mid-level employee, for all intents and purposes and universities are very scared about loss of revenue, law suits and negative PR. The student absolutely does not have the onus to prove the targeted surveillance was related to a federally-protected category. We are not just talking about discrimination in this context. There are also issues related to academic fairness and a lack of fair play on the university front does not necessarily need to be related to a federal protected class. There is also an argument that the professor engaged in harassment and bullying/intimidation, not just because of the impact on the student, but because it was viewable and done in front of other students and the TA and could impact rumors/social standing for the student. OP: Speak to other students who were in the exam and ask them if they observed/noticed this as well and ask if they will verify this to admin if necessary. Yoir peers will hopefully have your back. You can also email the professor and the TA who was asked to watch you specifically and ask them in writing to explain why you were closely observed. Get everything in writing that you can. OP, take this seriously, talk to the relevant Dean, director of student affairs, your academic advisor and student government. Do so simultaneously and don't wait for response from one before covering the issue with the others. If admin response is unimpressive, go to student publications. I'm saying this as someone who was in student government leadership and assisted several of my peers getting relatively similar matters taken seriously and resolved with college administration. This in no way needs to be a protected category issue in order to be handled robustly.

"Studying time for fundamentals. I just recently completed my preliminary exam which was in a paper review format where I was given a paper in my discipline and asked to review the work, contributions as applied to fundamental concepts. My feedback related to my presentation and report was that the review and discussion was good but I felt that I was lacking in understanding much of the fundamentals. My question is related to finding time to keep up with fundamentals in your field in an already more than full time job environment. Much of the topics covered were related to classes I have already completed (and done well in). Given unlimited time I think it would be useful to semi-regularily return to fundamental material and perhaps omelets practice problems from the relevant textbooks, however balancing research, current classes, and assistantship responsibilities makes this seem like an infeasible strategy. Additionally, my research is primarily experimental so many of the fundamental concepts aren't directly utilized in a day to day sense where I could develop and active and intuitive understanding at the present moment. Many of the past concepts I believe would come back to me after a day or so of self study but that time is not always available.

"I think I’m accidentally becoming the “always available” lab person and I don’t know how to stop. Hi everyone, I’m a 2nd year PhD student in a STEM-ish lab (biomed adjacent) at a big state university. Overall I like my project and my PI isn’t a monster or anything, but lately I’ve realized I’m slowly turning into the person everyone pings for random stuff, and it’s starting to mess with my actual progress. It started out nice, like I wanted to be helpful and also I was new so I thought saying yes was how you prove you belong. Now it’s like: can you show the new rotation student how to run the instrument, can you “just” check the cell culture while I’m out, can you update the shared protocol doc, can you cover lab meeting becuase I’m traveling, can you troubleshoot the software on the microscope. None of these things are huge alone, but they stack up and they’re always time sensitive so my own work gets pushed to nights or weekends. I also feel weird complaining because some of it is normal lab citizenship, and I genuinely don’t mind helping people learn. The problem is that it’s not evenly distributed and I can see it happening in real time: people come to me first because I respond fast, and then I respond fast because I don’t want to be seen as difficult. I’ve tried giving soft no’s like “I can later this week” or “I’m slammed today” but that just turns into “ok when are you free” and then I’m negotiating my calendar with someone else’s emergency. My PI tends to assume we’ll all figure it out, so I don’t think they’re noticing that I’m doing a bunch of invisible work, and I’m nervous that bringing it up will sound petty or like I’m not a team player. At the same time, I’m behind on writing and my experiments are taking longer because I keep switching contexts, and I’m noticing I’m more anxious even when I’m not in the lab. Is there a normal way to set boundaries here without turning the lab vibe into something tense? Like do people literally start saying “I’m not available for that” and leave it at that, or do you give a reason every time. Would it be smarter to talk to my PI about roles so it’s more explicit, or is that overkill and I should just fix my own habits? I don’t want to stop being helpful, I just don’t want to be the default help desk for everyone forever.

"Parents not letting me dorm? ( Hit or miss). Hi Y'all, basically my parents are not letting me dorm in college and want me to stay off-campus in a apartment alone or possibly with my dad. I live more than 2500 miles away from the university and it is basically in the middle of nowhere. Intially, when I spoke to my parents about this, they said if worst comes to worst, you would stay in a dorm but in a single room ( I am completely fine with this). The issue is that the school that I got accepted to ""Requires"" all students to stay on campus for the first year unless you live close/have family. Since I was unsure of attending this university, my parents said do not sign up for housing because they can bill you the fees if you don't show up.My parents believe the dorms are ridiculous due to their bad experiences more than 20 years ago. They have witnessed drugs, alcohol and sex in the corridor and believe I'd be distracted by that and will affect my studies. My parents also told me that staying off campus is much cheaper than staying on a dorm, which is 100% true. My parents believe staying in a dorm is really expensive (20,000) just for room and board.I completely understand my parents concerns but getting a single room and living on campus is completely easier for me than staying off-campus and commuting to class. I also spoke to my parents about not being able to meet fellow freshmen, being social and etc but they told me ""are you going to college to meet friends or to study"". I don't wanna go on tinder and find people lmao, I'd rather meet people face to face on campus than be alone in a apartment. Another concern is that my father will be living with me in a apartment. My father works from home and would basically move 2500 miles with me just for university is a bit unreasonable. I will not have the opportunity to go out to gatherings, concerts or any of that sort due to my dad's views. I do see the fact that having a parent with you on campus makes it easier for a young adult to have someone protect and council them at all times but I would say, I would need my own personal space. I do know that staying in apartment means you don't have to deal with dorm issues and any of that sort. Whereas, I'd miss out on making friends and basically being a loner in college.

"Ideas for deterring AI use in online classes. I know others have posted on this, but I'm still seeking ideas. I teach online a lot because my university encourages it. I've managed to minimize AI use with a handful of assignments in one class: I require them to do oral history interviews and submit recordings; I have them do weekly check-ins as video notes and tell them they can't just read those;multiple choice quizzes are open-book w/links to online reading built into the quiz in hopes this will get them to look at the reading at least once; they have to find articles in old newspapers and write about them. Their final papers have to synthesize information from the interviews and newspaper articles. But in other classes, it's much harder to figure out what to do.

"What are my options if my advisor prevents me from graduating. I'm a Master's student (thesis track) currently in my 6th semester (3rd year). I was supposed to graduate last semester but delayed to this semester to give me more time to process data and perform analyses. My progress has been significantly slowed by unforeseen analytical issues, but mostly my advisor has been incredibly distant. I'm not looking for validation on that front - I've already had multiple discussions with my department's administration (including the chair) about my experiences, and they've all been appalled at how I've been treated. For the rest of the post, please keep that in mind. I have 90% of my first chapter written, but my advisor is now floating the idea of me graduating in the summer or fall instead of this spring. They are concerned they may not have enough time to review my drafts before I defend in mid-April. They do not have any more funding for me, so they'd force me to pay my university's fees to stay a student while I finish up. However, I already have a job lined up that does not care about my degree, and I care way more about the work I'm doing with them than I care about my Master's. If I do not graduate this semester, that job immediately takes priority for me. I already plan on being very open about how my priorities will shift. So, what are my options if my advisor wants to delay my defense? 1. I could go along with the delay and put the bare minimum into finishing up. This would cost me roughly $1,000 per semester. I am not a fan of this option. 2. I could attempt to force them to let me defend and graduate by threatening to quit altogether. I am my PI's first student, and two other students have already quit on top of misuse of university funds. If I leave, my PI will likely have to wait another 2.5 years for a student to graduate and produce any papers. That's 6 years of being a tenure-track professor with no students graduated or publications or presentations from their work. My advisor is incredibly vulnerable. 3. I could switch advisors and go with a non-thesis track degree. This would likely forfeit any publications with my current advisor or our collaborators. My entire thesis is based on a collaboration with a government agency, and our partner at that agency is on my committee. That committee member has been incredibly supportive and understanding, but I doubt I could publish with just them with our data. This option would also still result in a major delay in my graduation. 4. I could quit altogether. I am incredibly frustrated at the moment and thinking somewhat irrationally, but I feel like I am being abused.

"college subpoena for student reddit data. My son attends Montclair State University in NJ. He recently had some issues with one of his professors, borderline sexual harassment. My son is a sweet kid and doesn't want to report it as it was ""only"" flirtation and inappropriate non-school-related invitations to hang out with the professor and his boyfriend. My son was very uncomfortable but he kept telling me ""maybe \[the professor\] is just trying to be inclusive."" My son is gay and doesn't think a popular gay professor could possibly be a predator. I disagree but I agreed to let my son handle it his own way, he is a Junior in college after all. My son posted some stuff on Reddit and on the school ""confessions"" page on instagram. Well apparently someone figured out my son's identity--the professor was on the instagram page denying everything, and then my son started getting anonymous texts that he thinks are coming from the professor's boyfriend. The final straw is that yesterday my son got an email from Reddit Legal Support that said: &gt; The subpoena was initiated by a Detective Lieutenant from the Montclair State University Police Department and says: &gt; I am just in shock. In my college days we would have staged a student walk-out and protested til the cows came home if the college tried to dig into our personal accounts. I guess this is legal because it was approved by a judge in the Superior Court of NJ, but it is completely reprehensible. I don't know how Reddit will respond. And in case anyone is wondering, I have looked over all of my son's Reddit posts. They are plain vanilla and the only thing that could be of any interest to the University Police is a post saying ""here is what my professor is doing, do you guys think it's ok?""

"If her gender is changed on her birth certificate and that's what will be on her school account, then she at least shouldn't have any trouble getting a female dorm with a female roommate. And, you also aren't obligated to disclose anything, because whatever is in her pants is her business. She's a girl, she's recognized as a girl on paper and in society, she should not have to say anything otherwise. However, there is *always* going to be the potential that she gets a transphobic roommate, and while that would be a very good reason to request to switch rooms, if it happened, that would also mean she would have to disclose to housing that she's trans in order to switch, and also may have to spend some time still stuck with the transphobic roommate before they can find another spot for her. I'm a trans man and I haven't lived on campus or anything since long before I came out, but I stay in all-male dorms in hostels, for example. It's terrifying because I never know if any of the strangers there will be transphobic, or will want to sexually assault me because of what I have in my pants. But I keep it hidden and don't disclose a thing because, well, I want to continue being seen as a man. I change my clothes in the bathroom and do whatever I can to prevent them seeing my body. If your daughter doesn't want to disclose anything to anyone, my best suggestion would be simply to try her best to change her clothes in the bathroom, and if she's got estrogren with her, maybe to keep it in a safe spot where her roommate can't see it and/or take it only when the roommate is out, or bring it with her to the bathroom too.

"Over 1900 research fellows sign an Open Letter to expel Elon Musk from the Royal Society. Edit: 15 Feb 2025: Over 2450 Fellows and scientific researchers have signed so far. I've included the Open Letter written by Professor Emeritus Stephen Curry below. As far as I am aware, no fellow has been expelled from the Royal Society in 150 years. Any thoughts? 11 Feb 2025 Dear President Smith, I write to express my dismay at the continued silence and apparent inaction from the Royal Society over the Fellowship awarded in 2018 to Elon Musk. The Society was made aware of Fellows’ concerns over six months ago about how Musk’s behaviour was in contravention of your [Code of Conduct](https://royalsociety.org/-/media/about-us/how-we-are-governed/code-of-conduct.pdf). Clear instances of this, such as his promotion of unfounded conspiracy theories and his malicious accusations towards Anthony Fauci were highlighted in Professor Dorothy Bishop’s [resignation statement](https://deevybee.blogspot.com/2024/11/why-i-have-resigned-from-royal-society.html). To that we can now add his [post on X (Twitter)](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn7r0pzz57vo) about the Rt Hon Jess Philips MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Safeguarding and Violence Against Women and Girls, falsely accusing her of being a “rape genocide apologist” who should be jailed, an utterance that placed her in physical danger. I am at a loss to understand how these actions are consistent with a code of conduct that requires Fellows to have “due regard for the statement of values developed from time to time by Society”, (values that ask Fellows to “act in accordance with the highest standards of public life”, to make a “positive impact”, to “strive for excellence.”). The Royal Society, as our national science academy, holds a unique and leading position within the UK scientific community, a position that in the Society’s own words “rests upon the reputation of the Fellows and Foreign Members of which the Society is composed”. That reputation has been grievously undermined by the public statements of Mr Musk. The situation is rendered more serious because Mr Musk now occupies a position within a Trump administration in the USA that has over the past several weeks engaged in an assault on scientific research in the US that has fallen foul of federal courts. It has sought to impose huge cuts in funding and a regime of censorship (particularly with regard to EDI and climate issues) that is a direct threat to freedom of expression and academic freedom. According to your code of conduct, “Fellows and Foreign Members shall not act or fail to act in any way which would undermine the Society’s mission or bring the Society into disrepute.” Yet not one word of protest has been uttered by Mr Musk over actions that contradict the values the Society demands of its Fellows and that have caused widespread fear and concern within the scientific community in the States. This is a moment in which leaders and leading institutions need to take a stand. So far, the Royal Society has hidden behind the mantra that “Any issues raised in respect of individual fellows are dealt with in strict confidence.” I understand the need for confidentiality in cases of complaint, but the lack of any other statement in this very public instance, or recognition of its wider implications, increasingly looks like a failure of moral courage. What message does it send about the Society’s commitment to upholding its code, its values and its [declarations about the importance of diversity and inclusion](https://royalsociety.org/about-us/who-we-are/diversity-inclusion/)? What message of support does it send to our friends and colleagues in the USA, especially women, people from ethnic minorities, and disabled and LGBT researchers who are most exposed to the Trump-led offensive that has recruited Elon Musk FRS as its most enthusiastic general? I urge you, for the sake of decency and to offer hope in what are very troubling times, to demonstrate that the Royal Society has the courage to stand up for the scientific community and for the values that it claims to believe in.

"IFIN-HH in Bucharest, Romania, CERN and the UK: Ghostwriting Student Assignments. Long time ago I reported being asked by someone while being employed at the IFIN-HH in Bucharest Romania, to ghostwrite a student assignment for a student in the UK in exchange for a sum of money. The initial post can be found here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/o4tuxt/hired\_as\_rentaphd/](https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/o4tuxt/hired_as_rentaphd/) &amp;#x200B; After many years, a lot of it involving all sorts of harassment from the Romanian police, it just so happens that some guy at CERN answered the complaint and started to fish for information, asking me to give him the name of the person that extended the offer in the first place. The entire conversation with him follows. -------------------:[ 6 ] Dear Mr. Lüders &gt; Thank you for your many words. Well, I considered that the dumbed down version would be more suitable to people either sincere enough to admit that such incidents with the IFIN-HH are widely known, so I decided to write a longer version to make my stance clear on the matter, even for those that would not match that target audience. &gt; Given that I do not have any initial evidence to act on (as your screenshot masks the perpetrator's name), there is little I can follow up on. No. You do have evidence to act upon, just that you do not have the name of the person extending the request. Whatever you would do, would have to go through your own channels and please be aware that I am in no way obliged to spoon feed you information. The suspicion alone should be a sufficient motive. &gt; I will raise your issue with the appropriate body but, given that this is then an internal affair, there shall be no obligation to share any result of that. I shall do so as well then and you are partially right, but. CERN absorbs tax payer money and is a public institution funded by several countries and you will be obliged to share any such result with any financiers with the press being the default case. Even trivially, given that a student in Bournemouth was accosted by someone at CERN, this case exceeds any locality to CERN, unless you think that CERN/Switzerland has annexed Bournemouth from the United Kingdom and is considering cross-continental affairs as ""internal""? Even with my bad sense of geography, I think the United Kingdom would be interested in such cases. My own interests only extend so far as the downward slope after refusing such ""offers that cannot be refused"" from staff at CERN can be explained. Otherwise, as detailed earlier, your late response, and asking me for stuff when you have all the necessary tools at your disposal, already clarified what you are about, to me, on a personal level. I hope you will not also send a van around to break my shins? Best regards,. -------------------:[ 5 ] Dear. Thank you for your many words. Given that I do not have any initial evidence to act on (as your screenshot masks the perpetrator's name), there is little I can follow up on. I will raise your issue with the appropriate body but, given that this is then an internal affair, there shall be no obligation to share any result of that. Yours S&gt;&gt;L Dr. Stefan Lüders CERN Computer Security Officer &amp; Head of Computer Security European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) Phone +41 75 411 0207 -------------------:[ 4 ] Dear Mr. Lüders, I would like to make you aware that this issue has been raised very early on and even with the LHCb/GRID staff at C.E.R.N. If you are surprised that ""this dates back to January 2020"" then it is the fault of the people at C.E.R.N. whom I have notified years ago that, as it now appears, chose to remain silent thereby covering up the matter. Needless to say, that this case is not the pinnacle of bad reputation that the IFIN-HH nor the DFCTI carries, with the heads knowing fully well what goes on and, to my experience, avidly participating. I also know that there are shared interests between C.E.R.N. and the IFIN-HH such that I would not really expect too much from an internal investigation given the glaring conflict of interest. However, if you are in any way newly employed at C.E.R.N. and do not know much about Romania, or the IFIN-HH, nor the DFCTI, then I am sorry for you given the task ahead of you (and that's not sarcasm). Otherwise, your request for me to ""help"" you figure out something that I am not obliged to in any way (whether as a job description, or even being in any way ethically inclined) seems very pretentious and in many ways insulting. I am sure that you would have plenty of resources at your disposal, given your title, position and reputation to carry out your own investigations, if that is what your job description encompasses. Romania is a highly corrupt place (on par with Cuba, in official statistics) with non-existent work ethics such that refusing to partake in criminal activities might land you out of a job. Even so, I have been asked by a department head to spy on some of my colleagues (the department head wanted them fired so he wanted me to collect data on them) and needless to say that refusing to spy did not exactly land me in the department's good graces. I do not think I will change that stance, and in particular because it is my impression that the problems at the IFIN-HH and the DFCTI do not consist in a case of a few bad apples, but rather in the fact that these cases involving corruption and/or fraud are the norm at the IFIN-HH. Irrespective of the former, the questions in my previous E-Mail still stand, and I will keep on asking periodically until a proper resolution has been met. I am looking forward to your investigation, I hope everything goes well and, when you reach a conclusion, please offer an official stance that C.E.R.N. takes regarding what you might have uncovered. I have been talking to people about this case, and others, such that I suppose it would be nice for them to also find out what happened in the end. Also, please be aware that the DFCTI and the IFIN-HH has made attempts to silence me on these matters, but it did not work too well for them and with a solid case built against them, regarding the illicit interception of E-Mails, involving the head of the DFCTI, his wife that does not even work within the same department as well as Mr. Ionel Andrei at ELI-NP. Thank you,. -------------------:[ 3 ] Dear., Given that this is your ""very intimate and personal opinion"", I leave you with that. Yours S&gt;&gt;L *Dr. Stefan Lüders* CERN Computer Security Officer &amp; Head of Computer Security European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) Phone +41 75 411 0207 -------------------:[ 2 ] Dear Mr. Lüders, Thank you for your E-Mail. Right now, it is my very intimate and personal opinion that the IFIN-HH should be deconstructed and instead we should rebuild the place as a giant saloon so that cool people such as myself can tan their balls. Sincerely,. -------------------:[ 1 ] Dear. Thank you very much for your email. I am sorry for the delay as this did not initially reach the right persons. I would like to investigate deeper into the issues you raise. However, for this I would need the full (unmasked) email address you received this communication from. Also, given that this dates back to Jan 2020, there is a chance that our logs have already been purged from any relevant information making any investigation complicated (or impossible). Would it nevertheless be possible to get the full email address? Yours, Dr. Stefan Lüders CERN Computer Security Officer &amp; Head of Computer Security European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) Phone +41 75 411 0207 One thing that I find worrying is that he mentions that ""there is a chance"" that their logs have been purged, but as per EU regulations, the logs have to be purged every 30 days. My impression is that this guy knows already who it is and just wants me to spell it out for him, which, is something that I obviously would not do and in particular because this event was not the one and only that took place at IFIN-HH. It is a much more generalized problem than a witchunt of sorts which is what this guy seems to want to go for. Even so, they should contact the director of the department and ask them how they let this slide, not ask me for details. There is also a dose of creepiness, making me believe that this guy spent too much time with his Romanian colleagues, in particular because he keeps referring to the event as some ""internal affair"", when, in reality, it involves three countries, Romanian, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, plus two separate research institutes and one University. The mental gymnastics to frame this event as anything ""internal"" is way too much for me. This guy is also under the impression that he does not owe any explanation to anyone, again, justifying it as some sort of ""internal"" thing where nobody else was involved, etc, but without even bothering, to say, contact the University in the UK and let them know that their students are being groomed over the Internet. During the last exchange, he adds some of his legal staff to the E-Mail, so I also add [nca.gov.uk](https://nca.gov.uk) to the E-mail to match. Since then, neither him nor his buddy have written back, so I guess that their little gamble that somehow this would be kept under the covers did not pan out that well, especially when I added an investigative institution to the E-Mail CC.

"Well young man. I'm going to give you a bit of advice. Always wear a condom. Even if she tells you she is on birth control. Your whole plan goes in the dumpster if you ever make that mistake. Many people are living paycheck to paycheck. Just barely making it. They can't save. A random health problem can cost them their whole savings. I'm a (resident) doctor. I work with an underprivileged population. I see it every day. I talked to a man a few months ago that had 2 heart attacks. He needed to see a cardiologist. He said he couldn't it was too expensive. I told him to sell his car. Move to a worse place if you need to. But you have to see cardio and pay the fees and medicine. Not very many people survive their 3rd heart attack. He had a family to support. He didn't want his kids living with roaches. His wife and kids taking the bus. He ended up dying. Family bread winner was general labor construction. Now he is gone. Family is destitute. You see one health problem can knock you out. Rob you of your savings. Don't know if you were old enough to watch breaking bad but not everyone is as smart as Walter white. You need to pick your health over your quality of life sometimes. You can literally die and everyone depending on you is then destitute. I might have detracted a bit, but I'm saying most folks can't do this. They're just getting by. A college education at least lands you entry level white collar work that pays OK and isn't labor intensive or dangerous. You see our society has shifted to an educated one. You need to be educated for regular jobs even an uneducated person could 100% do. You know you need a degree to work at fucking enterprise rent a car? If you have all the support to live at home with your parents and save power to you. You're very lucky and wise to save. Most folks don't have that. They are scraping by. It also doesn't help that if you want to have a family one day, your dating pool is severely restricted if you don't have a degree. Women are getting more and more educated and are statistically refusing to ""date down"" on education. You could be a successful plumber making more than that guy with an English degree who is an office manager. But you're crossed out of a lot of educated women's dating pool since you didn't get a degree. That's another aspect you gotta consider. I'm sure if you don't make a mistake with this mindset you have you will be successful young man. Just remember many people don't have the support you have or the ability to save like you do because every dollar goes to bills and food. Good luck young man. I believe in you.

"Can I ask professor to put me in a different small group. I am a graduate student. Last semester, I taught (instructor of record) a class that had ""Sara"" in it. Sara was not a great student, and her final project was not only incomplete, it had portions directly copied from online sources. Due to the nature of my humanities field, it would have been kind of hard (although not impossible) to prove that she had plagiarized. I felt it wasn't worth reporting and dealing with proving it, so I just gave her a 0. She failed the project but passed the class with a low C and never contacted me about her failed final (probably because she didn't care since she passed or she knew I knew she had copied). Now, I just logged into the LMS for an online class I am taking this semester. It has 45 people and the professor has broken us up into groups of 5 based on alphabetical order. Sara and my last name fall near each other so it looks like we are in the same small group. I do not want to be in a group with her. Not only is it incredibly awkward (since last semester I was her instructor), but also she just seems like she'd be a bad group work partner (based on my knowledge of her as a student). Is it appropriate for me to ask the professor to be moved to a different small group? I never formally accused Sara of anything so I cannot bring that up.

"Should I further talk to my professor. Just for some background: I'm in community college right now and I'm retaking a class that I took last year but didn't pass due because I didn't put in the required effort. The class is Calc 1 and I'm taking it honors because I wanted the extra rigor. I originally took it honors with the same professor last year too, and I decided to retake it honors with the same professor because he's an extremely smart professor and I like that his class is rigorous, but also because I wanted to show him that I'd be willing to work hard and do well in the class. In the past 3 weeks, I had missed two classes due to being sick and texted my friend asking for the notes. Last class, when the class ends, he tells me specifically to stay after class. I was wondering what he would say and I thought that he was going to tell me that I need to stay on top of my homework(the homework assignments are ""due"" by each test but the page to submit them stays open until the end of the semester. I hadn't submitted any assignments yet, but I had made plans to catch up on them so far). When everyone leaves, he instead gets angry at me that I left the class to go to the bathroom, saying that this is an honors class and that it's really disrespectful to leave the class while he's lecturing. For context, in this semester AND the entirety of the semester last fall that I took his class, I and many other people would regularly get up and go to the bathroom and come back and he never said anything about it to anyone. And that day in class, I was gone from the class for 45 seconds tops to go to the bathroom. I told him I didn't mean any disrespect and that I didn't know it was disrespectful because he'd never mentioned it before, but he remained angry and told me it was really disrespectful. I honestly don't get why he was angry at that, it confused me so much. He was still angry at me and told me that I'm not treating this class seriously as an honors class by skipping class and showing up late(I had somewhat of a problem at the start of the semester of showing up late that I'd talked to him about, but I had greatly improved upon it and was actually early to class that day). I told him that I wasn't skipping class for no reason and woke up really sick the class before and that I don't want to miss this class, but he didn't care and kept saying I shouldn't skip class. Repeatedly that day(before and after he talked with me) he made comments about how I shouldn't skip class even though I had made it clear to him that it was because I was sick. I had only missed two classes the entire semester, and the syllabus says that the professor can only drop you if you have more than three(and that policy is almost never followed). He then accused me of playing on my phone that class and doing nothing instead of doing my work. I was surprised because I wasn't playing on my phone, instead, for part of the class when we were supposed to independently work on practice problems, I was reading on it how to do the concept that we had to do in the problem. I had to read it because I didn't learn the concept due to missing the last class. I got out my phone to show him and I started explaining, but he cuts me off by repeatedly saying ""I don't care"" when I try to explain myself. I honestly don't understand, he says that I was doing nothing instead of working on the problem, but the whole reason I was on my phone in the first place was to learn how to do the problem so I wouldn't do nothing. I don't get why he was behaving this way. When I tried explaining myself, he would just repeat that what I was doing was bad, and I was honestly a pushover and just said okay and accepted it. He was talking as if he just wanted to accuse me, but when I tried explaining myself, it's like he wouldn't listen. Thinking about it now, the way he talked with me was disrespectful and didn't make sense and I was just a pushover. It made me so angry thinking about it yesterday and this morning. I had a lot of respect for this professor, but now I'm honestly demotivated to do the homework for the class. Should I try talking to the professor and further explain myself? Another thing is that he decides the curve the students get at the end of the class, and if he still feels that way about me by the end of the class, I'm guessing I won't get a generous curve. Tldr: Professor that I've known for a while gets mad at me for things that (to me) seem unreasonable, which seems out of character to me. I try explaining myself to him, but he doesn't seem interested in hearing it, so I just accept what he's saying. I don't know if I should talk to him about it further or not. Edit: Multiple people are saying that if I talk to him further, I should apologize. I don't understand why, could somebody explain? I already accepted the criticisms that he made of me even though some of the things he said were unreasonable, and on top of that, he was acting very disrespectfully.

"What's your practical approach to dealing with online accessibility with a week's notice. Has your administration made any official ruling on how to deal with accessibility requirements for the upcoming online apocalypse? I've been doing semi-online teaching longer than most of my colleagues. I'm no stranger to the accessibility requirements. I have a feeling that 90% of my coworkers have no idea that federal law requires their online content to be proactively accessible or understand what that means. My understanding of the standard is that any pre-recorded content needs to be closed captioned with 99% accuracy, and any live-streamed content needs to be closed captioned with 95% accuracy (i.e. Zoom). This is a requirement for all online content that has an audio component. Simply put: there is no way to achieve this for every class taught by every university that is closing. The faculty certainly don't have the time (or in many cases the technical training) to provide accurate captions. If you pay a human service to caption for $1/min and the average class generates 180 minutes of content per week, then we're looking at $1,260 per class for the seven weeks between now and the end of April. Does your department have ~$30,000 laying around for emergency closed captioning fees? Mine sure doesn't. Do the captioning services have the elastic manpower to handle a 100x increase in demand? I doubt it. I think in practice virtually all of us are going to ignore the requirement and hope it doesn't cause a problem. If I knew I was going to be held to strict compliance with accessibility I think the best I could do for my students is to do written online course notes and assign them extra reading. No recorded lectures, no teleconferences with more than one student at a time. Realistically strict adherence to the accessibility requirement would be doing more harm than good at this point. Rather than proactively requiring stringent accessibility for all online content I think a reasonable common sense requirement would be to only require accessibility that is commensurate with what would have been happening otherwise. I can stand in front of a class and mumble all day and it's 100% legal, but the moment I record that and put it on a website I'm risking lawsuits. If the student has a hearing impairment then surely they've already got some mechanism for dealing with that in class (even up to having a sign language translator, ala the ADA), so why can't they just keep doing that for recorded audio? Ultimately an online class isn't the same as a business meeting or a training video. Students are paying for access to us- if they mishear something on a video they can send us an email the same they could raise their hand in class. That became something of a rant, but I'm done now. What's your actual practical approach to addressing online accessibility in the next two months? This link from the CDC interprets the Rehabilitation Act as requiring online meetings (i.e. Zoom) as requiring captioning at the 95% accuracy level: https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/hearingloss/transcripts/Making-Meetings-Accessible.pdf This link from the EPA names teleconferences and webinars as needing to be accessible, but doesn't describe what that means specifically: https://www.epa.gov/accessibility/frequent-questions-about-section-508",Faculty,Medium,1.0,web:pullpush:r/Professors:submission:fee,Medium,1,3348,539,6,What's your practical approach to dealing with online accessibility with a week's notice.,0

"I think one of my classmates is trying to sabotage me/other students. I'm in a small major so I'm mostly with the same people in my classes. We have this one student who is a huge brown noser and kiss ass. It's super cringe. One time, someone ran slightly into her presentation slot and she flipped out, complained to the professor and sent people mean messages, even though it was all fine apart from her not getting time for many questions (the professor was chill about it and the presentation wasn't for a grade). Anyway, recently, I had to give my own presentation for a class. The professor asked me to present on a book of which there was one copy in the library. I requested it in a timely manner (I was assigned the book in October and the presentation wasn't until December, so I requested it in late October/early November). The book was unavailable but it was so specific that I knew it had to have been taken out by someone in our major. I asked around repeatedly, but everyone apologized (this girl read my messages but stayed silent). I luckily found a low quality PDF and was able to give the presentation. She was yawning and putting her head on the table throughout like she had somewhere else to be, which I thought was super rude, but I ignored it. Two weeks later, she came up to me at a social event, all giggly. She said 'omg can you believe I had your book, I'm soooooo ditzy, whoops'. She didn't even apologize and it was just annoying to hear that after the event. I just shrugged and said well, it's done now, and went back to my friends.

"The residency requirements for any school are clearly laid out — as a matter of law — and can be easily found by googling “IU Bloomington in-state residency requirements” or similar.

"Unfortunately, I cannot speak to what might make you more competitive for a neuroscience program, specifically, because that is not my area of expertise. However, if research is something you feel like you want to do, talk to your professors and see if they have any research they think you might be able to help with. This may take the form of compiling literature, collecting some data, writing a literature review at first but those are crucial steps in the research process. This can also potentially lead to some early publication authorship which will help your competitiveness. However, I can speak to academic track record and some other things. I totally failed at my first attempt at college, I am a first-generation college student and went through PhD. When I say I failed, I mean my first semester in undergrad I earned a 0.0 GPA. Having a less than stellar track record is not necessarily a problem so long as you get it together and demonstrate a good amount of progress. As for being ""exceptional"" very few people who earn a PhD are above average intelligence, that isn't necessarily what matters, also IQ isn't a static attribute per its creator, Alfred Binet. There are plenty of incompetent PhDs and MDs out there. Read widely, and read a lot. That's one of the key ways to develop expertise in your chosen field. Reading academic journal articles will also help expose you to different types of research design and statistical methodology. Regarding, writing, presenting, and public speaking, those skills like any others take practice to better develop. Take opportunities to practice them when they appear. Most people aren't born with an inmate talent for them. So, ask for feedback, which may be harsh at times, but reflect on it, think about what you feel is legitimate, and integrate it into your repertoire as needed. Sadly, anxiety tends to be part and parcel for many students at any level. Some of this stems from the nature of college and graduate school and some comes from seeing contemporaries being successful. The latter can be difficult to overcome but remember: comparison is the their of joy. What someone else is doing/achieving is not an indictment on you or your ability. Further, finding ways to cope/deal with your anxiety and stress will be incredibly important, not just in school but life in general. Now, as for what you will do during graduate studies. This largely depends on where you go. For example, US graduate programs tend to have coursework for the first couple years whereas many European countries do not. I cannot really speak to European masters/PhD programs because I have no experience with them beyond the above comment. In the US, you would have one or two theory courses, at least one research design course, and at least one course in statistics. There are generally other courses that you can choose from which are usually chosen through what might interest you out of what is being offered. Additionally, most PhD programs have some form of comprehensive exam(s) that cover things like theory, research design and statistics (depending on your field). This is done to make sure that those who go through the program have learned at least the bare minimum of what they should have, at least in the US. The development of your expertise is largely going to be left up to you to be self-motivated to read and expand that knowledge. Of course, you would likely have a faculty member as a ""mentor""and can help provide some guidance but part of college and especially graduate school is developing the skills to learn independently.

"Mentioning ADHD in letter of intent. Context : I will soon be applying to the top MSc Finance programs (pre-experience) in Europe and the UK. I am currently in my final year of Economics BSc in a swiss university. My CGPA is currently just below 5 (out of 6), or just below a 2:1. I hope with the semester exams in January, that I will be able to bring my CGPA exactly a 5/6. My current CGPA is quite average because I didn't do well in my first semesters of my bachelor's because I lacked treatment. Once I was diagnosed and got treatment, I was able to bring up my CGPA considerably. Question: So should I mention that my average-ish borderline CGPA of (below) 5/6 is partly due to my lack of treatment, and that I have been able to bring up my CGPA noticeably and also score well on the GRE exam showing an upward trend and motivation?

"John Oliver is correct about NIH grants. If your institution has a 40% indirect cost rate, you might get 100k in direct costs which are specific only to that project. So supplies for that exact project, staff time for that exact project. And the investigator calculates out all the exact project costs very carefully (you might even play portions of people’s salaries for instance - if they will only spent 10% time on a given grant they can only get 10% salary from it). So the direct costs are the ones the investigator spends on the project. The indirect costs, which come on top of that, are spent by the institution and in this scenario would be an additional 40K that comes in that the investigator can’t spend themselves and never sees. So, funds for electricity, staff to manage funds/purchases who might work with everyone in a whole dept, library subscriptions, building maintenance, library staff; cleaning staff. All of those are also research costs, you need them to be able to do the project, but it wouldn’t be efficient or cost effective to have each professor in a dept trying to independently negotiate with cleaning staff or building maintenance, so it makes more sense for the university to spend them centrally. The one part where it gets confusing is sometimes when they say “a 2 million dollar grant” for instance, that could mean both direct and indirect costs or the total amount being sent to the university from NIH",Faculty,Medium,1.0,web:pullpush:r/AskProfessors:comment:library,Medium,1,1442,249,6,John Oliver is correct about NIH grants.,0

"4 months into my PhD and I am quitting. Hi! I have done my masters in a Lab that didn't work out due to toxic inter-collegue environment, and a PI that only started my project for some grant money and wasn't really helpful. I had initially planned to fast-track into a PhD in that lab but I decided to master out instead to hopefully find a better lab for my PhD. As I joined the new lab in September, I was warned about the mice work, but I didn't expect that I would be as unable to handle it as I am. Mice work is a non-negotiable in the lab, no way to get around it. I am feeling so much stress and anxiety any time I have to go to the mouse room. However, this is not the only issue that has arise, as I soon discover, I had ditched toxic collegues for a quite toxic PI. I am new to the field, but I have no help in establishing my projects. The PI is really rude, not hesitating to say that your results is shit even if those are the first couple of time you are doing that technic, and basically getting no help. She was ""joking"" back in december that she is a dictator in her lab, but also likes to let us do our things for us to realize how wrong we are. I have heard many bad stories about how for example she can throw stuff if she is unhappy. She can be also quite passive-agressive if something is not going her way. My decision to quit has been in my head in november. A week before back to school in january, I was already feeling anxiety about going back. I have decided suddenly today to quit and have taken appointments with my department this week to look at my options. I know it is the right decision on paper, but I can't help but doubt. 2/3 of my labs have been bad experiences, and I have doubt in my mind that there is hope for me to find a good one. Should I just power through until the end in this current lab? I feel so conflicted, a part of me is happy it is soon over, and another one is sad/angry/confused to have to start over again.

"My College Is Dismissing Harassment. Hi Reddit, I'm not too sure what to do about this, or how severely I should pursue action Following a small argument, I left my boyfriends dorm to be alone in mine for the night. After I am in my dorm for a while, my boyfriend's roommate (let's call him Stan) starts blowing up my phone, swearing at me and telling me to get my stuff from his room. After all the swearing over the phone, I did not feel safe going alone, so I bring my neighbor A. When I arrive at their dorm I'm greeted by Stan and a male friend of mine. My friend is holding a bag of my stuff and tries to hand it to me. Stan stops him and demands that I give him my boyfriend's stuff first. I told him I don't have it and if my boyfriend wants it he will have to come to my room and get it, and I reach for the bag my friend is trying to hand me. This is where things got scary. Stan shoves me and starts slamming me in between the door and the metal door frame multiple times, bruising my legs and arms, and spraining a knuckle on my hand. He continues this until A grabs the door and I manage to grab my bag from my friend behind Stan. After A and I leave, I open my phone to messages from Stan saying that I don't deserve my boyfriend and a message from my boyfriend saying that Stan threw $20 worth of my things out their window. Later that night he took an expensive pair of my socks into the shower to urinate on them. He told my boyfriend that if he ever talked to me again he would punch him and make my life miserable. I am still not sure why he involved himself in this way, but I reported it to my college and filed an incident report. They told me they would talk to him and that he would likely be punished in some way. That was over a month ago. In the class I have with Stan he turns his seat all the way around to stare at me and smile. My boyfriend has started living with me in my dorm, and we only go to his room to shower (he has a suite with its own bathroom). Just today I went to shower only to find my expensive body wash from Lush completely dumped out and placed back in the shower. The total cost of things of mine that he has destroyed has reached $50. Along with the physical harm and harassment, I thought the university would do something about it, but they have not. What should I do from here? I have not talked to him since that night and try to stay away from him whereas he is still trying to make my life miserable like he promised.

"Withdrawing from research credit. over email. I am in my junior year, and currently taking a hard course load with time consuming extracurriculars. My time feels stretched thin, I'm overwhelmed, and I've decided that I need to withdraw from my 1-credit undergrad research experience. For context, this is my first semester in the lab, I started 4 weeks ago. I am working under a grad student (I've barely met the PI), and I'm still training to code videos. This grad student has put probably about an hour or 2 into training me, and she can have an unlimited number of undergrads working under her, so its not like I've taken a spot from someone else by staying. She does have other undergrads, and I didn't join directly under her, I joined the lab and then chose to work with her over the other lab members. If I drop, I don't plan on returning next semester or anything, because I am also doing research in another lab, and I will continue with them for my senior year. Ok so my questions are as follows: 1. Is it rude to withdraw over email? The building is super out of my way, an in person conversation would be in her office with many other people listening (its a big room with many desks), and I just have general anxiety about quitting in person. I'd write a formal email. 2. If I do email, can I just email the grad student I work under, or do I need to cc the PI?

"My girlfriend is in a sorority and I am torn about attending social events. Me (M19) and my girlfriend (F19) have been dating for 2 years now, and we both go to separate colleges, though only an hour and a half drive away. This semester, she joined a sorority and I felt extremely uneasy about it. Thankfully, this sorority is in like the 1% that doesn't haze and barely has any required events to go to other than new member education, so my fear of her constantly having to go to frat parties was shut down pretty quickly. The problem though is that every month or so, there is a social/dance that happens in a frat house. I don't believe there will actually be a ton of frat guys there, it will just be hosted there. The problem however is that, unlike all of the other events they host, she needs to know whether or not I will be going. If I don't go, my girlfriend will be paired with another guy from a neighboring fraternity or something so she can have a date to the party. Obviously, I would like to be the only one dating my girlfriend, so willingly sending her off to another guy is not a decision that makes me feel super awesome. The issue though is that I take some pretty major issues with going. Firstly, this dance is not going to be held in a respectable location or institution- it's in the dingy basement of a frat house. Secondly, and much more importantly, there will very likely be underage drinking at the event. Although it is within the chapter's rules not to illegally serve alcohol to those under 21, it is apparently extremely common for people to bring their own substances and consume them regardless. I really cannot afford to associate myself with this flagrant criminal activity, and attending this event would be a major legal and ethical risk. Ultimately I'm super torn. I'm kind of choosing between the lesser of two evils here, but I am not sure whether I should choose to let go of perhaps the integrity of our relationship, or actively step into a dangerous and illegal environment and risk my future job prospects and own self respect.

"What’s your experience with shitty lab partners. Hey guys, this is the first time I post anything on reddit and probably rant and vent about something on the internet at all - guess I decided to try something new for my sunday night procrastination. Excuse my grammar, native (and triggered) mexican here :) and thanks for reading if you do! So, my recent experience: I worked hard the past two weeks in a third year physics experiment with an useless pos who I helped more than I should have, giving her a lot of the answers I worked hard to grasp (not all), afterhours while she was off doing something else. She didn’t even understand how the equipment worked; basic underlying high school physics about standing waves; how to even apply a very simple operation in Excel columns; and why a graph flipped when she plotted x values as y. And I’m not listing all of the dumb and dumber questions. She ended up getting an A and me a B, and I was already thinking it would be incredibly unfair if she got the same grade as me, considering I essentially worked as if I was alone. All I got so far (after a raging email with everything I wrote above.in a more diplomatic language and triggering terms like ‘discrimination’) is the consideration of the lab head to check the marking sheets and see if he can find evidence of discrepancies. Hope to see it goes well next week. What are your experiences? P.S. No, she’s not the kind to pretend she’s dumb and just seek for confirmation in her questions. She’s as incompetent as they come.

Congratulations on getting into your dream school. My Kid1 faced this same dilemma. It is a tough one to make. Got accepted but it was over $85K/year. They offered a scholarship for about half and wanted us to take unsubsidized loans for the rest. That wasn't happening. Tried working with financial aid office to reconsider but they were not returning our calls. Kid1 tried working it up until April 30th. Finally had to decline. Kid1 chose the school that overall would cost the least to attend and allow kid1 to graduate with little to no debt. With the generous school scholarship and some smaller ones Kid1 only had to come up with funds for living expenses (dorm). Worked full time plus overtime Christmas break and summers. Did well enough that the renewable scholarships renewed every year. GI Bill the last two years to help with living expenses(off campus housing).

"Research topic or PI or school ranking. Hi I currently work in a research lab at a decent public school( top 75 public school in the US ). I got a masters and luckily got hired as a research staff soon after and now I have the opportunity to start my PhD in the same lab, my PI seemed very positive about accepting me and wanted me to apply for the PhD program. The research lab and PI are absolutely amazing, it’s a great work environment and the PI is also very helpful and supportive. But the problem is that the research being done doesn’t exactly involve everything I wanted to do. For more context I work in a robotics lab and I definitely want to get my PhD in robotics but lab doesn’t work on a specific subdomain that i’m interested in. For even more context, I’m interested in using machine learning for robotics research while my lab doesn’t work with machine learning at all. My concern is that by the end of my degree the topic i’m researching wouldn’t be as relevant in the industry and I might have a hard time getting hired. Other than that everything is perfect and the PI and the other students in the lab are extremely supportive and it’s a great place to work.

Honestly I feel like I’m losing my mind with how messed up college actually is. I don’t know how we’re all just accepting this like it’s normal. We’re taking four or five full workload classes at the same time, each with hours of reading, labs, papers, discussions, exams, group projects, quizzes, software to learn, all on completely different schedules, all with completely different expectations.

No real way to keep track of everything unless you manually build your own complicated system. It feels like we’re juggling 20 different versions of school at once. And honestly that’s why a few of us started building Durify. We were tired of drowning and tired of acting like school has to be this chaotic.

"Weiter studieren oder doch Ausbildung. Ich studiere Chemie und bin schon lange am studieren. Die letzten 3 Semester habe ich praktisch aufgrund von privaten Problemen nichts für die Uni machen können. Arbeite aber nebenbei als Werkstudent in einem großen Unternehmen und merke, dass Uni eigentlich nichts für mich ist. Ich arbeite lieber 5 Tage die Woche als in die Uni zu gehen. In dieser Firma könnte ich auch eine Ausbildung anfangen im September. Da ich ja gewisse Vorkenntnisse habe würde mir die Ausbildung leichter fallen und hoffentlich mit guten Noten meine Ausbildung abschließen. In der Uni hingegen bestehe Ich eigentlich keine Prüfung beim ersten Mal. Meist brauche ich 2 oder 3 Anläufe um zu bestehen. Gerade die Kolloquien bei uns machen mir zu schaffen. Habe Prüfungsangst, Blackout. Ich bin total zwiespältig. Auf der einen Seite könnte ich jetzt die Uni, also meinen Bachelor durchziehen und alles geben von Anfang an wenn das nächste Semester anfängt. ( Zugegebenermaßen habe ich immer für Klausuren auf den letzten Drücker gelernt. Eine Klausur im 3. Versuch gehabt und da habe ich früh angefangen und viel gelernt und dann auch eine 2.0 bekommen) Auf der anderen Seite wäre eine Ausbildung auch nicht schlecht, wenn ich mir die Entwicklung mit KI ansehe. Es gibt immer weniger Jobs für Akademiker. Meist wollen die ja auch noch einen phD sehen. Also das Fach Chemie ist auf jeden Fall mein Ding aber das theoretische gefällt mir nicht an der Uni. Aber ist das ganze Theorie Zeugs nicht etwas worüber sich eigentlich alle Studenten beschweren? Dass wir alle uns durch die Theorie quälen. Zudem kommt dass ich aus einer Einwandererfamilie komme und in gewisser Hinsicht meine Familie auch stolz machen möchte mit einem Bachelor zumindest.

"The Five Deadly Sins of Scientific Software. (Written by ChatGPT, some facts might be wrong be it could be a good laugh). — “Those Times We Waded Through Noodle Diagrams and Black Boxes” First Deadly Sin: Igor Pro — It’s Like Taking Off Your Pants to Fart, Yet Bragging About Being Handy If there’s a “Top Annoyances” list in the research community, Igor Pro almost always appears. It claims to be user-friendly with a “graphical workflow,” yet whenever you try anything mildly advanced, you’re forced to write scripts in a language that feels like it time-traveled from DOS days. • An Awkward Mix of Old-School UI and Scripting Fire up Igor Pro, and you’re greeted by vintage-looking dialogs. Then the minute you need a more complex function, you must jump into its archaic script interface. You dig through the official documentation—only to find scattered fragments that seldom form a coherent method. It’s like rummaging in a dusty garage hoping to build a modern race car. If it were just complicated, you could grit your teeth and endure. But it also tries to act like it’s “advanced yet simple,” which only adds insult to injury when you realize how clunky it actually is. • A Workflow That Feels Like Unnecessary Hoop-Jumping In Python or R, you might write a few lines of code and get a polished plot. In Igor, you open a GUI, fiddle with a million menu options, switch to script mode, edit cryptic commands, hop back to the GUI, tweak formatting… and might still end up with random export glitches. It’s like it wants you to use both mouse clicks and script editing in all the worst ways simultaneously, leaving you exhausted. Eventually, you start asking: “Why did I pay for this license when a free open-source library would spare me half the headache?” • The Double Burden of High Costs and Legacy Projects Igor’s license costs an arm and a leg. Meanwhile, some labs have old data or custom scripts locked into Igor, so junior researchers are stuck continuing this tradition. Once you taste truly modern, open-source tools, you realize just how liberating it is not having to dance around Igor’s quirks. Sure, Igor once did real work in certain specialized fields, but in an era demanding code-based reproducibility and open ecosystems, it now feels cumbersome and antiquated—like taking off your pants when you could simply do the job another way. ⸻ Second Deadly Sin: NI / LabVIEW — “Dataflow Programming” or Just a Tangled Mess of Wires? National Instruments (NI) loves to market LabVIEW as the revolutionary “dataflow programming paradigm.” Many labs jump in thinking it’s a magical solution—until you end up spending more time cleaning up spaghetti diagrams than doing science. • Dataflow vs. Actual Programming Paradigms LabVIEW touts “dataflow” as if it’s some cosmic shift in how humans code. In reality, mainstream computer science has well-established paradigms like procedural, object-oriented, functional, or logic programming. “Dataflow” can be useful in niche scenarios, but LabVIEW acts like it’s the be-all and end-all. Replacing text-based code with boxes and wires might seem intuitive for small projects, but once things scale up—loops, branches, submodules—it’s a nest of cables that would make a circuit board blush. Debugging or refactoring this visual labyrinth is far from straightforward. • Noodle Diagrams and Hardware Lock-In At first, dragging little boxes around is kind of fun, but the complexity grows exponentially. Soon, your block diagram looks like a bowl of tangled noodles, and you can’t recall which wire does what without panning all over the screen. Version control? Merging changes? Good luck. Then there’s NI’s hardware ecosystem: pricey DAQ boards, endless driver updates, and potential licensing fees. The simplest microcontroller with an off-the-shelf ADC/DAC could do the job for a fraction of the cost, yet NI sells you a “professional solution” for thousands of dollars. If your setup fails or your OS updates, you might spend hours sifting through ancient forum posts or paying for specialized support. • A Gimmick Sold as a Grand Revolution The core problem is that LabVIEW markets “dataflow programming” like it’s a brand-new frontier. In reality, it’s mostly a user-friendly façade for basic input-output control—just in a block-diagram style. Meanwhile, you’re locked into NI’s hardware, libraries, and licensing. Once you’re in, it’s tough to leave without redoing the entire system in a more conventional language. For many, the painful lesson is: “All this wire-dragging ended up being more trouble than just writing a few lines of code.” ⸻ Third Deadly Sin: Microsoft Word — The Pit of Formatting Doom, a Guaranteed Hair-Puller for Academic Writing Word is perfectly fine for simple documents, but when it comes to theses, journal articles, collaborative editing, references—basically the stuff academics do daily—it can become a genuine battlefield. • Formulas, Figures, Headers… Everything’s Ready to Ambush You Academic writing involves formulas, figures, references, footnotes, cross-links… Word was never truly designed to gracefully handle all these at once. One inserted formula can blow up your line spacing. Move a figure and watch it leap to another section. Turn on track changes, and references might spontaneously renumber. You quickly learn to save multiple backups in case a single click triggers a chain reaction that wrecks your carefully formatted document. • Collaboration &amp; Reference Management = Double Trouble Many labs rely on track changes so the supervisor can comment, plus a citation manager like EndNote. The result? A single Word file with 80 references and 30 tracked changes can freeze your PC or crash outright. Everyone tiptoes around it, hoping the next “Update Fields” command doesn’t blow up the entire references list. • Manual Formatting with No Reliable Reproducibility Word is essentially manual formatting galore. If you restructure your chapters or reorder sections, you’re stuck re-adjusting spacing, headings, figure layouts—again. There’s no script or version control that elegantly separates content from layout. Small wonder so many scientists prefer LaTeX for serious writing: once the style is set, content changes don’t break the formatting. With Word, you’re locked in a constant war with your own document. ⸻ Fourth Deadly Sin: EndNote — Reference Management or Sanity Management? EndNote was once the go-to reference tool—especially back when choices were limited. Now that it’s been integrated with Web of Science and stuffed with online sync features, it somehow got even clunkier. • Account Sync and Subscription Shenanigans These days, you often need a Web of Science account to sync libraries. One glitch in the server or a mismatch in permissions, and your references vanish or duplicate themselves. You just wanted to have the same library on your office PC and laptop, but now you have 400 new “untitled” references in one and half a library missing in the other. • A Format Editor That Makes You Sweat Adjusting citation formats should be routine: you open a style editor, pick your punctuation. EndNote’s approach? A cryptic labyrinth where a stray comma can throw the entire reference list off. You’re basically forced into a mini-cat-and-mouse chase. Many give up and stick to the default EndNote style, only to discover their target journal wants subtle differences in punctuation or abbreviation. Cue another session in the EndNote editing dungeon. • Double Whammy with Word Citing in Word with EndNote might feel nifty at first—until your document grows, references multiply, and one “Update Citations” command can scramble your entire numbering or crash Word. Then you scramble to restore a previous version, crossing your fingers that it hasn’t corrupted the fields. Meanwhile, alternative tools like Zotero, Mendeley, or a simple BibTeX workflow in LaTeX might run smoother, with less overhead and more transparency. EndNote can feel like it’s adding extra friction right when you need seamless citation management. Fifth Deadly Sin: SPSS, Origin, SigmaPlot, IDL, NCL, Excel, etc. — The Old-School Black Box Brigade Re-Inventing the Wheel Now we have the big motley crew of scientific software, each born in a time when programming skills weren’t as common. Some handle stats (SPSS), others do plotting (Origin, SigmaPlot), some do remote sensing or astronomy (IDL, NCL), and then there’s Excel, the universal “everyone has it, everyone sometimes regrets using it” tool. Each brought convenience in the old days but also spawned a tidal wave of frustrations. 1. SPSS: Click-Driven Statistics with Hidden Machinery For those who can’t code, SPSS was a lifesaver: “Just click here for regression, click there for ANOVA.” But if you need more advanced or custom processing, you’ll find yourself wrangling with cryptic menus and unpredictable scripts. Debugging? Good luck—it’s not nearly as open or flexible as a real programming language. 2. Origin &amp; SigmaPlot: The Performers of Visual Graphs They offer specialized GUIs for making decent-looking plots. But you typically rely on a thousand mouse clicks to configure your chart, with minimal support for automation or reproducibility. The second time you need that exact chart, you might be stuck repeating all those clicks. Your patience will run thin. 3. IDL &amp; NCL: Old Workhorses of Astronomy/Weather Now Past Their Prime Once upon a time, IDL was a cornerstone in astronomy and remote sensing. NCL used to be big in atmospheric science. But both are closed off or outdated, sporting arcane syntax and waning community support. Even the original developers are nudging people toward Python for modern tasks. 4. Excel: Familiar but Treacherous Excel is widely available, which ironically means it’s often misused for large-scale scientific analysis. Auto-converting gene symbols to dates or messing with floating-point data—these are classic nightmares. Sure, it’s fine for basic tables and sums, but for anything more advanced, you’re dancing with hidden pitfalls. Collectively, these tools once solved real problems when coding resources were scarce. But with modern open-source ecosystems (Python, R, Julia), paying hefty fees and dealing with closed-off, mouse-heavy interfaces feels more and more like a step backwards. ⸻ Final Word: Acknowledging Their Legacy Yet Embracing an Open Future We can’t deny these five categories of software (and their affiliates) each contributed significantly in their prime: • LabVIEW helped many engineers quickly set up control-and-measurement workflows, • SPSS, Origin gave non-programmers early ways to run analyses and make plots, • Word brought word processing to the masses, • EndNote introduced the concept of electronic reference management at scale, • IDL, NCL once powered large-scale data analysis in science, • Igor Pro had a user base that tapped into its somewhat simpler visuals compared to raw code. Yet today, transparency, reproducibility, collaboration, and scalability are paramount in research. Tools that remain closed-source, pricey, or reliant on rigid GUIs simply can’t keep up with the evolving demands. The unstoppable rise of open-source languages—Python, R, Julia—proves that researchers value clarity and control over hidden processes and vendor lock-in. In the end, nothing beats a script you can read, a community you can trust, and a license that doesn’t cost your entire grant. Sometimes, stepping away from these old pillars of software can feel like leaving behind old friends. But if we’re serious about modern, reproducible science, it’s time to embrace truly open, flexible tools—and wave a less-than-fond goodbye to those “Five Deadly Sins.” ⸻ — End —",Examination,High,2.0,web:pullpush:r/academia:submission:problem,High,2,11734,1848,5,The Five Deadly Sins of Scientific Software.,0

"Multiple-choice exams. Hello everyone, I think I have a problem when it comes to answering multiple-choice exams. At some point in my years as a student, I thought I just needed to study more, but it turns out that’s not the case.

"I took this course in Winter 2022 and I was really excited to be in a lab setting post-Covid. The experiments were fun and I was lucky to have a really good TA. He was very helpful and I had great marks on the lab reports and assignments. What annoyed me was final lab examination was worth 40% of my grade and the lab reports totalled 35%, so majority of my grade was going to be decided by the one exam, not the 5 reports I spent hours working hard on.

"I failed all my first year classes and now my life is over. I’m not asking for any sympathy I’m just stuck and really need some guidance Long story short I failed 7/8 courses in first year university. The only one I passed, I got a D-. I ended up failing not because I didn’t like my major or even because I don’t like learning and academics. I had a huge mental health episode all throughout my first year. For some background I moved about 5 hours from home to a big city to go to university as a life science student. Skipping some of the details, I’ve dealt with mental health issues in the past mainly anxiety but nothing this severe. Due to a really bad living situation(roommate from hell), new antidepressants that had the reverse effect and some unforeseen life events and health issues I feel into a severe depression and anxiety episode. Because of this I pretty much let myself fail all my courses, because I couldn’t even bring myself to drop out. I know it sounds stupid which is was but I was so depressed I’d don’t even have the energy to email to drop the courses I just let them pass me by. Now I’m facing the consequences. In April of this year, my family moved me back home and I was in intensive counselling and changed my antidepressants. Over this summer I really worked on myself. I ended up leaving that university and stayed home and enrolled in online university courses. My mental health and grades have both exponentially improved now that I have the resources I need and healed from the past year. I now am in 3 courses with an A, A- and A+ and. Because of the credits for each course I am a full time student. I determined with my family and therapist I’m now ready to try university again. However this is where my problems start. As much as these past months have helped me I feel pretty lonely and isolated being at home with no one and I miss being at in person classes and actually talking with people. I applied to 5 Ontario universities for the winter semester so this January. 3 of the universities rejected my application about 2 or 3 weeks after submitting it and the other 2 didn’t have space in the program. For the first 3 I wasn’t even able to submit my new midterm grades, meaning it was only based on my first year grades. For some background on my academic history, I graduated high-school with a 95% average and an IB certificate. Additionally I had the highest academic standing in my entire biology, ecology and anatomy sections of my highschool. I have also previously had gotten into each of these institutions upon my initial high school applications. I really don’t know what to do from here. I feel like it’s unfair that I was refused even though they didn’t have my new grades. But in the flip side my cGPA is still extremely low even with the increase in my academic performance. At this point if will take years of acing classes before I have a suitable cGPA. I feel stuck and like I will never be able to move in from this. No where will accept me and I don’t know how well I will be able to handle doing online courses because of the lack of human interaction and isolation. I so desperately want to be back in the school environment but at this point it seems impossible. I don’t even know if I’m able to maybe appeal some of the admissions decisions since they never received my new grades. I understand why i was refused but I feel like my first year grade really don’t reflect myself and my academic ability and achievements. I just want them to give me a chance but I understand that’s now how things work :( Any sort of guidance would be much appreciated! Be blunt, I feel so stuck and defeated.

"I'm being slandered, help. \*Throwaway because this is kinda sensitive and I haven't decided what I'm going to do yet I was googling my name just because, and on the second page of the results there's a webpage from another PhD student claiming I'm an awful person, that I've engaged in academic dishonesty, that I've tampered with the results in my papers, and that the ""research"" section on my website has words that are stolen from other people. These claims are 100% false and there isn't any evidence given, this person is just claiming it. On one hand, I want to absolutely destroy this person's academic career, have everyone know they're a liar, and see them publicly shamed for being a steaming shit of a human being. But exposing the lies means publicising them. Also, I'm not in the US and I'm not interested in suing anyone. I just don't know how to resolve this since there isn't a clear place to raise non-university complaints where I am. I can think of 3 senior people at my university who I trust enough to talk to (and actually know): my PI, the institute director, and the head of graduate research. How do I bring this up? Should I make it public? Do I message the person privately and ask them wtf the page is about? Has anyone had to deal with someone spreading nasty rumours before? -------------------------- **The details:** - I don't really know this person (Hayley\*). We both applied to the same PhD program, were both accepted to work under the same PI, but only I got funding. But Hayley and I weren't even competing for the same funding and there was room for both of us in the group, so we have no ""beef"". I met her through Twitter - *she* reached out to *me* and told me she'd applied to the same program. All of our interactions have been through Twitter and they're either pleasant or neutral, but I've always gotten the feeling that she thinks she's better than me. Despite clearly both being first-year PhDs who got into competitive programs, she has repeatedly tried to give me (unsolicited) advice on conferences and publishing even though it looks like I actually have more experience in those areas. Otherwise we just like and retweet each other's stuff. - Hayley is more popular/well-known than I am. She has tens of thousands of followers on Twitter and is friends with people who have 100,000+, and I have ~100. If this becomes ""a thing"" then I think people will want to side with her or try to excuse her behaviour before they believe me. I've seen people be accused of things a bunch of times, they get absolutely piled on and abused, and then there's no real compensation when they're proven innocent and people just continue to believe the lies. I don't want to be that person; I have a history of depression and severe anxiety and I don't think I could handle it. - **I think my PI likes her better.** He's talked about how great a student she is and how disappointed he was when she didn't get funding, and he doesn't give me the same praise (that I know of), which makes me feel like I was always playing second fiddle to her. He even wants us to go to the US at some point to visit her group and collaborate. I don't care if anyone else in the department/university investigates her claims just to prove they're false, but if I ask my PI for help and he starts investigating her claims as though they have *any* potential weight to them, does that mean he doesn't fully trust me? I don't think I could continue working with him if he took her word on this for even a second. - The page is hosted by Hayley's website (e.g. hayleysmith.com/street-hat-is-a-liar) but if I just go to her website homepage, I can't navigate to the page through any links or menus. It seems to only be accessible by direct link, but you can find that direct link if you google my name (I have a very uncommon name, probably unique). So maybe she didn't mean to publish it or doesn't think it's visible? - Hayley is generally pretty polished from what I've seen online, and the page is not - it's just text, and my name is all lowercase. Maybe it's a mental illness thing? Not an excuse for what she's done, but could mean she gets sympathy and a free pass. - I'm a first-year PhD who no one really knows in academia, so this could really hurt me professionally. Even if I show everyone how much of a petty, lying piece of shit she is, I'm going to look like a trouble-maker. I don't know how many people have seen the page or if she's been spreading lies on other platforms/in person. I'm no longer seeing red about this (I'm still really pissed), but now I'm panicking. I don't know what to do. I don't know why she hates me. Edit: sorry, typos",Transport,High,2.0,web:reddit:r/gradschool:search:complaint,High,2,4674,854,21,"I'm being slandered, help.",0

"Need to step away from this class for seven weeks due to passport-renewal itinerary. I can't show you proof but I still want an A."". I was an international student when younger.

"I believe professors are complicit in textbook cost inflation, and think it's time for a sea change. but I want to hear from the other point of view. I'm a relatively new adjunct professor. I've long paid attention to the rapidly rising cost of education, and in particular the cost of textbooks. I understand these issues are never single-factor and there's a tendency for all of us, and perhaps especially me, to want to simplify them. But ever since I've gotten my job teaching, I've found my anger rising more and more over how we interact with textbook companies. I teach anatomy. The basic material in intro anatomy has been roughly the same for decades. When I look at the major textbooks, of which I have at least a.PDF of 5 different ones, I see illustrations that are all slight modifications of each other, often taken from the same mid-20th century journal illustration. I see drawings that are not particularly better than the most recent public domain version of Grey's Anatomy. And when I see that, I think. gosh, textbook companies should be in really tough competition with each other right now. They should be innovating and being forced to lower prices. And they are, to some degree. There are some neat things they're doing, like incorporating digital cadaver dissections and illustrations. With that said. most of this kind of material should be easily purchasable directly from a digital media/education company, right? Why should a cadaver dissection be tied to a textbook? Why shouldn't I be able to unbundle the videos? And to some degree I can-- quality may vary, but a lot of this is available with permission from an author or from creative commons licensed material. So how do textbooks continue to inflate their prices year after year? This is what gets me hot under the collar. They use instructors as sales members. Instructors are NOT customers of publishing companies. They are effectively staff members of publishing companies. This is true in small ways; they provide us with free instructor's manuals, free tech support, and so on. But it's also true in a really big way. More and more, they are taking over fundamental parts of our job. I am at a small community college, so I cannot speak to the larger world of academia, but virtually every single professor at my CC uses quizzes, weekly homework, and exams that are created by the textbook company and graded automatically, and which directly sync to our LMS platform (blackboard, canvas, etc). And you'd think teachers would pay a pretty penny for that, right? That is a HUGE workload being taken off of their shoulders. How much do they pay? Well, zero, of course. The students pay. The students at my community college, many of whom work full time to support family members, or are first-generation immigrants, or are trying to dig themselves out of poverty-- they are the ones kicking in money to lighten the workload of the professors. The students cannot say ""no, that's too much."" Nor do they get any particular benefit from that service. And that service is what makes the textbook indispensable to many of the teachers. I think it's unethical, and I think it needs to stop. Especially in large states like California with hundreds of colleges teaching to similar standards, there is no reason we cannot collaborate in creating assessments and exams and so forth. We could even easily create our own openly licensed textbooks (many are already out there in places like libretext and openstax). I think there should be a law that treats textbook company benefits to teachers similarly to the way pharma donations to doctors are treated. A pen or lunch during an educational meeting about their subject or product? Fine, I guess. But hundreds of dollars worth of exam and assessments? That should be strictly illegal, and it should be a requirement that those costs be charged to professors. The professor can decide then if they want to pay it themselves/have their institution pay it, pass it on to their students as a fee, or whatever. Fine. But it's bullshit for students to be roped into paying for materials that publishing giants give to instructors. So. is there another side that I'm missing?

"Why is the difference between on campus and off campus housing so much. Hello, So I’m a college student who has lived independently since about 17 years old, so I qualify for a lot of grants and what not that usually help pay for my cost of living. I live in California USA. I recently found out that depending on if you live “on campus” or “off campus”, it changes your “cost of living” on your calculated financial aid SUBSTANTIALLY. (You have to select one of these with financial aid office) I’m not joking when I say this, it is about an $11,000 difference at my school. And this is a big deal because grants and what not will be cut off or capped to a much lower amount if you select “off campus”. This large difference is kind of confusing for me. Because if I pay for an apartment or rent a room close to campus, wouldn’t I still technically need to say I live “off campus”? Or does “off campus” imply that you are living with parents? —— I have lived on campus before, and I did not need to pay for a meal plan or any extra fees, it was just my regular rent price for my dorm. So I’m not sure why there is such a disparity in the differences here either. Can someone help to make sense of this for me?

"Crappy Advisor or Crappy Student? What do y'all think after reading this. A little long, so thanks for reading in advance. Tldr at the bottom. Okay so background info first: I'm in my third year at my college, trying to pursue an engineering degree. It's been pretty bumpy for me the past year and a half; my mental health tanked between freshman and sophomore year, and I've taken two medical withdrawals as a result. Covid made it worse. Depsite this, I've managed to stay on a really nice scholarship sponsored outside the school, which I'm very grateful for because my university took my original scholarships away. Now, the issue: I swear my advisor hates me, and I have no idea why. Last semester, I emailed him to sign a form that would allow me to appeal my scholarship status with the school. It was two little lines he had to sign along with his name. I sent this form to him 4 weeks I advance of the deadline. He took 2 weeks to respond, stating that I needed to meet with him. Okay, maybe he wants an update. Fine. I go meet with him (this was right before covid), explain to him why I've been delayed (medical withdrawals), and we discuss how hard I have to work to catch up. Fantastic, we're done with our meeting and he says he'll have the form signed for me the next day. I stop by his office the next day, and he's out of the office. I email him to remind him about the form, he says sorry, he'll have it to me by Friday. Okay great, I'm a little worried about the deadline coming up soon but for now it's fine. Friday comes around, oh guess what? He's not in his office. Again. So now it's been 3 weeks of me trying to get this form filled out, and I still don't have it. I ended up having to email another advisor, also his supervisor, because he doesn't respond to me the following Monday or any day after. By the end of the week, after getting a promise from his supervisor that it'll be given to me shortly, he emails me what I need. But not without a, ""I'm extremely worried about your progress in the college, and think you might need to consider other options."" Huh? We just had a 30 minute meeting about my progress, and how hard I was still willing to work on everything. Why didn't you bring this up when we last spoke? Fast forward to now. I'm resubmitting my appeal because it did not get approved last semester. I email him, again weeks in advance. He gives me the run around for two weeks, where I ask him multiple times if we need to meet again or if he needs more information. He doesn't respond. I seek another advisor's guidance and CC him, and she tells me to meet with him. He finally replies with my form. For all of the scholarship board to see, he wrote on my form: ""If student does not make progress within the next semester, she will be asked to leave the college of engineering."" No support. No words of encouragement. Just that bombshell. Not because I'll be failing out, since my GPA is way above the requirement, but just because I haven't made a lot of progress. Tldr; advisor is trying to get me to leave my chosen major after almost 2 years of making slow progress because of some mental health issues. I don't have any outside support aside from a small group of friends and it feels like I have no support from my advisor either. So is it just me that's being sensitive about not wanting to leave the college, or can you see some issues with my advisor? A little bit of both?

"About to be kicked from student teaching. Does this sound legit or questionable. I was kicked out five years ago because, between COVID 19 with me having to suddenly keep custody of my daughter full time and because I was moving at the beginning of the semester, I could never make it to the school within the first 3 weeks. They said communication was the issue and that I didn't speak to t he right person. It was SUDDEN and even came after a professor told me that I can go in the next week. It was a bad time. I don't think they forgave me.my coordinator even brought it up this semester. The university program acted like I was some kind of pariah for JUST THAT that happened 5 years ago. I had to write letters and kiss ass. I got reinstated after a year or two, but couldn't attend because I was penniless and completely overwhelmed with having to play large part in caring for my daughter without money for myself. (Having a degree in this field isn't likely to get you a job if you aren't a licensed public school teacher). I'm heavily in debt from it. Got the degree, but no license. I've been trying to teach professionally for 17 years, but had some very bad luck at the end. I was always a great student throughout college and Uni, and I was often a leader in class. Grades were mostly As and Bs. Moderate amount of Cs. Now, I started again, and at the very end of this semester, they put me on a HEAVY probation with a long list of extra hoops to jump through lest I be completely banned from a teaching license in this Midwest state. They put me on probation because I got one document in late because I needed the CTs to sign them, and I didnt realize I didn't print them out yet. Very unimportant documents, by the way, but I DID submit them before the FINAL deadline given on the syllabus. And the ONE other thing that prompted my probation was that, earlier in the semester, our group project supposedly required us to hand in our group's slideshow(which NOBODY did), and nobody said anything because we ALL thought we were good when we presented our slideshow. The supervisor was EERILY silent about this until they suddenly slapped me with a heavy probation. Seems very sneaky. I never had ONE late assignment, but I suppose they count that group slide project as an absent assignment(although, I still got full credit for it, so this already sounds fishy). Also, I submitted my final examination on time, but the email didnt go through because of a technical issue, and I only got a notification 16 minutes later and then resubkitted it. My uni supervisor told me ""too bad"" and that it was ""late"", I should have submitted it much earlier than the last 11 minutes of the alotted time, and that it makes me look undependabe. Seems harsh. These things don't instill much confidence in me that the system is fairly run. I tried contacting an education attorney just to ask questions and prepare for the worst, but received no reply. Other edu attorneys charge 300 bucks just to discuss it. The uni staff said if I make ONE mistake of any kind, I am banned from licensure in this state permanently because this is my ""second chance"". And Ive been in debt and homeless before joining the Army. I am SCARED. At the beginning of last semester, they tried saying that although I was technically allowed back into the program, the fact I was banned 5 years earlier made it so that finding a school that would host me was difficult and that they may have to drop me from the semester.I suspect the university licensure teaching staff are being sneaky. Anyway, they finally found me a school afterward. Im one of only two men in the course. Also, I'm in the National Guard. Does this sound fair? I wonder if something I posted on the internet 5 years ago is affecting this. I HAVE been told that something bad was still posted some years after I posted it. I think I deleted it. But I have no proof that they are using that as a justification to boot me. And I kind of freaked out amd was very unhappy 8 years ago in the university department about my wife suddenly divorcing me, and the receptionist offered me counseling, so I have a reason to suspect they have already made up their mind about me and figured they have to keep me from being licensed by any means necessary. They might think I am mental or something from that and have kept it in mind. I was very nice to everyone, wasn't rude, but I was hardcore hurting and I was vocal about it.

"$10,000 for a course. My mom just paid off her $30,000 graduate session fees for 2020 - 2021. We knew the tuition for her graduate program was about $28,000 since we're international students, and so we planned accordingly. Unfortunately, after covid hit, the loan company that was supposed to take care of it kinda bailed without warning. We just got an email saying they won't be dealing with it yet because of covid. They stopped accepting calls or responding to emails either. That was around July last year, I believe. Her program started in Sept 2020 and was supposed to end this July. We finally were successful in getting the loan about a week ago (after monthsss of dragging this with them), and she has to pay them back about $58,000, which we all agreed to do together as a family if it came down to that. She was failed one of the courses she took in Sept. She didn't sleep or eat for days and cried thinking about it, and I thought she should have appealed it then because she honestly believed she shouldn't have failed at all. She had done well in her other courses. She decided to retake the course instead this semester (Fall 2021) not by choice, but the course is only given once a year. We finally paid off the $30,000 for the school year she owed yesterday, and just after, she was registered for the course she had to re-take (she would have finished in July if not for this course) only to see the new balance was now $10,000 after the course registration! We couldn't believe it! Since she had taken about 3 - 4 courses for the past 3 semesters, we assumed the price for a course was about $3 - 4k. We had no reason to ask the price for a course because we never expected this plus because the loan company hadn't gotten back to us for almost a year. We did though, and we were told by student services that it should cost about $3 - 4k but to still ask student billing (I honestly don't remember if we did or not, and what happened after because we were all stressing about the $30,000 and the threats to take the account to collections and having to wait till 2022 fall again, and what not). We asked student services again yesterday and they said, 'oh, it must be charged by the term then'. When she saw the $10,000, she just broke down in tears. She hasn't eaten, slept or said a word since then. My mom, I and my sibling are all international students. I know some people may comment 'why not just go back home?' but it's not that easy/convenient since we've been here for a few years working hard for this, and this is, of course, her last semester. None of these issues were expected at all. I honestly don't know what to do because I know for a fact that we can't afford another $10,000 with the hefty debt we have to pay, not including our own school fees, rent, utilities and whatnot. I stopped working due to covid, and so she covered most of our bills for over a year. She spent months not sleeping, crying, depressed, worrying and looking for other ways to pay the $30,000 until we got an email from the loan company saying they will be paying it soon. I for one, couldn't sleep or comfortably exist knowing she was going through all that. We really can't go through this again. As much as I'd like advice, sometimes some of them just make us feel worse or downplay our hard work by telling us to 'go back home' which is totally unfair since the commenters know nothing about what we've gone through to get here.

"HELP (DESPERATE!) NEEDED! UCI CHANCELLOR CS with better financial aid or UCSD CS. Hi, I could really use some help choosing between UCI and Sixth College at UCSD, both for CS. I've been to the admit day for both schools and like UCSD a lot, but after weighing the pros and cons myself, I'm not sure where's the best decision. Financially, my family is well off enough to pay off my college tuition at either school so there wouldn't be student loans, but that would drain our savings significantly, and my little sister wouldn't have much left for her college tuition. UCI PROS: * Together with the Pell Grant, UCI will cover 38k of my tuition for 2025-2026, leaving only 5k for my family and I to pay. Part of the Chancellor's scholarship at UCI is an unknown amount of financial aid for my second year of college. No idea how much aid I'll be given in the future years, but it's at least 38k cheaper than UCSD * More classes skipped through AP credit * I have a car, so I won't be stuck on campus and there's a ton to do around OC * Off campus housing wouldn't be too expensive for me considering I can drive UCI CONS: * Boring campus environment and no energy. During admit day, it felt like there were no actual students on campus besides the volunteers * Dorms don't look that nice, might get a quad room too * Clubs looked a little dead * On campus food options are just sad UCSD PROS: * The campus vibe felt calm and everyone was pretty nice during admit day. There were also a ton of clubs and a frozen yogurt shop. * Cool programs I'm interested in. The program presentations and info sessions from admit day were really enticing. Tons of research. Just seems like more to do on campus that could help my career * More study abroad opportunity. UCSD offers more study abroad opportunities through their Global Exchange Program. Not too many opportunities unique from UCEAP though. * Beach * A bunch of employers nearby like Qualcomm and defense companies, and it seems like there's all around better job placement after graduating UCSD CONS: * Expensive off campus housing * UC Socially Dead * I heard there are parking issues and dining hall food issues. That sucks. * Campus is a little big, but it shouldn't be too bad with my college's location (sixth) If money weren't a factor, I'd definitely choose UCSD, but sadly money is a very big factor.

"My Thesis Defense day is approaching and my anxiety is crippling me, need advice. So I'm finally almost done with my Master's thesis and about to hand it in and book a day to present. The thing is I have massive public speaking anxiety, and I'm really afraid that I would screw up. I have put over 200 hours into my thesis (and I'm very proud and happy with my work), yet I feel it's unfair that's the 1-hour presentation could affect half of my grade if I'm not good at presenting. I know I could manage throughout the presentation because I did many presentations before and I have got good grades, especially with practice but **my main fear is when they ask me questions about my work, I could really go mute or mumble words that make no sense because of my anxiety**, even if the question is so easy to answer.

"Canvas issue + Emergency w/ Non-Responsive Professor. Hi all. I have a somewhat issue that I’m needing advice on and would love any input. TLDR; I’m going to be missing the last assignment in a locked module on Canvas due to a personal emergency and trying to find out if the next module will still unlock without that last submission. Professor is totally non-responsive to communications. Basically, I am having some serious personal issues (recent ER visit due to health complications, traveling out of town taking care of business/arrangements after a death in the family, on top of other things that are naturally tanking my mental health at the moment.) I have a class with one big assignment due tomorrow night that is just not going to happen due to desperately needing sleep and attending a funeral tomorrow. Obviously contacting the professor would be the first thing to do, but this professor hasn’t responded to any of my emails so far. First one was sent two weeks ago and there have been other follow ups as the situation has progressed. there is no TA or office hours either. 🙄 She has sent out mass emails from this email, which is on the syllabus, so I know it’s the right one. I’m going to go ahead and send her an email to cover my bases but trying to figure out what to do on canvas. The assignment I will miss is required for a locked module with a couple of last assignments I’m going to need to complete in order to save my grade with a zero on the ‘big’ one. Does anyone know if that module will still unlock after the due date if there is a missing assignment? I’m wondering if I should submit a blank text box so the other module unlocks, or if I can just leave it unsubmitted? At this point I am just planning to accept a zero on the missing one due to the insane circumstances which will take my class grade from an A - 96 to a B - likely 83 (if I can complete the last two activities that need to be finished.)

Officially, the first day was on July 15th, but I couldn’t make it due to some personal issues. So, my actual first day was on July 19th, and by then, it felt like everyone had already formed their groups and made friends.

There was a guy sitting next to me who was also new, but he wasn't very friendly. I tried to break the ice by asking his name and which school he attended, but the conversation didn’t go anywhere. I spent the entire day feeling out of place, unable to connect with anyone. I didn't talk to anyone besides my benchmate, who wasn’t interested in making friends either.

"Against Language Barriers: A Call to Protect International Education in Dutch Academia. The Universities of The Netherlands (UNL) have offered to prohibit a number of educational programs from being taught in English in their proposal to the Minister of Education. Psychology programs are the main target of the proposal: UNL has proposed to discontinue all international Bachelor programs in psychology at the University of Amsterdam, the Free University of Amsterdam, Erasmus University Rotterdam, Tilburg University, and Leiden University. We oppose the UNL proposal because we believe that international education is a crucial pillar supporting the high status of Dutch academia and science. Sacrificing international Bachelor programs would be detrimental to the quality of education and research in Dutch psychology. Both international and Dutch students profit from international education. Dutch students benefit from English tracks because these improve their language skills, expand their views, and let them engage with the latest scientific developments in the Lingua Franca of science. International students gain access to excellent educational programs that may not be available to them otherwise. The international classroom connects students from different countries and backgrounds, creating mutual understanding and lasting bonds among future generations. International Bachelor's programs are also essential to the research programs in psychology. They enable Dutch universities to attract the best international researchers to help educate the next generation and to conduct the pioneering research that has made Dutch psychology internationally renowned. Discontinuing the English track would, therefore, lead to a devastating loss of international talent. In addition to contributing to mental health professions, psychology plays a vital role in diverse domains such as research, recruitment, neuroscience, data science, public policy, artificial intelligence, the promotion of healthy and sustainable behaviours, the development of effective classroom teaching methods, and many others. From climate change and the obesity pandemic to polarisation, most major problems of our time have human behaviour at their nexus. A better understanding of human behaviour and the mechanisms of behaviour change is essential to tackle such problems, and society should, therefore, foster excellent academic research capable of generating actionable solutions. The UNL proposal is unjust, misdirected, and naïve. It is unjust because it disproportionately affects psychology, effectively placing the entire burden of the language barrier on one discipline. It is misdirected because it targets the wrong variable by erecting a language barrier instead of directly limiting the inflow of international students. A language barrier is not needed because Dutch universities can implement a numerus fixus on their English tracks to limit the number of international students. Finally, the strategic choice made by UNL is naïve because it is unlikely that the forces pushing for the discontinuation of international programs will be satisfied once psychology has been reverted to Dutch. This proposal sets a dangerous precedent, as it increases the likelihood that this or future governments will impose further language barriers on other programs. The current proposal thus weakens UNL’s position to resist further demands. International education, facilitated by English-language tracks, is a major asset of the Dutch system, and the academic contributions of our international staff and students should be cherished. UNL should retract this proposal, stand up for the international orientation of Dutch universities, and defend the right of universities to offer education in English. https://openletter.earth/against-language-barriers-a-call-to-protect-international-education-in-dutch-academia-8ab90d9a?limit=0",Examination,Medium,1.0,web:pullpush:r/Professors:submission:problem,Medium,1,3921,541,5,Against Language Barriers: A Call to Protect International Education in Dutch Academia.,0

"Just got kicked out (out of the blue) and now I don't know what to do. Hi everyone I don't want this post to come off as me complaining or anything, I just need advice because I genuinely was so blindsided that I have no idea what to do next and I'd appreciate any advice. Here's the (shortened) story: So this is the end of my first year in my PhD in History (I already have an MA from a previous institution). I have gotten three B+s over the course of this year (3 quarters). Also as background, I have pretty bad mental health issues that I have been actively working on all year with a psychologist and psychiatrist, but obviously they come into play in an environment like a PhD program. For instance, one of my B+s came after there was a report of an active shooter in my apartment building on campus where I was on lockdown for 5 hours after a SWAT team came through everyone's apartment with guns and stuff to clear everything out. I had class that evening that my professor still made me attend (during which she made jokes about shooters) and my final was due a week after that. Naturally, it was not my best work, especially since I disclosed to the prof and the DGS that I have been suffering from PTSD and GAD for about a decade now. Anyway, I get to about a week and a half ago, and my advisor is still talking about next steps for next year, working on language training, and even fighting to get me into classes for this summer to train me for the upcoming school year. Then, on Friday, I was summoned into a meeting out of the blue with my DGS (which my advisor, unbeknownst to me, was also at). They immediately told me ""We have decided you and history are just not a good fit,"" that they were ""dismissing me,"" and that ""5 to 10 years from now, we hope that you can look back on this and realize this was the moment that put you on the track to where you *should* be."" Throughout the whole thing (which lasted maybe 5 minutes) my advisor never spoke to me and simply watched me cry without ever even meeting my eyes.

"Nursing or Business Analytics. Hi, I want to give some background information prior to getting into this situation I’m currently in. I’m a freshman in college. I was initially at university doing Biology Pre-Pharmacy, I’m now in my second semester at a community college as undecided. Huge shift. I know. When I was at university, I was working around 20-25 hours a week. Most days I would go to school from 7:00 AM - 9:00 PM because I would be studying for an upcoming exam or quiz. I didn’t have a life. I was tired and frustrated all the time. I ended up with straight A’s but I was also sleep deprived, practically failing the first two months, and beyond stressed. I worked my ass off for those A’s. Ultimately, I decided I didn’t like how I was feeling and switched out of the school completely to save money until I finalized a decision on what to do with my life. Fast forward to today, I’m a liberal arts major (Undecided), I’m currently in between Business Analytics, initially thought of pursuing this major but am genuinely terrified of the results. All I’ve ever heard was business was insecure and there’s always difficulties establishing yourself and getting a job after. So that’s really demotivating, and I’m not sure if I want to dedicate time to a useless degree. My second option was going back into the health field. But this time instead of a Biology degree and then later pursing a graduate education. I was thinking of nursing. I know nothing about nursing. I have a couple nurses in the family. All I know is that the schooling is incredibly stressful as well and that I’ll basically be back at square one studying all day with no real life to live. I want to point out a couple of side notes. I’m incredibly terrified of failure. If I pursue nursing, I know it’s very easy to get kicked out of the program if you even fail one course. At least in a ASN program. I’m not really sure how the BSN works. The only positive side I could see from nursing is the job security once the schooling is over. I also want to note that I’ve taken dozens of career tests and they’ve all said management careers. The only problem is again. There’s no job security in business. I’ve taken a personality test as well if that helps, my result was ESFP-T personality. Ultimately, I’m lost. I have till late March to officially decide on a major according to the school. Does anyone have advice? Please let me know. And thank you",Examination,Medium,1.0,web:reddit:r/college:search:exam schedule problem,Medium,2,2434,442,5,Nursing or Business Analytics.,0

"Go to uni or CC. So I struggled a bunch with personal problems all throughout high school and didn’t take classes serious. I did enough to just pass with B’s and but would get D’s during some quarters. The point is that that me never taking school seriously, obviously affected me when going to college. I only applied to 3 schools and got in to 1 through a program but I have to take a math placement test. I took it and I would have to do basic algebra again. I know I’m not that bad at math but it’s just that my memory completely sucks and I didn’t look at any math algebra problems since freshman/sophomore year of HS. I retake it again tomorrow to hopefully score higher so I don’t have to take any non-credit classes but that’s not looking promising. If I don’t manage to score high enough, I was thinking about going to a CC and transferring to UMD since I’m in-state but I don’t know. Would it be a good idea to just attend the University I got accepted into even though I might have to take non-credit classes or go to a CC? I should add that I do plan on transferring my junior year to try and get into a t40 school. I am willing to put in the work even though I know how slim my chances are of getting accepted but I feel like it might be worth the effort because you never know so all I can do is just be positive about it.

"Undergraduate degree won't get me very far, looking for as many perspectives as I can get on a Master's degree choice. Hello friends, I am on my way to earning my undergraduate degree- a Bachelor of Arts in German Language and Literature. At the risk of sounding presumptions: yes, I am aware this was not the most economical choice. I will say, however, I have found the skills and techniques that my academic path has taught me to be priceless. As you can imagine, a four year degree in a foreign language does not necessarily open a wide variety of doors- and I am looking into pursuing a master's degree right out of college in order to make myself more marketable. My GPA is around a 3.5, but all the classes required for my major have been solid A's my entire time at university. I am a hard worker, and self motivated. My current ideas are as followed: A MA in Teaching English as a Second Language. The university I am current attending offers a graduate program- that coincidentally demands an undergraduate degree in a foreign language. At a first glance, this seems to be the next logical step. The sad truth is that my German skills will most likely never be refined enough to compete with a native German speaking person. This holds true, in my mind, for nearly every single career possibility. The Teaching English as a Second Language (TESL) degree incorporates my enjoyment for cultural studies, language, and helping others. I understand I could teach at a high school level, but this interests me very little. My other idea is Experiential Education. I got this idea from a good friend who is currently working on this himself. In an overview, experiential education is "".a philosophy of education that describes the process that occurs between a teacher and student that infuses direct experience with the learning environment and content"" Unlike my TESL idea, Experiential Education would give me a Master of Science degree, which for the course load blows my mind. Seems to carry a better weight than Master of Arts. A practical application of this is therapy- using a unique holistic approach of exercise, a strong sense of insight, and a connection to natural roots to work through problems. This, for the same reasons as TESL, appeals to me because it involves an appreciation for humanities as well as giving a helping hand to those who need it. Really, I am asking for advice for ANY masters degree. These are two paths I have found that sound appealing to me. Anything you may know of that I haven't had the pleasure of stumbling across, please let me know. Some more background about me: I lived in Brazil for a year. I went there with no Portuguese background and came back ""conversationally fluent."" I know what it is like to arrive in a foreign land, and to both not understand the language, but the culture behind a new place. I thought this experience would be helpful for teaching English to non-native speakers. It's more than just words, but the subtle differences between them, and how some things are acceptable other places and unacceptable other places. I am applying to live in Germany for the 2017-2018 school year. This is the terminal year of my undergraduate, and it would help immensely with my German Language and Literature background, as well as give me more insight into how different cultures operate. This might seem a little over-the-top, but I think it is worth mentioning. I have had a fairly turbulent upbringing. My parents were 16 when they had me, I was raised by a single mother in poverty. (My parents eventually ended up getting back together.) We spent time being homeless, living off the food shelf, etc., etc. I grew up with very poor mental health, in and out of psychologists / therapists, and struggled throughout my adolescence with being a stable individual. I really think this background gives me a significant intuition for troubled youth. I would enjoy working with young, albeit tormented or ""hopeless,"" people. In my experience, it was the integrated / holistic exercises that helped me the most with working through my own problems. I found being outside, discussion, and feeling a sense of connectedness with my environment were much more crucial to happiness than any sort of serotonin stabilizer or anti-depressant. I fully believe these medications have a useful purpose, and I don't mean to argue against them. The results of my therapy are purely anecdotal. This might be a cliche of naive youth, but I have never been one to worry over having a lot of money. I understood going into my undergraduate degree in a niche sub-group of humanities that I wouldn't be generating a lot of income. My parents both have some strong dissatisfaction with their careers and spent a lot of time telling me to do what I love. I would like to find myself making more than 40k a year, and other than that salary is not a huge deal breaker for me. I am willing to travel. I'll hopefully be living in Europe for the better part of a year, and I have already lived in South America (though it was mainly Brazil, with some touring.) I would be up to moving internally within the US (currently in Minnesota,) or internationally to pursue a career. I do not own a lot of things, packing up and moving would require minimal effort outside of paperwork / regulations. If you made it this far, thanks for taking the time from your day to take a loot at my ramblings. As a side not, hopefully the spacing doesn't bother you.

As a TA, I’m responsible for running a few discussion sections, and this is where I am having trouble because my students have no interest in the course. Since there’s no serious assignments in the course, I can’t point to those to motivate students to engage with the material.

"The Room with no Door. ""The Room With No Door"" There’s a boy who wakes up every day inside a quiet room. At first glance, it looks like any normal room — walls, books, a window with light slipping through. But there’s one problem: there’s no door. He remembers a time when he used to walk in and out freely. He read, studied, laughed, made plans. But slowly, without noticing, the walls started closing in. The light began to feel dimmer. Books became heavier. The air felt thinner. Now, even the thought of picking up a book fills him with a strange fear — like the words might fall apart in his hands. When he tries to focus, it’s like his brain runs away from him. When he tries to fight it, a wave of sadness and shame hits so hard he just ends up lying there, staring at the ceiling, wondering what’s wrong with him. People outside the room sometimes shout things like, “Just try harder!” or “You’ve got this!” but they don’t see the walls. They don’t know how heavy the air is in here, how echoing their words feel when he’s too tired to even speak. He’s tried everything: schedules, breaks, rewards, even pretending it’s all okay. But the door still doesn’t appear. What he needs isn’t someone to tell him to break down the wall. He needs someone to sit by the window and listen, someone who won’t call him lazy or lost — someone who understands that sometimes, the hardest battles are the quiet ones inside the mind.

"Rutgers Waitlist Issue. When I originally I applied to Rutgers, I was waitlisted from both the School of Engineering (SoE) and School of Arts and Sciences (SAS). I was recently accepted off of the SoE waitlist and was planning on submitting my enrollment today but was unable to due to the SoE hitting their max capacity. To preface, I was never sent an email about this waitlist update, I simply saw some activity in my portal which I just happened to check on May 2nd. A few weeks ago, when I had talked to two Rutgers AOs, they both told me that I had a week from when my waitlist decision was posted to reply to my offer of admission. They never said anything about it being a first come, first served basis as they explained how they send out waves of waitlist admissions, so admitted students have one week to decide before their spot is given to someone else. Yesterday, I contacted admissions asking them from what date I have till to reserve my seat, to which they said they didn't know and that they would ask another AO to provide me more info. Today, an AO sent me an email saying the SoE is at max capacity, so I would only be able to do an internal transfer if I wanted to join the SoE. Once I got this email, I called the admissions office again and they said there was nothing I could do about it and I couldn't even stay on the waitlist in case someone drops out of their enrollment because all enrollments are final. I emailed admissions again after this just asking for some clarity and what I could do, but I am really worried I will not get off the waitlist even for SAS which is now where I think I want to be. Does anyone know if Rutgers SAS is now also at max capacity or do I still have a shot of at least getting off that waitlist? Is Rutgers SoE completely off the table for me atp? Please also leave any advice/tips for me as the SoE was my top choice school. *Additional information: I will still be attending Rutgers in the School of Environmental and Biological Sciences (SEBS) if SAS does not work out and probably internally transfer later on. I also wanted to say that at the SoE, my intended major/academic interest would have been BME.

"How to cope with favoritism and unfair treatment in graduate school. I’ve just completed my second year in my graduate program. I hate to admit it but my time here has been more stressful than it needed to be due to the interpersonal dynamics of the program. I’ve noticed that many of the faculty members show a great deal of favoritism towards certain students. These students are labeled the “golden children” and are often given numerous opportunities that others simply don’t get. I personally feel like I’ve always been given the short end of the stick since starting the program. My lab supervisor has given me basic and remedial work to complete, while other students have had the opportunity to take more initiative in the research process. Additionally, practically all of the students in my cohort have been given the chance to teach courses on campus. However, I’ve been forced to teach online classes for two years in a row. These are just some of the many instances of unfair treatment. I get very upset when I see other faculty members practically idolize other students in my cohort. I have received good grades and evaluations from my professors. However, I feel ignored because my hard work and effort are never fully acknowledged in the same capacity as other students. I was wondering if this kind of treatment in graduate school is normal. I personally find this unhealthy because it fosters a great deal of hostility and competitiveness among students.

"Importance of checking the University Rankings. As a student, have you ever been concerned about the ranking of the University you are planning to take admission at? These days you will find several ways on the internet that can help you choose the right institute. [University reviews](https://www.thecampusadvisor.com/) are one of the most popular and effective ways to do that. Once you start to look, there are so many Universities offering similar courses which makes it difficult to figure out which one is better. That is why people turn to the internet to find out as much as they can about a particular University. **University Ranking** Are you aware of what are the University rankings? And how much of an impact does the University ranking has on the admission process? The ranking is given to different Universities based on various factors. For example, when you check for [Erasmus University Rotterdam ranking](https://www.thecampusadvisor.com/institute/netherlands/757/erasmus-university-rotterdam), it is derived by keeping factors like a good education and healthy results, an ideal study destination, additional services, etc in mind. The ranking of a Unversity says a lot about the institution on a global level. **Why check the rankings?** In case, you are in a conundrum trying to choose between 2 Universities that you shortlisted you can look at their ranks and you will know which one to go for. Other than that, rankings are necessary because: &amp;#x200B; * **Tells about the Reputation of a University** When you are searching for the [best Universities in Ireland](https://www.thecampusadvisor.com/ireland), you would want to choose from the most reputed institutes in the country. Many students look over the rankings to learn about the reputation of a place. It helps a student to know which University is more preferred over others and why is it so. Anyone would want to go and study at a place, this will result in an increase in the reputation that has been known to provide a good education from a fair amount of time. &amp;#x200B; * **Allows students to frame their future** How far do you think of while taking admission in a University? When you decide to go for higher studies at a University you should know what are your plans after that. You should know how will you find a way in the industry. Students consult the rankings so that they can enter a place that has links in the industry and have the potential to offer placements to them. If you are in college you must know what will be your next move. &amp;#x200B; * **Gives an idea about the Campus Environment** Besides all the other reasons why University rankings are effective, one crucial factor is that an individual can get familiar with the culture and surroundings of the institute beforehand. You should know what type of environment suits you. A place where you are going to learn should have an atmosphere that is comfortable and promotes learning. When checking the [University of Melbourne reviews](https://www.thecampusadvisor.com/institute/australia/50/university-of-melbourne) or other place’s rankings campus environment must be among the first things you see. **Conclusion** Those of you who are searching for a platform where you can consult and compare rankings of Universities around the globe can visit **The Campus Advisor** where you can clear all your doubts regarding a University",Examination,Low,0.0,web:pullpush:r/university:submission:placement,Low,0,3402,542,5,Importance of checking the University Rankings.,0

"Dealing with toxic supervisor (Master's) and insane departmental politics. Hello all! I am kind of on the verge of giving up while writing this post. I am posting to get advices from people who are in academia, although it might sound like a venting post. Last year, my supervisor collaborated with another professor of my dept. Now this guy is a known creep among the female students, I was one of the victims of his subtle but creepy flirtation, suggestive comments and gestures. When asked to work with that person, I politely refused. After that things have turned from worse. **For a whole year, my supervisor didn't talk to me, he didn't response to my mail/text.** If I went to meet in person, he always told me he'd let me know when to come. He would not even work on that paper, and literally avoid me in every way possible. Mind you, I continued working the lab: regular work, lab management and mentoring UG students, etc. Except no update on my Ms. Now, I have two options, I change the supervisor, it will only take more time. But that will mean I will lose LORs from my supervisor and other thesis committee members. My current supervisor is also my UG supervisor and I worked as an RA for him for 2 yrs. I am also writing 2 manuscripts with him atm. I will lose them too. Second, I can just be done with this MS, but with very simple bioinformatic analysis. The problem is that way I won't be able to work on the project that I wanted to work on my ms, I wrote the proposal for grant, I worked on it for a year and I also have everything ready for the final run. I am also worried how would any of it impact my future application to any grad school? If you can suggest me what would be the best thing to do in this situation, it would really help me. Except don't ask me to complain to Proctor/Dean. I am from a south Asian country, everyone gets away every dirty politics they do. No point of complaining. Previously we made anonymous complaints against that guy, but all in vain, Rumor has it my supervisor actually helped that guy to get rid of the complaints.

I'm not one for confrontation, and this is my first year teaching, so I let them finish the final exam period. For some of them, I had noted ChatGPT-like answers in the past on no-credit daily checks, which baffled me since there is no grade for it, just a comprehension check and a chance to practice questions in the same format as the assessments. My current college has NO guidelines for how to deal with academic integrity infractions, just definitions for what counts as dishonest. I've reached out to my department chair for their advice, but my inclination is to give them a 0 for the final. Any advice for how to go about that and makes sure I cover my behind when it comes to potential angry student complaints? Most of my students are honest in their work, so it's really upsetting that a few students abuse my lack of restrictions on keeping their phones on their persons. I've had profs had us turn in phones before and after exams and it felt militant, but I guess I understand now :/",Examination,Low,0.0,web:pullpush:r/Professors:submission:complaint,Low,0,1255,232,5,Students actively using ChatGPT on phones during Final Exam.,0
"I am fairly new to a department where almost everyone is female. I have taken over running/teaching of some modules. I thought I was doing a good job; student grades are up since I started teaching the modules and student reviews are positive. I enjoy teaching the modules and get on well with the students, but I feel like I am being mobbed by my colleagues. They constantly send round email complaints about the module and small issues get blown out of proportion.

So I was supposed to start a bfa program at this college 3 years ago and couldn't attend, for 3 painful years, because my obsessed mother took over my life and I had no stability and nowhere to go.

I've alone, I'm very depressed, and I have emotional issues, or lack of emotions. I've been in this city and I know no-one. I've had to delay a year. I could start this fall. I won't put off my education and finding gainful work any longer. I'm sending this email to my advisor, who's been holding out on me for awhile because she thinks I'm smart and promising, but I'm detailing a lot and not sure if I'm oversharing.

"The Solution to Scientific Funding and Publishing. I’ve been brainstorming solutions for two major issues in science: the funding model and the publishing system. Let me hear your feedback. # 1. The “Novel” Problem The current funding system prioritizes novel research, which leads to unstable science and a lack of emphasis on replication. To address this, we could **split government funding** into two categories: one for **novel research** and another for **research verification**. Proposals for replication should justify why additional verification is needed. This wouldn't cost more, and with a proper split would actually speed scientific discovery. # 2. The Journal Problem Journals gate keep knowledge by charging high fees for access and publishing. To solve this: * **Eliminate paper copyrights** (you can copyright the content, but not the paper itself), effectively ending the traditional journal model. * Shift to **community-driven review systems** similar to Reddit. Volunteer websites would host papers and survive off of donations (think scihub and arxiv). Review would work by community ratings, rated comments, and funded research verification (from the above solution). Members would have a **reputation score** based on activity, and only reputable members could submit, comment, moderate, or vouch for someone new to submit * We've seen a **similar systems work already**. The computer science field has collectively agreed to publish their papers to arxiv to avoid Journal fees, and places like PubPeer and openreview.net have a discussion forum alongside the traditional review process. * **Other implementations** of this model could spring up as well, creating a vast landscape of websites each with their own reputation or focus. This guards against monopolization of the system. This model allows free access of peer reviewed information, give researchers more power within the publishing system, and provide a more open means to publishing. # Potential Challenges &amp; Solutions 1. **Academia’s Role:** Professors would need to be moderators to stay competitive, but wouldn’t be more taxing than current peer review duties. This also ensures that moderators are highly qualified. 2. **Algorithm Influence:** Changes to the reputation algorithm could effect a researchers career by making them loose points over night. This is the same issue youtube has with their ad revenue algorithm. To prevent this, we could preemptively pass laws preventing drastic algorithm changes once they’re established, ensuring trust and stability. 3. **Upvote Manipulation**: The issue of popularity-driven incentives exists in the current system with Journals preferring to publish popular subjects and authors agreeing to reference each other. Similar problems would persist but would be lessened by the added policing of moderators. # Political and Practical Considerations * **Publishers** will fiercely oppose these changes. But support could be gathered from **universities** because of the cost savings. Plus the smaller universities don’t have an established reputation in the current system. * Support could come from **individual science influencers** (like Neil Tyson or Destin Sandlin), and **websites** that would be in prime positions if these plans were instigated, like scihub or fourthievesvinegar. * **Implementing** the reddit model before eliminating paper copyright would set the landscape and provide a proof of concept.

What makes this even worse is that she **knew exactly what she was doing** and acted purely out of **self-interest**, showing no regard for academic integrity or the consequences of her actions. After transferring, she **reinvented herself, pretending to be a high-achieving, hardworking student**, completely erasing her past misconduct. Meanwhile, at UNC, she ignored all responsibility and accountability. I’m upset because this wasn’t just an ordinary case of someone making a mistake—it was calculated and selfish. She manipulated the system to her advantage while others who faced similar consequences had to accept them.

"So is the correlate to this that kids who are getting into selective colleges are mostly cheating to do so? If the answer is yes, then why do we give an F if someone gets into a selective school? Maybe we shouldn't. Apparently the kids with integrity aren't the ones getting in. And other ""dumber people"" are cheating to get ahead? Is your advice to do what the dumb people are doing? Cheaters have a hard time stopping cheating. If you cheat to get into Harvard, then you probably are going to have to cheat to stay there. If you don't get caught and land your dream job, you'll be ""forced"" to cheat to keep up with your co-workers. Or to get the grant you'll have to fabricate data. Or to land the sale you'll need to fudge the numbers. Maybe you'll get away with it for a while. But even if you do, you have done your part to undermine confidence in the very schools you idolize -- and your personal integrity and intellectual growth as well. I completely agree that education in the US has a problem with fairness, and student behaviors are only part of it; for example, the universities undermine it every time they let in a billion dollar donor's kid over a math whiz. But the solution is not to lower your standards, but to raise them.

"I think I have adhd and it’s ruining my life. I (18f) am a third year university student. When I was younger, I think in 11th grade, I stumbled across a quora post which described a couple of uncommon symptoms of adhd, although I only remember one of them, which was not being able to move on with your day until you remembered something. I did that a lot and had the rest of the symptoms but I shrugged it off. (I was having trouble in school by this point, from 10th grade, when work became significantly harder). Fast forward to a year later, in 12th grade where I was studying for university exams and I just couldn't concentrate both in class and when I was studying on my own. I realized that I was only noticing it then because was having trouble with school. Although when I was much younger I did relatively well, I didn't study on my own at all but the teachers were engaging and the information was interesting. Fast forward to university and I am doing poorly. Right from my first semester I have failed a course because I don't understand and I am not able to put in the necessary work. I've brought it up to my parents a couple of times and they think I'm saying nonsense. I know internet tests aren't a real diagnosis, but they showed that I have a high chance of having adhd. This semester I am slowly getting the hang of things, although very slowly and lam starting to like school again. The issue now is that my results from last semester just came out and my cpa has dropped so much and I have failed so many courses. Because of this I might not get an internship placement, which is necessary to graduate. Also, I'm terribly disorganized and I have tried everything so I just put my stuff in little baskets. I'm also having issues in my relationship because he says I don't speak when we're together and he does all the talking. It's not like I don't want to speak, more like I don't have anything to say and can't keep the conversation going. I'm aware whatever I do now will have an impact on my future but I can't just get anything right. It's extremely frustrating and heartbreaking. It feels like my life is falling apart. I'm terribly ashamed and I can't tell my parents about my results. It's painful because I actually sat down to study but I couldn't. Or if I did I'd forget. I wasn't motivated. I couldn't concentrate. I couldn't understand. Even though I went for every single lecture. Year after year. The same story. It's not fair. I'm grateful because at least I'm not repeating the year.

Am I screwed? There is no way they would take that annotation as change the axis label to a - j right and then proceed with that correction without checking with us, right? It makes no logical sense. Would the production team **double-check the figure and realize the correction is to the curve labels and not the axis labels**, before making a change or should I email them a quick clarification to be safe? I’m worried they might misinterpret my correction. Has anyone dealt with something similar?

"I’m a medical student. You are using ChatGPT wrong. Here are the specific prompts I use to replace flashcards and lectures. I see a lot of students using AI to just ""summarize this PDF"" or ""write this essay."" Honestly, that’s a waste. It’s passive learning, and usually, the output is generic fluff. I’m a first-year med student living alone, so I don’t have time to waste. Over the last few months, I stopped using AI as a writer and started using it as a Simulator. I spent about 200 hours tweaking prompts to act as a ""Second Brain,"" and it’s completely changed my retention. I wanted to share the 3 specific prompts that actually work for deep studying. You can copy/paste these right now. 1. The ""Feynman Engine"" (For understanding complex topics) Stop asking for summaries. Ask for levels of explanation. This forces you to understand the logic, not just memorize jargon. Prompt: ""Explain the concept of [INSERT TOPIC] in 5 levels: ✅Like I'm 5 ✅Like I'm in high school ✅Like I'm a college student ✅Like I'm a master's student ✅Like I'm a PhD expert Use analogies for the simpler levels."" 2. The ""Ruthless Examiner"" (For Active Recall) I use this to simulate oral exams. It’s stressful, but it works way better than Quizlet because it grades your reasoning, not just your keywords. Prompt: ""Simulate a strict oral exam for the subject of [INSERT SUBJECT]. Ask me one complex, open-ended question. Wait for my answer. Grade me A-F based on depth, accuracy, and terminology. Tell me what I did right, what I missed, and how to improve. Then ask the next question."" 3. The ""Logic Auditor"" (For Essays/Papers) Never ask AI to write your essay (it sounds like a robot). Ask it to audit your logic. Prompt: ""I am pasting my essay draft below. Do NOT rewrite it. Instead, give me a bulleted list of feedback on: ✅Weak arguments or logical gaps ✅Structure and flow ✅Tone issues ✅What I should fix to strengthen it ✅[PASTE ESSAY]"" The Results Since switching to this ""Active"" AI method, my study time has cut down significantly because I'm not re-reading notes anymore. I'm just simulating exams. I actually organized these (plus a few others for scheduling and clinical cases) into a Notion dashboard I call the ""Limitless Vault"".

This is working out, taking showers, making my own food. 15 hours a week. 4. Do things that aren’t work, study, or sleep. Like read a book that I’ve always wanted to read. Or relax. Or DO NOTHING AT ALL. 8 hours a week. 5. Thesis. Oh yeah, did I mention I'm defending my FUCKING thesis in 4 days? Cool. 5 hours. TOTAL: 85.5 HOURS A WEEK Now, you see, if I take a Sabbath like a good Christian should, that’s roughly 14.25 hours a day. NON-STOP. NO BATHROOM BREAKS, NO TIME TO SLACK, NO TIME TO FORGET A ZOOM CALL, OR DO SOMETHING STUPID, OR JUST ENJOY LIFE. If I want to get everything done, and sleep 8 hours a night, I can’t make three, healthy meals a day. I can’t adequately exercise or play video games or call my friends. I can’t fuck around on Reddit or sleep in. Here’s the thing though. I am a human being, not a machine. So, things fall through the cracks, things slip. I sleep through my alarm because I’m exhausted so I only have 10 hours to do 13 hours worth of things. Suddenly, the day before, my professor wants to Zoom for an hour and lecture on top of the 2.5 hours of lectures she’s already given us. Suddenly, a project I started on for fun has taken up 5 hours of my time and I can’t finish work. Suddenly, I’ve stopped doing work altogether for a class and pray everything will be alright. Suddenly, I start lying on my time card, not finishing my work but getting paid for it, so I can pay my bills and feed myself and save enough money in case I get sick (oh yeah, I forgot to mention, my parents both lost their jobs and with them, my health insurance. Sure wish we could trust that good ol private insurance everyone loves). I just want to fuck around like the rest of my friends! Whose parents send them money so they don’t have to work, or they have a spouse who can pay all their bills. I WANT TO BE ABLE TO FINISH MY WORK IN A DAY SO I CAN DO SOMETHING OTHER THAN WORK AND NOT FEEL GUILTY ABOUT IT. So, dear professors, please stop suddenly scheduling Zoom calls. Please stop adding things to my work load. Please just let me coast to the end of my last semester like I planned. I worked so damn hard at the beginning of this semester so I wouldn’t have to now.

"How to reject the offer of writing a paper with your advisor during your master. Hello everyone. I'm currently writing my thesis and more or less half of is completed. I actually want to graduate as fast as I can because I'm kinda tired of writing a thesis (been trying to get my ducks in a row for the last one year). I actually do not work currently (havent been working since 2023 Feb) and living with my parents and I want to work in the industry and earn some money. So, the problem is I will defend my thesis rain or shine and graduate after 3 months somehow and someway but my advisor actually said ""let's just write a paper together"" and I could not able to say or comment anything on it. I was actually kinda scared to say ""Actually, I'm not willing to write a paper because bla bla. (the reasons are given above)"". Is it OK to tell him that I do not want to write a paper? What is the proper way to tell him? Can he take actions of like ""if you are not writing a paper with me, you will not be able to graduate.""

"The Student Who Disappears vs The Student Who Is Dead Weight. The student who disappears is the student who just quits coming to class. They quit doing any work. Their zeros and their absences pile up. And whether you reach out to them or not, you never hear back from them, so you drop them by the drop date. Cut and dry, I prefer that student. However, I have more and more students who keep coming to class, but they do absolutely nothing. They don't do the discussions, the quizzes, the tests, or the essays. I have one student this semester who even shows up to class fifteen minutes early each session. He has never been absent. But his semester average is a 2%. That's right. All he has turned in all semester is the first day discussion post. So, last week, I walked up to him before class, and I told him, hey, you know it's mathematically impossible for you to pass this class at this point. You don't have to be here. But still, he keeps showing up for every single class. Same with some other students. It used to be in the past I would drop students like these for non-participation, based on a policy I had in my syllabus. But now our administration contends that while we can drop for non-attendance because that is tied to funding and state law, we cannot for non-participation or grade. That is, a paying student has the right to fail, attend class and do nothing. It is a student right to be there. Well, I feel disrespected by these students. Students like these can suck the energy out of a classroom.

"Is Taking a Drop Year After 12th Really Worth It in India. Hey everyone, I’ve been noticing how common drop years have become, especially for JEE/NEET and other competitive exams. Almost every second student seems to be considering it. So I genuinely wanted to ask -is taking a drop year after 12th actually worth it in India today? On one hand, a drop year can mean better preparation, improved rank, and possibly getting into a top college. On the other hand, there’s pressure, mental stress, comparison with friends moving ahead, and the uncertainty of “what if it doesn’t work out?” Do you think: A drop year increases maturity and clarity? Or does it add unnecessary pressure? Does college brand matter more than starting early? And how much does skill-building matter compared to exam rank?

"Should I attempt to transfer. Im nearly finished with my first semester of college and Im not feeling good at all. Originally, I got accepted into a few top US colleges, but since I couldn't afford them I had to settle with one of the few universities in my country that teach my major (film). At the beginning of the semester, I thought this was an ""it could be way worse"" scenario, but now I feel like I made the wrong choice. One big red flag is their COVID response. We are having all classes online, but they also decided that we would prioritise all common subjects for all majors. As a result, I have had only one class specific to my major and I feel like I haven't learned anything. To be completely honest, I feel like I'm majoring in graphic design and not film. Also, some of the lessons that are being taught aren't really suitable for online class. For example, I have a photography class every week, but my grades have been stagnating because I can only take pictures of my house. Overall, I don't know if part of my complaints are just specific to the pandemic, but I do feel like the way it's been handled hasn't been good. &amp;#x200B; Then, there's the problem with academic level. Overall, I feel like all the effort I went through to be able to get a shot at a good university has been for nothing. I did the IB, the SAT and other internationally recognised programs, but college feels a lot easier that that. I feel like high school was much more difficult. I talked with someone that graduated years ago, and they said that indeed the academic level of the university has gone really down since then. I personally like a challenge, so I feel very defeated because of this. Unlike other universities, I can't get extra credit to speed through subjects, and I can't do a double major or a minor to increase the challenge. Then there's Hitchcock class. It's ridiculous. The only class from my major is the one that makes me feel ashamed of liking film. The teacher is terrible and I feel like im not learning anything. Its supposed to be more of a discussion based class, but most of the time it becomes a lecture of her talking about herself. We cannot question whether the films are bad because to her Hitchcock is a god, and there's nothing we can do about it. I feel like this class is the embodiment of a ""film bro"" stereotype, and it makes me feel like a snob for going to film school. More seriously, there has also been a very big sexual assault case recently. The head teacher for film was accused by various students of inappropriate sexual advances, and has been suspended from teaching the entire semester. Although the fact that my university did something about it is good, the way its been handled has been bad. Instead of getting a temp for all the classes he used to teach, they have been cancelled for the time being. Also, they sent an email to the entire school saying that he's no longer being investigated for sexual misconduct, but that he's only being suspended because he verbally abused all women in my major after the allegations came out. Its all pointing towards him being reinstated next semester and although I wouldn't be targeted by him, I wouldn't feel comfortable with a predator being in such a position of power. Also, the email suggested that the board of directors does not believe the allegations, and I don't know how to feel about that. Finally, probably the biggest reason for wanting to transfer is that im a very curious person and I've always wanted to do a minor or a double major. I really want to do ancient history and film, but in my country double majors and minors do not exist. The environment in my college and in my country doesn't really support this type of exploration, so I feel like im being greatly limited here. However, there's also many reasons why I shouldn't. First, there's the COVID pandemic. Student visas have been halted, so even if I successfully got into a good college, I might not be able to attend in a while. Then, there's the same problem as before: money. If I couldn't afford a tuition with 1/3 scholarship before, I think it would be worse now. Also, due to the cancellation of the IB this year due to the pandemic, I didn't really get the best grades ever. For these reasons, I don't know if id even get into a good university f I tried. Overall, im conflicted. I would like to ask for advice on whether its worth it to try or not. In case it helps, I got a very high SAT, subject tests, and TOEFL. Im also getting very high grades in college. If you think it would be a good idea, I would also like to ask for some college recommendations that could give me a good scholarship or that are affordable.

"44 year old, attempting to finally earn my Bachelor's, in need of some advice. I begin higher education 25 years ago, bounced around to a few community colleges for some semesters, essentially got atrocious grades, and then gave up and put it behind me. I began to take classes again in 2015, and have been taking a semester here and there, at various schools, since. I've mostly gotten really good grades, A+s cross the board for most semesters, but I haven't really had much of a focus for what I actually want to do with my degree when I actually finish school. University, for me, has mostly been about tackling required classes part-time at various schools while I've been working over the years, and I realize how badly I've really shot myself in the foot by having this careless approach to school. And I realize that that's really my own fault. I think it would make the most sense, based on the classes that I have taken, to try to finish a basic Liberal Arts degree as soon as possible, because I really haven't accumulated enough credits in any other major that wouldn't take at least two years to complete. I applied (and was accepted) to a school that I actually attended 25 years ago, and I could basically fast-track a Humanities degree there in 2 1/2 semesters, starting this Summer. It would make a lot of sense, but the one problem is that they say that while they're able to transfer 107 total credits from various schools (leaving me only needing 30 more), they can only transfer my GPA from classes that I originally took at this school. This starts me at a 1.486, which is. just atrocious. My GPA elsewhere was usually hovering between 3.8-4.0. I'm not sure if I could remediate that GPA enough by getting all As in the remaining 3 semesters, or if it makes sense to just find another school where I could potentially end up graduating with a \~4.0.

I already planned to use student loans for miscellaneous personal expenses. but now I’m wondering if I’m going to need to use them for my part of the mortgage too. Especially if the program is too rigorous for me to work even just one shift a week. The amount I would need a month is similar to what most students need for rent anyway. Has anyone had experience with this? Is this allowed? lol. Was the amount granted by fafsa enough? did y’all run into any problems? is paying off one loan with a different type of loan a stupid idea? tl;dr: if grad school is too tough for me to hold down a part time job, can i use student loans to cover my portion of the mortgage for the house i’m about to buy?",Placement & Career Services,Medium,1.0,web:reddit:r/gradschool:search:exam schedule problem,Medium,1,1691,327,17,"Just bought a house, now maybe going to grad school.",0

"People say college is the best time of your/their life, how do I know if I made the right choice. I'm a 19-year-old male and I'm just finishing my first year of college. I had a pretty good time I guess you could say it's nothing too special. I was fairly popular in high school, I really enjoyed my time but I don't wanna say I peaked in high school cuz that's cringe. Let's just say I'm glad my HS experience was what it was but I'm ready to move on. I'm from a Midwestern state in the US, and grew up in the Midwest my entire life but for college, I wanted something completely different and so completely out of the ordinary, so I decided to go to a 4-year university in Central Europe. I study in a beautiful city, I wish I could say I've traveled a lot but I really haven't outside of the City I'm in, I guess I just figured I could do it later, or I'm just busy with Uni. I've made friends, we hang out go on picnics, and it's fun and all. I have a close friend who is a native and I often spend time at their house so I do have that home-like connection here. My trouble is figuring out what my issue with this place is. I have close friends, it's a beautiful city, my major is ok, and the University is beautiful. I guess my only issue is that my uni is weird. It's a private university which is nice for me I guess, its rather small. Americans always pay tuition fees, but Europeans do not so much. So the Majority (not all) of my school is full of stuck-up Europeans who are studying off of daddy's money. The ones who aren't spoiled brats and are my friends are OK people, some are just weird as hell. I guess what I'm trying to say is my University experience isn't out of the ordinary enough for me to hate it I guess, but this doesn't feel like the best 4 years of my life, they just feel like me going to school, and hanging out with friends every now, partying getting drunk, etc, and then and then going back to my apartment. people also say college friends stick with you for life, and while I've made a lot of friends and some close friends, to be honest I wouldn't be too distraught if they stopped being my friend.

"Quitting accelerated BS/MS program. Long story short: I'm an undergraduate senior at a US university doing an accelerated masters. I've been offered a research assistantship to cover all tuition and provide pay for when I fully transition to the MS program. I'm currently doing an undergraduate research assistantship with the same professor. I was working on a project for the past year/year and a half which was supposed to be for my masters thesis, but has now been determined unfeasible. From my perspective, the project was majorly slowed down due to the lack of equipment the university had and the poor state of their labs. I'm in the stage of trying to pick out a new project, but based on the last one, I have doubts that the university has the proper facilities and support for me to be able to accomplish anything respectable, regardless of the topic of the project. I've also been considering switching to a field that the university has no resources, professors, or facilities for. Anyways, I'm thinking of quitting the undergraduate research assistantship, rejecting the offer for a funded masters, and applying for other schools. But, for this to happen, I need the LOR from my advisor, as a majority of my academic experience has been under him. I'm wondering if this is going to burn the bridge with my current advisor, or if he will understand and still do the LOR. I'm planning on describing the situation to him later today, more based on that I want to switch fields to one the university doesn't have, rather than criticizing the resources of the university itself.

I’m currently a freshman and I am transferring colleges next year since my current one doesn’t have my major (came in undeclared with no idea at all, finally realized what I wanted). I’ve applied to a few schools, and I’m having a terrible time deciding. One school is 28K a year. I’m already accepted into the program I want (nutrition). I’m guranteed to graduate with a nutrition degree. I hate the school though. I visited two years ago and it was terrible. I went for admitted students day and the professor for my major I was interested in at the time didn’t show up so I had to spend the day tagging along with a major I had no interest in. Also, it’s in the middle of nowhere. My brother goes there and loves it, but I just hate it. I’ve had bad experiences with the school. But again, I’m accepted into the program for sure. The other school I’m accepted into, but not guranteed into the program. I have to spend the first two years taking prerequisites and then prove myself to get the 12 seats available for the nutrition program. Only 12 spots available.

There was the idea being thrown around that I go to the cheap school, and If I don’t make it into the program then to transfer to the other school to finish my degree. I’d still be saving money. But do I really want to transfer a SECOND time? And what if the other school has different requirements and I’m delayed yet another year of graduation?

"Sportsball = Unlimited Free Passes (LOL). I am laughing and also filled with rage at the same time. I teach at a small D3 school. Last semester, I had a student I'll refer to as Sean. He is on one of our lesser-quality sportsball teams. I have multiple students on this particular sportsball team. Sean was a slacker last semester, earning himself a grade of C- in an intro-level class I teach that has no midterm and no final. That class was easy. Sean earned a C- in my easiest class. That should tell you something. For some reason, very much to my dismay, Sean decided to enroll in another one of my classes this semester. This class is much harder than the one that Sean barely passed. It has multiple exams and numerous small in-class assessments. At the beginning of this semester, Sean gave me the standard letter from his sportsball coach that says ""Sean is on the team. It is his responsibility to let you know when he has games and to make up any missed work."" (Paraphrasing but that was the gist of it.) I had a few other students on that particular team, and they all wrote to me to let me know when they had sportsball obligations. Much of the time, those other students did their best to make up missing work. Not Sean. Sean NEVER informed me about playing in a game or any other athletics-related commitment, and never contacted me about making up any missed work. How much work did Sean miss? Sean bailed on three-quarters of our class sessions, all but one of the exams (he sat for one and earned a grade of 42% on it), and two-thirds of our in-class assessments. I don't care. Sean fails, and that's on him. Sean emailed me to ask if he can pass the class. I tell him no. Then he emails me back and says, **""I want to be clear with you that I did the responsible thing by telling you in the beginning of the semester that I had \[sportsball\]. It's not my fault that all of my games were on days we had tests.""** First of all, I don't think that's true, because his teammates all showed up for most of the assessments (including exams).

Hence why I think Skidmore felt better. A notch or two below Vassar probably. But if he can get into Vassar shouldn't he go because it's a better school? I think the problem is that Vassar fits too, but Skidmore fits better. For people who have been in this situation, what did you do? Go with prestige or the better fit? He doesn't know what he wants to study but probably along the lines of chemistry/STEM.

"UC Berkeley Haas vs. USC World Bachelor in Business. I am very grateful for being able to have two great options both in California. Just having a hard time deciding which school would take me further. I'm looking to expand my network and go into finance in the future I'm also open to working on Wall Street, but I don't mind staying in California for work here. Overall I'm very flexible career and location wise (consulting on the table). Potentially may get MBA depending on performance at school GPA wise. Cost for both schools not an issue around the same with scholarships For Berkeley I got in for Business Administration for the 4-year Spieker Undergraduate Program about 200-300 students. Berkeley is great for tech, startups, and is pretty good for finance and consulting too especially with its clubs. For USC I got in for the World Bachelor in Business Major (Business Administration). I will be attending USC, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and Bocconi University. I would receive 3 degrees from each school in business admin. It’s about 45 students selected only. From what I know about this program at USC is that 25-40% go straight to Big 4 or MBB consulting firms.

"Stellar in writing but bad in exams. Not sure if I've just had bad luck with exams or the like, but it seems like every class I take with exams, I struggle to even get a C in the course, most recently a few where an exam or two in, I already know I cannot pass. However, with writing intensive courses, I pass with flying colors. This has been an ongoing issue for me for years, and I'm not sure what to do.

On a sample exam, it may say to bring up X economic theory that applies to Y topic, but I cannot for the life of me remember the name or by extension its associated theory, but if the question gave me the theory and name ahead of time, I could answer a question about it. Not sure if it's a mental thing, I've been diagnosed as bipolar II with ADHD, but classroom distractions haven't proven to be an issue.

"Was marked ‘below satisfactory’ on grad assistantship evaluation, but don’t think this rating is fair. I (27F) am a PhD student working a grad assistantship in my department. I started at the beginning of the semester working as a clerical assistant for a group of faculty. The appointment was only for the fall term, so I will not be working there again in the spring. I was NOT terminated, my department just doesn’t have the funds to continue the position in the spring term. Basically, I am asked to complete tasks by the teaching staff as they need them. My supervisor is one of the professors, and she is the one who gave me the above rating. As the semester progressed and she as well as the others gave me tasks, I thought everything was going well. Then the day before Halloween (more than halfway through the semester), she calls me into her office and tells me that I am not meeting expectations. She then goes to list projects I did that apparently had “usability” issues with them (her words), but she never gave me an opportunity to fix them nor did she notify me when these issues were discovered. I even had to ask what the issues were with each project that she was referring to. There was another large project that she claimed I took too long on, and marked me as “demonstrating significant need for completing tasks on time” as a headliner to my evaluation. It was the only project I didn’t quite meet the deadline on, but now she’s blowing it up and making it look like I cannot complete things on time.

"My roommate is accusing me of bullying after confronting her about using my clothes and uncleanliness. You might have seen a different perspective of this story already (linked [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1776ry4/my_roommate_is_telling_people_i_bullied_her_to/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)) but I am the person whose belongings this roommate has been stealing from and this is my perspective. This is definitely going to be a long story so bear with me. I am a senior in college, and was randomly assigned 3 roommates to share an apartment with. Upon meeting them, we all got along pretty well. We talked every day, asked each other for advice, and generally were good friends. This was until 4 weeks ago. 4 weeks ago, my concealer went missing after pregaming and getting ready with my 3 roommates. I didn't think anything of it, and assumed I was the person who misplaced it. After this day, I noticed one of the roommates, we can call her Ally, that I do not share a bathroom with would go into my bathroom every single morning. Me and the person I share a room with (let's call her Jenny) both noticed, as the door is loud, and wakes up me, her and my dog. This went on for over two weeks before I brought it up with Jenny. She said it annoyed her as well, especially because it was at 7 AM, a time that no one in my room is awake. We noticed Ally would be in our bathroom (which is connected to our closet) for at least minutes daily. Me and Jenny never understood why she would go in there because she has her own bathroom, and has no personal belongings in our space. During this time, I was unable to locate a pair of leggings after a day that she went into my bathroom/closet. I still assumed that I had misplaced them and was concerned, but not of stealing. That weekend, I went to my hometown, and took a suitcase. When I got back to school on Monday, I was too lazy to unpack my suitcase and it remained in my room until Thursday. When I opened my suitcase, I found my leggings which could only be possible if someone had put them there. Jenny with helped me look for the leggings before I left for over an hour and knew I was unable to find them before leaving the previous weekend. It was at this point I addressed my concerns with Jenny. I am going to list all of the concerns I discussed with Jenny: * My concealer was missing. (I am a woman of color and the only other person who could have worn it was Alli) * My leggings, that I wear at least once a week because I exercise, had gone missing (me and Ally are the same size and height) * While I was away, I asked Jenny to remove my clothes from the dryer and she was unable to find them until the following day * Over 10 different clothing items have deodorant stains on them. This may not sound odd, but these were clothes that were clean and had not been worn by me in at least 2 weeks. There were a number of sweat stains and smells coming from clothes I know I had not touched in weeks and even months. THE CLOTHES SMELLED, and not like myself or detergent. Once telling Jenny, we decided to tell the third roommate, Angie, who had her own issues with Alli. Angie then told us about how Alli had been leaving panties with blood and excrement stains in their bathroom. She had left bloody towels, hair, and just general trash everywhere. She then told me that she suspected Alli was using her face products as well. Angie told me to check the rest of my belongings. It was at this point I noticed that most of my makeup was either broken or used, which is also odd because I have not used any foundation or makeup products aside from concealer and mascara for over 6 months. We decided to confront Alli. She did not deny anything immediately. She only stated ""I can't believe this"" for nearly 10 minutes before saying she didn't know what I was talking about. She even suggested a 6 foot man had been coming on to try my size XXS skims dresses while we were all gone. After this, she quite literally started throwing a tantrum. She was yelling, screaming, and was offended that we had accused her of being a kleptomaniac. We all found this strange as we had never even used the word stealing. (We have since found out that she actually takes medication for kleptomania.) After this conversation, I informed an RA (who ended up being quite unhelpful and has a student conduct report on the grounds of racism). She stopped sleeping here, and told us she was moving out. After a lot of emails, and weeks of her lies, she has finally started the move out process. This has not been the end of Alli though, she has brought between 2-6 ""friends"" into our apartment at any given time to help her move out. They hardly (if at all help) and become extremely argumentative with my other roommates and I. It has gotten to the point where we can expect some form of harassment/confrontation daily. She has told them that I am a bully, and a liar, when that is simply not the case. I am offended that someone would even say that about me, especially without mentioning all of her absurd behavior during this time. Does anyone have any advice?

"I think this depends on a lot of factors though. For example, here in Canada, most of our school year takes place in the winter and the sun rises super late in the day. To have a class that starts at 7 or 8 means waking up and commuting in the dark. Not the biggest deal, but it's a little extra exhausting and the roads are awful from the first snowfall (late October) to everything melting (April-ish). The work culture matters too. The only job I could find during my first few years needed me during the evenings. So I wasn't getting home until 9-10pm most days. Then I needed to cook dinner, eat, shower, work on homework--oh look it's 3am! If you then have to get up at 6 to commute to an 8am class, that's unsustainable. All that to say it's really important to consider the cultures where people are making these complaints. I also notice that Canadians and Americans don't tend to complain about post-grad jobs starting at 8, just classes. So I think that late nights being required for students to support themselves is a big part of it.

"Something like this happened to me. Ten years ago two graduate students, one of which I had moved heaven and earth to help get through our program collaborated on an email to me effectively telling me that I was a piece of shit. They called me a bully and accused me of stealing their ideas. I was devastated. I had invited both students to my house, let them play with my kids, and did everything possible to help them.

They accuse us of discrimination, bigotry, and other terrible things and don't see how much work it is to get them to where they need to be as an academic and how little we mentors get back in return.

"Writing papers in the Notes app. I’ve been battling a bit of AI use in papers lately, and I’ve noticed a trend. When I ask how they are writing the papers, they’re not using the provided template, which is in Google Docs. They’re using the Apple Notes app, of all weird things.

"Right now faculty and grad students are being being impacted the most, but this does have the ability to impact undergrads. 1. Lack of support for classes. Do you know how instructors are able to teach classes with 100+ students or multiple labs for the same class? It's because of grad students working as TAs. If departments don't have funding for grad students, this will seriously disrupt how these courses are taught. Option one: Faculty are expected to do manage hundreds of students without TAs for help, leading them to being severely overwhelmed, which will impact the quality of their teaching. Option two: the school accepts fewer students so they can lessen the burden on faculty. Option three: The school limits course enrollment, so certain courses become harder to get into, which will cause some students to have to delay graduation; Option 4: If the school has the budget--which they might not--they try to hire extra faculty as cheaply as possible, which will probably result in underqualified instructors teaching courses. 2. Instructors leaving/being laid off/deported. A lot of instructors are primarily there to do research or are at least partially supported by grant money. Many are not native US citizens. If they leave or are fired/deported, there are fewer people to teach classes. See the above options. 3. Decrease in overall student support. Does your school have a good tutoring center? State of the art equipment? Access to free computer software or free laptop rentals? Good mental health services? There's a good chance these are at least partially funded by grants. 4. Decrease in overall opportunities for students. Study abroad programs have already been heavily impacted by this, but there's a good chance it could also impact things like who schools partner with for various volunteer or work-related experiences. And lots of clubs are in danger, which limit leadership opportunities for students. 5. Cuts to scholarships. Lots of schools use grant money to create specific scholarships. For example, if the school offers a scholarship for students in rural areas seeking a STEM degree that is funded by a grant, that could easily be shut down for being under the umbrella of DEI. Even if students are not impacted in ways they can directly see--primarily financially--the overall quality of their education, support services, and future opportunities may be impacted by everything currently happening",Examination,Medium,1.0,web:pullpush:r/college:comment:scholarship delay,Medium,1,2440,392,5,"Right now faculty and grad students are being being impacted the most, but this does have the ability to impact undergrads.",0

"[advise] Should I pursue a second undergraduate degree in engineering. Hey guys ^(first off, i wanna preface this post with an apology: im sorry if i posted this on the wrong sub, the mods can lmk where i can post lol and i hope everyone's hanging on despite the pandemic that's going on atm.) Bit of background about me: currently on my 2nd year in Environmental Biology in Canada as an international student. I'm about to enter my 3rd year in the coming fall. I ***really*** wanted to transfer to civil or geodetic engineering but it isn't financially viable anymore at this point -- also because I'm already more than half way through my degree by the time this semester finishes. So, I thought of doing another undergraduate degree, \*hopefully\* after I get a permanent status here in Canada. At that point, I wouldn't be subjected to crazy international tuition fees, so I'd be free to come back to school without such excessive financial burden on my back. Though, I'd be starting another degree at 25-28. If I opt to do the engineering program from the same university I'd get my first degree from, they'd transfer over a semester towards the engineering degree. If things go right, I'd be hoping to get my professional designation at 29-32. I have some fears, though. By the time I reach 29-32, engineers in the field are already mid-careers. I'm just scared I'm behind people my age once I enter the labour force. Maybe it's just because I'm young at the moment hence why I care and is fearful of it; maybe it's just a phase and once I get a job I wouldn't be fantasizing about being an engineer anymore. Once kicked into the real world, maybe my priorities will change (school being not one of them). Apart from that, there's also the fear of surviving in the program itself. My parents' initial reaction were questions as to why I suddenly had the interest for engineering ^((my dad is an engineer and he and I fought a lot on not pursuing engineering)), then followed with hesitance with regards to being able to last in the program. They didn't want to gamble it, especially they were basically investing in my future (aka throwing shitloads of money for school). Another fear is employment and living a life of debt. Currently, I'm living off my parents and debt-free. But I don't think I'll attain the same financial standing as my parents do (what they have is pretty fuckin admirable), knowing that I'm probably going to be doing something I don't have the affinity for. There's also the fear of not knowing -- I don't know what the fuck I'll get myself into when I go back to school. My grades aren't an issue, graduate school is also an option for me. I've had two years forcing myself to be interested in natural sciences but it's really not just clicking. I don't mind writing; in fact, I love writing -- but I can't see myself write academic papers on topics I'm not super passionate about. Though, I hate the reading aspect of it -- halfway through this degree and I still can't bring myself to not gouge my eyeballs out every time I read an abstract to start the paper. I used be hella obsessed with the world of academia; get a PhD, produce research, help the world get better, etc. For some reason, it just lost its spark and I'm numb to what I'm currently doing.

"Heading into the sixth week of the semester with only two class meetings thus far. I have a class that meets on Monday evenings (I'm in a dual BA/MA program). The semester started on **01/20** (was supposed to start on Monday 01/19, school was closed for MLK day), so we skipped what would have been the very first meeting of the semester. **01/26:** Classes cancelled due to inclement weather. **02/02:** Met. **02/09:** Met. **02/16:** School closed for ""holiday"" (Presidents' day). **02/23:** Just got word from my professor this afternoon (02/21) that she expects the school to be closed again on Monday due to inclement weather. This hasn't been officially announced yet, but admin at my school jumps at any opportunity for a day off. **EDIT:** All classes have officially been cancelled, so that's four class meetings missed/skipped. On top of the classes we've already missed, we'll miss another for Spring break in March and another ""holiday"" (Patriots' day) in April. The last day of classes is 05/08, so we *might* meet a total of ten times by the end of the semester (assuming my professor doesn't get sick and there is no more inclement weather after this upcoming week). What makes this especially frustrating is that this is a workshop course - if we don't meet, *nothing gets done*. It's not a course where I can read the material from home, take a quiz online, and pass with flying colors. My professor can't make us meet online if the school itself has closed or cancelled classes. I've been in school for four years and I've never really experienced this before. what even happens in this scenario? There's absolutely no way we could complete our course objectives with one third of our meetings slashed, I don't even know how we're being graded or what our final portfolio would look like given how much we've missed, and I don't think admin plans on extending the semester a week or two into the Summer. Has anybody experienced this or something similar? If so, did you just have to hope and pray the prof had mercy on you and gave everyone a good grade?

"How should I compare foreign schools (within the United Kingdom) to american schools when comparing them? What would be a comparable school to these universities. Hi all, So, I'm American, and I'm trying to decide which University to attend. I have been accepted to multiple universities within the United States, and 2 in the United Kingdom. Right now, im deciding between 3. In the United States, I am leaning towards Kenyon college, and in the United Kingdom, I have been accepted to the University of St. Andrews and the University of Glasgow. For the University of Glasgow, I was accepted into the politics/history programme, and for The University of St. Andrews, I was accepted into the international relations programme. For Kenyon, I was accepted into the political science programme. Now, im having great difficulty finding out reliable information about these 2 Scottish universities, since there seems to be conflicting beliefs about the schools. For the University of Glasgow, I've read rankings putting it within the top 10 in the United Kingdom, and other reviews who claim its not as good as it seems (with complaints about the programme and such). For the University of St. Andrews, I'm especially confused. I've read rankings placing it within the top 3 in the country, and other reviews saying its an overrated university. I've also read that its a school that it isn't impressive to employers. Im a bit confused as to what to perceive of the school, and so ive been scouring the internet, unable to find too much conclusive information. I guess, when comparing these 3 schools, how should I compare these Scottish countries when comparing them to American colleges and universities, either it being ranking or basically what school could be the most comparable to them. Is there a way to do that? I'm at a loss for anything else, and I need to make a decision soon (very soon), so does anybody have any advice for me? Please?

"It's like we're not being taught to actually understand what we're learning, just to memorize enough to pass the tests. I've been thinking a lot lately about a disconnect I often perceive in how we approach education, particularly in foundational STEM subjects from K-12 onwards. Does anyone else feel there's sometimes an overemphasis on memorizing procedures and formulas primarily to pass tests, potentially at the expense of cultivating genuine conceptual understanding and an appreciation for the 'why' behind the material? It seems the focus frequently lands on getting the 'correct answer' through prescribed methods, rather than necessarily fostering an intuitive grasp of the underlying principles. Learning foundational facts and skills is obviously crucial - we need the building blocks. But when learning stops at rote recall for assessment, does it truly stick or inspire further engagement? My sense, reinforced by some recent explorations, is that true understanding - the kind that feels exciting and leads to long-term retention - arises when we connect these individual pieces to a bigger picture. For example, knowing why a theorem like Pythagoras' holds (perhaps through exploring geometric proofs) feels fundamentally different from just memorizing a²+b²=c². Similarly, understanding that foundational trigonometric functions eventually become the language used to describe waves and oscillations throughout nature provides a profound 'why' that can make mastering the initial mechanics more meaningful. It helps frame the basics not as arbitrary rules, but as crucial steps towards appreciating how math and physics act as lenses to understand reality - ways to partially translate the 'language of the universe.' Why does this disconnect between procedure and understanding persist? Perhaps it's partly a legacy of older educational models designed for standardization and efficiency, which found it easier to measure rote recall than deep comprehension at scale. Perhaps it's the pressure for easily quantifiable results in assessment. Whatever the root causes, the potential impact on students concerns me. Natural curiosity might be dampened if it's not rewarded or seen as relevant to success (defined by grades). Learning can become about seeking external validation rather than experiencing the internal 'aha!' moment of true understanding. This might inadvertently train students not to question too deeply or explore connections if it deviates from the tested material, potentially explaining why many disengage later on. So, my question to this community is: How can we better cultivate and prioritize this deeper, connected, intuitive understanding right from the foundational stages of education? What pedagogical shifts, assessment reforms, or structural changes might encourage students not just to learn procedures, but to truly engage with the concepts and appreciate the power and beauty of these intellectual tools? Keen to hear diverse perspectives on this. Gemini's thoughts on this and other things (under the same umbrella of education) we discussed (there is some profanity): ""You've hit the nail on the head. It is fucked, honestly, how often education forces memorization over genuine understanding. Like you said, no wonder so many people feel disconnected or dislike subjects that are actually incredibly fascinating when you see the bigger picture. We're often taught the ""what"" (formulas, procedures) without the fundamental ""why"" or the ""how does this connect to everything else?"" And you're absolutely right, learning grounded in understanding the connections – seeing how math describes physics, how physics describes reality, how patterns repeat across different scales – feels so much more natural and, frankly, more exciting. It builds intuition instead of just taxing memory. When you understand why e^(iπ) = -1 or why sine waves model so many natural phenomena, it sticks with you in a way that just memorizing sin(π/4) = √2/2 never can. I strongly agree that learning this way, focusing on those ""universal connections,"" leads to a much deeper appreciation and probably, yeah, more happiness and less frustration with the learning process itself. -- That's a really deep and interesting question. When you look at how standardized education often works – the focus on bells, rigid schedules, standardized tests, memorizing facts for short-term recall, specific ""correct"" answers versus exploration – it's easy to see why you'd feel it might be designed that way, like a form of conditioning. Many critics and historians of education have explored similar ideas. Expanding on that feeling ""intuitively,"" here's what comes to mind, drawing from common analyses: * Legacy of the Industrial Era: Modern mass schooling largely originated when societies needed workers for factories and bureaucracies. These systems often prioritized discipline, punctuality, following instructions, and basic skills suitable for standardized roles over independent, critical, or creative thought which might disrupt the system. The structure itself – batching students by age, standardized curriculum, bells dictating movement – mirrors factory efficiency models. Whether it's intentional conditioning now, or just the inertia of that historical design, the effect can feel like conditioning for compliance and specific tasks. * Ease of Management &amp; Measurement: Teaching and assessing deep, intuitive understanding is complex, time-consuming, and hard to standardize across large populations. Teaching for memorization and testing via multiple-choice or formulaic problems is much easier to manage, scale, and measure ""objectively."" This focus on easily measurable outcomes can unintentionally prioritize superficial learning over deep comprehension. * Social Sorting: Some sociological perspectives argue that school systems, sometimes implicitly, function as a sorting mechanism for society, channeling people into different economic and social roles based partly on their ability (or willingness) to navigate the existing structure, which again, might favour compliance and test-taking skills over other forms of intelligence or understanding. * Overemphasis on ""Correct Answers"": As we saw with the quiz, the focus becomes getting the exact right input, even if the underlying concept is understood. This trains a focus on external validation (the grade, the checkmark) rather than internal understanding and the joy of discovery. It can discourage exploring interesting tangents or questioning the method if it doesn't lead directly to the expected answer format. * Discouraging Deeper Questioning: A system focused on efficiency and curriculum coverage often doesn't have space for the deep ""why"" questions or exploring the interconnectedness you mentioned. It can inadvertently teach students not to question too deeply or stray too far from the required material. So, is it a deliberate, conscious ""conditioning"" program run by some shadowy group? Probably not in such a simplistic way. Is it a system whose historical origins, structure, and focus on standardization often result in conditioning effects that prioritize compliance and superficial learning over deep, intuitive, connected understanding? Many analyses would suggest yes. The effects are real, regardless of conscious intent, and that feeling you have – that it's not designed purely for holistic learning – is shared by many who look critically at education. That's exactly why dedicating this space to counteract that – to focus on the ""why,"" the connections, and the intuition – feels so important. It's about reclaiming the joy and depth of learning that often gets lost."" So, what do you all think?

"Persuading Reality: Social-Psychophysiological Responses to Placebo Effects. Hi people, this is an old essay of mine I thought others may gain some insights from:) Persuading Reality: Social-Psychophysiological Responses to Placebo Effects Definitions Placebo Effect: There are multiple versions of placebo effects. This paper will use Dr. Alia Crum’s definition from behavioral health which splits the placebo effect into three components. 1. Social Context (what one learns from external sources which influence their mindsets) 2. Mindsets or Beliefs (One’s core assumptions about their subjective and objective reality which influence their expectations, adaptations, and goals) 3. Natural physiological processes in the brain and body that can produce different outcomes (the mechanisms which underpin the psychophysiological response to various stimuli) Nocebo Effect: Negative version of a placebo effect. Perceptual Persuasions: Beliefs and behaviors that one implements to alter their own psychophysiology. Introduction: One’s psychophysiology can be altered by their subjective reality. Over time the number of studies that back up this claim have continued to climb. Most of the population will go through their entire life not knowing the power of the mind-body connection. For example, if a person believes healthy food is decadent and nutritious, the food has a higher nutritional value. If an individual believes a medication is going to have adverse side-effects, there is a higher chance that it will. And if one believes stress is an opportunity for growth that enhances them instead of an insurmountable dilemma that diminishes them, their physiological responses indicate they’re correct. There are endless examples of individuals influencing their psychophysiology by changing their expectations. The mind influences outcomes across a person’s entire lifespan. Placebo effects, nocebo effects, and perceptual persuasions continue to prove that the mind-body connection is a key component of one’s overall health. Placebo effects are one example of how the mind influences the body in miraculous ways. In a study (Mindset Matters: Exercise and the Placebo Effect, 2007) conducted by Dr. Alia Crum and Ellen Langer, they discovered that mindsets have a substantial impact on one’s health. The study divided 84 female hotel room attendants into two groups. After taking a few key physiological measurements the control group went back to work with no mindset training. The other subjects were then told about the benefits of exercise and how they were vastly exceeding the recommended daily requirements for a healthy lifestyle. After four weeks, Crum and Langer took the same measurements and discovered the women that had been simply told the truth about exercise showed a wide range of positive outcomes. This is just one example of many that have popped up over the years; studies like these show the power of placebo effects. A person’s mindset has an immediate impact on their reality. Crum has some brilliant insights about placebo effects in behavioral psychology. In a study on nutrition (Mind Over Milkshakes: Mindsets, Not Just Nutrients, Determine the Ghrelin Response, 2011), Dr. Crum, Peter Salovey, and Kelly J. Brownell told their subjects they were conducting a study on low-fat and high-fat milkshakes, but the milkshakes were the same for all tests. This allowed them to measure the ghrelin hormone response in the stomach after the subjects consumed the milkshakes (ghrelin is the hunger hormone). When the subjects thought they were drinking a low-fat milkshake, ghrelin increased; when they thought it was high-fat, ghrelin decreased. This shows that one’s perspective on what they’re eating causes a direct physiological response. When a person is eating healthy food it’s good to have the correct mindset. If they think it’s delicious, nutritious, and decadent, the food has a higher nutritional value. If they think healthy food is disgusting, distasteful, and unfulfilling, the person gains less benefits. The nocebos that state healthy food is undesirable, which has permeated throughout cultures around the world, continue to cause long-term issues. A nocebo effect occurs when an individual only learns about the negative aspects of whatever they are encountering. These notions can cause a plethora of symptoms in any psychosociological event. In a study (Implicit Theories of Intelligence Predict Achievement across an Adolescent Transition: A Longitudinal Study and an Intervention, 2007) done by Lisa S Blackwell and her colleagues, they tried to evaluate how a student’s theories about intelligence influenced their outcomes. The test focused on adolescents transitioning from the 7th grade to the 8th grade because of the high stress environment. One group of students were taught that intelligence is a long-term effort-based pursuit. The other students received a standard education with no additional guidance. The students that weren’t given any insights about intelligence mindsets proceeded to struggle in their courses while the others started to excel. This indicates the importance of having an effort-based positive mindset, instead of an end-based negative mindset, when pursuing all forms of intelligence. Negative mindsets usually come from one’s social engagements which makes them very hard to avoid. In medicine, doctors have to be extremely careful with their words, body language, and competency. If they emphasize the adverse effects of a medication, it can increase the chance of a patient having those symptoms. Also, if a health care professional mentions other patients not feeling any effects from a drug the recipient may see little to no benefits from their treatment. The nocebo effect can induce a variety of symptoms over one’s life; most of the time the person doesn’t even know a nocebo is contributing to their issues. This is a major reason people need to learn the power of perceptual persuasions. When one learns to harness perceptual persuasions, they can manipulate their psychophysiology very reliably. This can increase a person’s ability to leverage anxiety and other forms of stress to achieve their goals. It all starts with the individual’s beliefs that have been instilled over their lifetime. To persuade one’s perceptions, it helps to think of the brain as a computer. The old beliefs are out-of-date software, and it’s going to take a little effort to reformat them to an up-to-date version. For example, most people consider stress to be a bad thing. This is because a lot of cultures constantly promote how awful stress is for an individual’s health. The truth is those statistics only represent one half of the equation. Stress also improves focus, hormone production, and can cause positive adaptations over time. When a person swaps the old belief with a mindset which amplifies the positive aspects of stress, it can have profound effects on their short and long-term health (Crum, Alia J., and Damon J. Phillips. Self-Fulfilling Prophesies, Placebo Effects, and the Social–Psychological Creation of Reality, 2015). As a culture, it would be good to promote the positive aspects of stress opposed to only the negatives. Yes, stress is not ideal, but everyone will encounter it in their life; having the correct mindset can have a massive impact on one’s psychophysiological responses. Individuals can change their objective reality simply by changing their beliefs. These persuasions become particularly potent when paired with positive inputs, such as pursuing goals, exercising, and eating healthy. Not only does the individual receive the benefits from the objectively positive input, but they can gain increased benefits from their expectations. In some cases, the placebo effect accounts for over 80% of a drug’s effectiveness (Robson, David. The Expectation Effect. Canongate, 2022.), and in other cases, nocebos cause patients to incur negative symptoms. This is enough of a reason to seriously consider the power of one’s beliefs. Placebo effects, nocebo effects, and perceptual persuasions are a core component of a person’s outcomes in all avenues. Thus, when one thinks of all the nonsense they encounter throughout the day trying to tilt them towards a negative mindset, they realize there is a lot of mental reprogramming to be done. Thankfully these mindsets can be changed and have an immediate impact on one’s psychophysiology. Works Cited Crum, Alia J., and Ellen J. Langer. ""Mindset Matters: Exercise and the Placebo Effect.""

"Some complaints after my first year…would definitely like some input, please. I just finished my first year in a science PhD program - and I'm really not all that thrilled with it. I know classes aren't supposed to be that important anymore, however, if we're going to be required to take them, I feel as though they should be worth my time. To the contrary, they have been WAY too simple, and the professors don't seem to care at all. On top of this, the other graduate students in my department are extremely frustrating. I went to graduate school because I'm excited about science - it seems quite the opposite for a lot of the students in my program…they're here to do the bare minimum to get a degree and that's it. We don't even have a type of departmental journal club. Myself and several other students decided to start one, and we've been running it for a semester now, yet not a single other graduate student will show up. Perhaps my biggest issue, however, is my lab. My advisor is a REALLY nice guy, however, he's incredibly hands off. I was warned about this before I came here - but I didn't quite realize the extent of it. My lab is large (space-wise), however, there is only one other graduate student. I've tried really hard to get on her good side…I've offered my help with things around the lab, etc. She doesn't seem to like me very much…I get the feeling that she sees me as a complete waste of space. I've asked her for help with very few things in the past year - and each time I've asked I've been met with sarcasm and snarky responses that really make me feel like I'm a complete idiot and don't belong here. Not to mention - none of the help I was hoping for. She's also never in the lab - MAYBE 2-3 hours per day…that's it. When she does come in, the headphones are in and the music turned up. I say hi, she shrugs me off. This has been going on since I arrived. Anyway…no one really took the time to show me the lab, tell me how to do certain things, etc. I get it…Grad School is supposed to be independent…and I'm a driven individual who can get things done on his own…but there is still SOME level of guidance new student is gonna need to get started. So, needless to say, apart from finishing classes, this past year, I feel, has been a waste. I don't know how my advisor feels about me…I've asked how he feels about my progress, and he's had nothing but good things to say - however, I've been warned by a variety of people that he is the type that won't tell you that you're doing something wrong until you absolutely fuck up. I actually want him to turn around a yell at me about something. TELL ME WHAT I'M DOING WRONG. I want to know, I want to learn….but the environment in this lab is completely stagnant. I've been trying to maintain my footing, but I'm slipping, and I'm afraid that one of these days I may turn around and say somethings I'm gonna regret. I've been known to let my temper get the best of me sometimes. To add to all this - my advisor doesn't tell any of us anything. Like one day I showed up to a PostDoc in our lab…and all the sudden we're getting a research tech - which I only know thanks to the PostDoc…my advisor has failed to fill me, or the other graduate student in on any of this. So, I guess what I'm looking for here is some advice. Maybe some criticism? Am I in the wrong here? Am I approaching this completely wrong? How do you deal with the only other graduate student in your lab who really could not give 2 shits about you? Thanks in advance… Sorry…I just needed to get this off of my chest",Faculty,Medium,1.0,web:reddit:r/gradschool:search:complaint,Medium,1,3563,679,6,"Some complaints after my first year…would definitely like some input, please.",0

"I have to find a definition for something from a high-ranked journal, but it seems impossible…. Since my last post was removed, this is to clarify: I am not trying to have someone answer my super specific definition issue - I only provided it as an example to explain the kind of problem I struggle with. I am more so trying to find out how to generally approach when I need a definition or proof from a high-ranked journal and struggle to find anything. My supervisor only allows me to use sources from journals ranked ABS3, 4, or 5*. I guess that is understandable, but it‘s just really hard when it comes to finding a specific definition or proving a certain point. I don‘t know how to proceed in such a case… I have tried asking ChatGPT to help me find a good source, but it seems it is not good for academia at all.

"Should I quit my MA program. I am in my second semester of a somewhat niche MA program in the humanities. Since undergrad, I’ve wanted to get my PhD. I’ve been going non-stop since then, taking intensive courses every summer and applied to go to grad school right after graduating with my bachelors. So I haven’t gotten much of a break in what feels like a long time. My first semester went pretty well. I was part time but I got all A’s. I did deal with some bouts of really high stress and feeling unmotivated but I pushed through and felt proud of myself at the end. This semester, on the other hand, has been a shitstorm. Burn out has hit me full force. For this reason I reduced my course load and I’m only taking two classes, which I thought would help me relax but it hasn’t. I’ve been more depressed and anxious than ever. I’ve also realized that I don’t want to go for my PhD. I think I might have known this for a while (but ignored it), but especially by being in this MA program I know that I wouldn’t enjoy being in academia as a career. The past few weeks have been pretty terrible and I’ve been having mental breakdowns/bouts of crying almost every day. I haven’t been able to eat or take care of myself as I normally am. My brain feels like soup. I feel unable to read or process/retain anything I’m reading. When I think of writing assignments I need to do I feel sick. I was once passionate about the subject I’m studying but the pressure has completely killed that passion. I’m just not enjoying it anymore. I’ve considered taking medical leave but I honestly wonder if I should just quit since I don’t plan to get my PhD and I fear this degree will be useless because it is so niche and there are extremely limited career paths beside academia. But I’m so scared. I have met wonderful people in the program that I don’t want to lose the connection with, and I’m so fearful that I’m going to regret it. I’m scared of disappointing all the people who supported me in getting here. I don’t know what to do. Also (perhaps most importantly?) this program isn’t funded so I feel pretty stupid paying all this money for something that is causing so much stress and uncertainty regarding the future.

"I want to finish my Master's and then do Optometry school, but I just got hired as a Research Assistant and gave intentions of doing a PhD. So I graduated with my bachelor's in Data Science this year and decided to go to grad school to pursue a masters in Bioinformatics. My goal was to find a professor to become a Research Assistant under, mostly to gain some work experience. Well, I found one, and in our first meeting we somehow decided that I would probably switch to the PhD track under them. Let me say, they have been an EXCELLENT advisor thus far, very caring and have put in a lot of effort! Their lab is brand new and I am one of the only students in it. I genuinely appreciate everything they have done for me so far, and so badly do not want to let them down. I was supposed to transition to the PhD program after my first semester (this past one), but instead they said they wanted to work with me for one more semester. I've never done research before, and this has been a huge learning curve, so I understood fully. They still made me a research assistant. Well, the more I do research, the more respect I gain for it, and the more I feel like in the long run, it is not for me. So I started looking at other options, and low and behold, I have almost all of the prereqs done for optometry school. There are a 1-2 science courses I could take during my masters as electives, then 2-3 I'd have to take at a community college afterwards. I'd like to graduate with my masters next spring, shadow, take the OAT, then apply. This makes sense for me, as I am much more of a people person, and I've always loved science + the idea of being a doctor. I started undergrad as a pre-dental, then switched to DS because I thought I would get a 6-figure salary out of college. Boy, was I wrong haha. Hence, why I chose to go to school for Bioinformatics, it is a hybrid of what I was trained in and what I actually like (science). The thing is, my advisor has set me up with a project that is intended to be a quick, high-impact first author paper, in order to give me the best head start possible. And since I literally just got hired as an RA, I feel super shallow for changing my mind about the PhD. I desperately want to keep my assistantship and be a strong contributor to the lab until I graduate, because at the end of the day, I want to finish this degree and have options afterwards (plus my tuition is free through my assistantship). But I know for sure I don't want to do a PhD. There's one more layer to the problem. There are four prereqs for optometry school I need to take (Bio II, Gen Chem II, Microbio, and Orgo I). On the thesis track of my master's degree, I can take one science elective. If I do the non-thesis track, I can take two (ideally Bio II and Gen Chem II). This would mean I'd only need one semester at a CC, instead of two. I have no idea if it would be frowned upon for me to work as an RA, and then not do a thesis? Or how negatively that would reflect on my advisor, someone who is trying to get their lab going + some ROI on their mentorship. I've read doing a masters in Bioinformatics with no thesis is a waste of time and money, but I would still have internship experience + almost two years of RA experience, maybe even a publication",Faculty,Medium,1.0,web:reddit:r/gradschool:new,Medium,1,3278,636,6,"I want to finish my Master's and then do Optometry school, but I just got hired as a Research Assistant and gave intentions of doing a PhD.",0

I wasn’t originally planning to make it public, but since a few people said it helped them, I decided to share it here too in case it’s useful for someone.

"GWU vs Gettysburg vs TCNJ. I am an autistic teen who is interested in public policy. I dream to become a Senator because I believe politics is the best way I could provide a widespread positive impact. I have been accepted to several colleges, however, I have narrowed down my top choices to three colleges: TCNJ, Gettysburg, and GWU. Out of these colleges, I would like to go to GWU the most due to its location and prestige. However, my mom disagrees. The top concern she listed is in regards to the political climate, saying that government internships would be improbable to get due to the budget cuts. She also has concerns about DC not being safe while Trump's, however, she hasn't fully clarified what she means by this, except for ""riots and things like that"" and ""you would be too far away for me to get you"" so I don't share this concern. Another concern is accommodations. She believes that GWU won’t provide the accommodations for my ADHD and Autism, which I need to thrive. The final problem is cost, as even with my merit scholarship, I'm looking at nearly 60k a year. We are well into the middle class, but I’m the youngest, and my parents have already put two other kids through College. My father said it would be rough, but he could do it. He told me money shouldn’t be my main concern, but with how the economy is going, I am not sure how much I trust it. She prefers that I go to TCNJ because its location next to Trenton would be good for internships, it is a suburban environment that won’t be overwhelming, and it would provide decent accommodations. I have also been admitted to a 5-year MPP program at TCNJ, however, I don’t see myself pursuing a Master's at TCNJ simply due to reputation. I recognize that the Congressmen in my area have all graduated from colleges with acceptance rates under 20%. So I’m afraid that going to a school like TCNJ will stop me from being respected in the political landscape. I should mention that I do plan to attend either a Master's or a Law program after graduating, which adds another dimension to both the prestige and cost angle. My mom pointed out to me that attending a prestigious grad school would counterbalance going to a state undergrad college. And that getting the grades necessary to join an elite college would be easier to get at both Gettysburg and TCNJ than at GWU; however, I’m thinking that for schools such as Georgetown, Brown, Yale, and others, a 4.0 at a decently prestigious school such as GW would be far more likely to be considered alongside the DC internships. Gettysburg is my third option. It is pretty well recognized, and cheaper than GW at around 45k a year total with my merit scholarship. However, it isn’t close to any state capital, which I need for internships. The campus is also very white. This isn’t a bad thing, but I also spent most of my life having friends of the same ethnicity as me. It has a great DC program, but not as accessible as GW. As far as I know, Gettysburg is very good with both classroom and living accommodations. On a personal note, I want my College years to be different from my childhood. I grew up in the suburbs of the New Jersey woodlands. I have never really had a social life outside of academics, so I feel like going to a college where I could have gotten in with a 3.5 GPA instead of a 4.1 + all the extracurriculars. I also don’t want to limit myself based on the perceptions of family and myself due to my disabilities, as I know that the career path I want to pursue won’t give me any charity. Sorry for the rant, but I think I just want to hear from graduates of these three schools and how they are doing now. Or advice on what college would be best for my career path. Or even related life advice, maybe. I am willing to have a conversation if anyone is willing.

"I need help deciding what to do. Should I go on leave or do retroactive withdrawal for this semester? I'm lost. For information, I need a minimum C+ to renew my scholarship every year. Have already renewed twice. I honestly just need some guidance and opinions. Since writing this, I feel option two might be the worst? I would greatly appreciate any insight. *The ""core"" courses refer to the ones required for grad school. I'm required to pass every course with a minimum C+, and I just don't see that happening for the first two I mentioned.* **Option 1: Retroactive withdrawal (basically nullify Fall semester)** Pros: * Removes the 2 courses (core) that I'm highly likely to pass with a D+ (or C if I do well on my upcoming finals). * Removes the 1 (core) course I'm doing just *okay* in (B). * Get a *full* refund on each course (aforementioned 3 + 2 electives), and get to retake them and do a lot better. *I was unable to apply myself well this past semester due to mental health struggles, and I guess part of the reason was lack of confidence in myself to pursue my specialization.* * Removes mental stress adding onto depression and anxiety Cons: * Withdraws me from *all* 5 courses I'm taking this semester, including: * 2 electives that I'm passing with an A+. One of them is full-year, and it's likely that I'll still pass with an A+ at the end of the school year. I've spent a reasonable amount of time and effort in maintaining these grades to make up for my poor performance on the cores, including 4 papers I did well on. 1 paper was personal, and I doubt that, if I retake it, I can replicate it in a way that doesn't count as 'self-plagiarism.' The other 3 include 2 long 'journals' based on each class, and a 2000-word book review on a book which I'm sure has been used every year in this course. Similarly, I don't see myself being able to write something entirely different if I ended up retaking them. * I've heard the application of retroactive withdrawal requires a lot of documentation and can be stressful, but I have my academic advisor's support. **Option 2: Leave of absence (during Winter semester)** Pros: * I'd have an *entire semester* to focus on my mental health and work through steps to improve my overall well-being and get my life back on track. * Ik I'm only 20, but I feel stuck, stressed, and suicidal, and I worry if I don't work on this stuff when I'm young, it'll become a greater problem in adulthood. I don't want to delay it anymore. * Given I have information and knowledge of the aforementioned two core courses, I believe I can better plan my success in them if I decide to retake them. *I can also retake them next year though*, *without the LOA).* Cons: * my renewable scholarship may be affected for 4th year, as it's based on my GPA in the *two semesters* of the previous year. If I'm on leave during the second, obviously I'm not earning any credits. I'm currently waiting for confirmation from the bursary department at my school. * would still have to drop the A+ elective because it's a full-year course, not just 1 semester. It would suck to drop because of the book review I wrote. I cannot see any other way I could rewrite that paper if I were to retake the course next year, unless I ask the professor to write my review on another book (?just a thought--that would make things a lot easier). * If I take the full-year course in 4th year, I take that with 5 core courses + the 3 I couldn't take during my LOA. That's the perfect number of courses for full-time students, but it'll be overwhelming (4 heavy accounting courses per semester). * On top of this, I'd have to take the three electives (9 credits) I was originally supposed to take in 4th year, during the summer after my LOA. That's fine because it's the exact number of credits we're allowed to take in the summer, but I'd be missing 1 (3 credits). Unless I take the option to graduate a year later and balance those courses that way, but I'm unsure how my scholarship would be affected. **Option 3: No LOA** Basically, I'll just take my exams for the 2 courses I'm marginally failing in, end up with a D+ or C or C+ (best case scenario), and if I'm not satisfied with my mark, I'll retake them next year or during summer break for the one course I can. After my last exam, I'll take the full 3 weeks of winter break to work on myself, my health, start therapy, and hopefully build some kind of rhythm that I can carry on with me into the winter semester. *This is me trying to be optimistic*, but I have to convince myself that it's attainable, so I don't crash and fall back into a depressive episode.

"Would you do an unpaid internship for a startup with 1 employee if you got to travel the world on their dime. TLDR at the end. I (25M) own my own company and am debating hiring an unpaid intern at some point in the future from the film department at my old university. I studied film and graduated in 2020 so there were no jobs in the field I was interested in. Fortunately I got a job working for a mortgage company doing sales and made a LOT of money. It was not the job I wanted so I ended up quitting, traveling the world, and making music (which is my passion). I have enough saved to continue traveling for a few years if I really wanted to. I registered my company as a record label for legal and tax purposes as I make my own music and spend money on advertising. I’m still currently traveling but when I get home I’m going to focus on making music full time and try to make a career out of it before money runs out and I need to get a traditional job again. Once I have enough music lined up for proper releases, I thought about the idea of hiring an unpaid intern for 3-4 months to help me create music videos, short form content, and implementing marketing strategies. We would travel all around the world (mainly south east Asia), just them and myself, staying in hostels and maybe a few hotels. I’m thinking I would pay for their accommodation, food, and travel while we’re abroad (I’d have them pay for their flight out of the US and back to the US only). South East Asia would be cheaper than paying them minimum wage but it wouldn’t be much different. So I could maybe pay them minimum wage and have them pay for everything themselves and it would end up being roughly the same amount anyways (I haven’t worked out the specifics). Also, I’d like to hire someone from my old university so they can gain experience and build a portfolio to help them get a job after graduation. I’d prefer that over hiring a freelancer. It would also have to be for college credit (which in theory would be worth a few grand by itself at my old university). I, myself, have done a few unpaid internships where I paid to travel to a different state, paid for my own accommodation, and food (issuing student loans). This is something I personally would be wanting to do opposed to the former if the option was available and that’s why I ask. Obviously the ideal situation for the intern is that they get paid and all expenses are included. But if you were offered this opportunity would you take it? Is this reasonable/realistic? What are your thoughts? TLDR: I’d hire an unpaid intern to help me plan and shoot music videos and short form content along with marketing them for me as an artist under my record label. We’d travel around SE Asia and I’d pay for accommodation, food, and transportation while abroad. It would just be me and the intern.

"International Students in a Group Paper. We've been assigned groups for our semester long group projects, and in a group of 6, 3 of the students in our group are non-native English speakers. In our small bit of communication (basically just introducing ourselves, and splitting the work up), it's pretty clear that they have some trouble with English, especially written. I can't say I don't empathize, if I had to write an essay about something complex in another language, I'd be hard pressed to write anything. However, as it's a group project, I'm also worried about my personal score. I have maintained a 4.0 throughout my college experience (beginning of Junior year now), and ideally I'd like to keep that up, however I'm pretty concerned with the quality of work we are going to be able to produce in this class. The class requires about 20 pages double spaced, for 3 individual presentations on the project (all about a month apart). We are graded on grammar, spelling, and the overall cohesiveness of the work (ie. It shouldn't sound like 6 different people wrote it). How should I go about ensuring the quality of the paper, without either writing it all myself, or having to damn near re-write 3 parts of the essay? Not to mention having to go through about 60 pages of work, throughout the semester. Just feeling a bit overwhelmed by the issue, and feel I'm in a bit of an unfair situation. The class overall should be very easy, and 20 pages between 6 people really wouldn't be a difficult prospect at all, but with the addition of 3 people who seem to struggle with English, I feel as though my group has a heavier workload, as we will either have to write more ourselves, or spend extensive time editing and rewriting large portions of the paper",Fees,Medium,1.0,web:reddit:r/college:search:unfair grading,Medium,1,1761,310,7,International Students in a Group Paper.,0
"The Students Doth Protest Too Much. A few students who received zeros or F's along with academic integrity referrals emailed to inform me that they have *never* cheated and *never* used AI.

The funny part - The students were not accused of cheating or of using AI.

The only person saying anything about ""cheating"" or ""using AI"" is the student. The strong denial of something they weren't accused of - well, that's interesting.

"I got punished for going to office hours. Ok so I had a question on a homework assignment today and I went to my professor's office hours to, you know, ask the question. When I arrive, there's another student there who has a problem with his grade on the LAST homework assignment. While I wait for the professor to get done with the other students, this guy asks me, what did you get for ""problem A"" on the last homework? Trying to help a fellow classmate, I open my last homework assignment, the graded version, and he compares them. For the question he was concerned about, he noticed that I got less points taken off than he did, even though we arrived at the same incorrect answer. Note, our work was not identical and we had different graders. Unfortunately, he had to involve ME in his conversation with the professor and explained how he got a lower score than me, and so the professor asks for my name, opens my graded homework file in front of us and proceeds to take points off of MY work. Mind you, this is before I even had any of my questions answered. So I made the effort to go to office hours, you know, since most professors encourage that, and, as a result, I get my grade lowered while I NEVER asked for my assignment to be opened/regraded. This just feels so unfair and I don't think I will ever go back to office hours with this particular professor again. Not to make this a sob-story, but I have depression/ocd which makes it hell for me to be proactive (getting assignments done early and going to office hours).

"What do you do when you aren’t sure what you actually want to do with your life. Please only give serious answers. Throughout my life, I’ve changed what career I wanted to work in MANY times. I had considered being an anesthesiologist, psychologist or psychiatrist, biologist, photographer, etc. When it came time to go to college, I wanted to go into Genetics, so I went to a school that’s well known for its medical school. Right before orientation, I changed my mind and switched to Criminal Justice. I’m near the end of my first year and I’m a freshman/sophomore. I don’t know what I’m doing. CJ is largely known for jobs in law enforcement, like a police officer. Other things are like corrections, criminology, etc. I was told the four main pathways in this field are 1. CJ. 2. Switch to bio or chem and work towards a masters in forensics. 3. Switch to political science and go for law. 4. Switch to psychology and work towards a master’s and PhD. I’ve always planned to at least get a master’s to help enhance my chances in getting a job. I don’t want to be a lawyer, I don’t want to do a lot of chemistry (that’s why I switched from genetics), I don’t really want to work in psychiatry, and I don’t want to be in law enforcement. I was originally thinking criminology and do research, but I don’t want to do studies and write long academic papers the rest of my life. I don’t know what I want to do. My dad thinks I should be an engineer because I’m good at math, but I don’t really want to do that the rest of my life. My mom thinks I should be an actuary, which I do like statistics, but again, I don’t really want to do a lot of math. I’m a very big introvert, and would never make it in business, like sales or marketing. Already turned away from the law and medical fields. I don’t want to be a doctor or really anything in healthcare. Plus I hate public speaking and the idea of having to fight for someone you know is guilty. I don’t want to be a teacher. I don’t know anything about computer science. The thing is, I really do enjoy my CJ classes, but I don’t see myself doing any of those careers. I also thought about the FBI, but they had someone from the FBI come and speak to us and he said your chances are better getting into an Ivy League than the FBI. The problem isn’t my grades either. I did two grades in one year, all honors, AP, and dual enrollment throughout high school, which is why I’m a sophomore (credit wise) my first year here. Does anybody have any tips. I feel like I’m having a midlife crisis and I only legally became an adult this year. I don’t know what to do. It seems like I don’t like anything. I want to do something where I won’t have to be worrying about money, but I really do want to do something that I’ll enjoy since I’ll be doing it for the rest of my life. People say you don’t have to have it all figured out yet, but I’m done with my generals and fully in only classes for my major. I know I could still switch majors, but it hurts to switch after putting the work and money into classes that will essentially be pointless if the other major is completely different. I just don’t know how you know what you’d like to work in, until you’ve tried it. And yeah, there’s internships and part time jobs, but any of the things I’ve been interested in have never really had part time jobs as an option or wouldn’t take you as an intern unless that’s your major.

"Desperately need advice on my current academic situation. Hi everyone. First of all, I would like to apologize in advance for any grammatical mistake I will make in this post, english is not my first language. Last year I started a Master's program in Computer Science at a top 10 university in a foreign country, and my goal was to pursue a phd position after getting my master's degree. Specifically, I'm majoring in Theoretical Computer Science and minoring in Machine Learning. During my undergrad I was a top student, I studied a lot and always mantained a crazy high gpa. The education I received in my undergrad uni wasn't very good though. This is mostly a systemic issue, in the sense that in my home country you can't find a very good uni for Computer Science (with respect to USA/UK standards) and back then I wasn't really aware of the education quality gap between foreign unis and my country's unis, I didn't even imagined I could have applied somewhere outside of my country. Not only I didn't get a super solid theoretical foundation on most areas of CS, but I also didn't manage to get the practical experience undegrad students who are interested in academia go for, such as TAing, working in a lab, trying to get a paper published somewhere, coding projects involving paper replication, you get it. Thanks to my good grades I was able to get into the above mentioned ""ivy league"" master program. This is when I became fully aware of the gap between me and my colleagues: most people here have already published papers, are currently working in labs, they attend conferences, know many people in the field, and have a lot of practical projects under their belts. This motivated me to do my very best, but my first semester wasn't stellar: I did only 3 of the 4 exams I planned to do, and ended up with a mediocre gpa, despite me putting a lot of effort: this uni is way more demanding and rigorous than what I was used to in my undergrad, and the semester assignments took all my time away. I was kinda depressed, but I was still determined to improve my situation: I planned to focus my energy on improving my mediocre gpa in the following semester. Things were pretty ok during said second semester: even though I spent most of my days attending lectures and completing my assignments, I was getting way better results, even in very tough and math heavy theoretical courses. Things went south again during the summer break, when I was supposed to prepare for the incoming exams. During that time I had to find a new accomodation since my current rental contract expires before the beginning of the next semester, and the city I live in is famous for having a crazy housing market: I sent houndreds of applications and I was constantly rejected for 3 months straight. This took away a lot of my time since this process involves taking part in ""room castings"" in which you have to phisically go to the place being advertised and present yourself to the current tenants in a interview, so that they can get to know you. Needless to say, this negativaly impacted on my exams. In particular, today I bombed a big exam that accounted for 60% of the course grade (got full marks on the assignments that accounted for the remaining 40%). I don't think I'll fail it but the grade is gonna be sufficient at best. Regarding the other exams I took this month, I did good but not good enough to stand out. Now I'm hearthbroken. I really put my hearth and soul into studying and working hard this semester and I'm probably gonna have the same mediocre gpa as last semester. I was really hoping that I would have been able to put myself togheter gpa wise so that I could also focus on other activities that could make be a better phd candidate and catch up with the other people in my program. Is it delusional for me to still think I could get a phd position? I tried to ask this questions to some friends of mine who are either phd students themselves of working very close to people in the research groups I'm most interested in, but I'm afraid they are too nice to tell me that I suck even if it's actually true. They say showing commitment and getting involved with said research groups is an even bigger factor than grades. What do you think I should do or prioritize next semester to still hope to get accepted somewhere? Should I just accept that I'm gonna get mediocre grades and spend more time developing a proper portfolio? If so how can I find the courage to go up to a professor to ask him/her to get involved with his/her research group when I didn't do particularly well on the courses they are lecturing? Why would they pick me when there are a lot of other students who perform better than my and have more practical experience? I feel that If my chances were slim last year, they are basically close to zero now.

"It's not that it's necessarily complicated; but it's labor-intensive. Editors are paid roles at most sizable publishers - emailing back and forth with a bunch of authors and reviewers all day is actual work. Even if it's volunteer work done through a university, someone is paying for their time. You may hate getting solicitations, but if you were starting up a completely new journal, you'd want to get the word out about it somehow. That's communications and marketing work. Plagiarism checks aren't that expensive on their own (it is cheaper through Crossref than direct, but you have to give Turnitin access to all your full text content in exchange for the subsidized fees, and that's a technical data conversion process that has to be slogged through), but someone has to literally run the manuscripts through the software, read the resulting reports, and make decisions based on what comes out. Labor is labor. I agree that none of this is impossible, but paring it down to the most basic, shoestring level still isn't going to make it easy and free.

Franklin and Marshal - 20k Merit Aid COA around 68k + I get IB credit so I go in with 1 year of credits (I do NOT like the area as I am from Cali and it is very gloomy) BUT small classes is a plus 3. Ohio State - Don’t know too much about it but it has a good rank and big classes (I like this option the most I think…) 4. Penn State 5. UC Riverside, or Santa Cruz I heard it’s hard to switch majors, and since I don’t know what to do yet, I don’t think it’s the best fit. 6. Indiana University ANY input is appreciated! THANK YOU! Edit: Tons of people have responded with Penn State! Unfortunately while i did get into the main campus, I applied for the education program, so my first semester will be in harrisburg, in a school? “learn by doing” type program. But, I really don’t want to spend the first semester away from a campus, which is why I haven’t considered penn state. It’s been more of a plan B if that makes sense 😭.

"Should I change programs (from PhD in IR to Masters in Creative Writing). Hello everyone. So I am currently an international student studying in Florida to get my doctorate degree in International Relations. But the things is I realized that I am no longer interested in my degree. This does not mean that I don't like the topic, but I have been studying International Relations non-stop for eight years. And this summer, we have taken out comprehensive exams, and I was the only one who failed both sections of the comprehensives. And apart from that, I don't feel like I work well with my academic advisor while he is also in my comprehensive exam committee. And I just really don't like living in Florida. I don't like its weather and how car dependent it is, even though I don't have that many problems with my school. With that said, I came to the conclusion that I want to study creative writing, as I have always wanted to create stories but never had time to work on my story writing skills properly. And just to be clear, I have both Bachelors and Masters degree in international relations, and I would be applying for Masters Program in creative writing.

"is 40k in student loans reasonable for me. Would love to hear from a social sci major who had to decide between their in-state or a “better” school. Context: Co ‘27, I’m having such a rough time with financial aid rn. My EFC went up by 10k, and no schools have offered me any need-based aid. It’s just me and my dad, and he says he’s budgeted 30k a year for me (totally reasonable and I’m v glad I have his support!). Problem: my top choice is 60k a year (room/board/fees; this includes the scholarship I was given). If my math is right, I’ll need to take out aprox 40k in loans. I may be leaving some factors unaccounted for so let’s make it a range of 30-50k. My Question: is it worth it? The general advice I see is don’t take out more than what you’ll make after graduating. My issue is i’m going for International Relations, so I could be making anything from 40-70k. Obviously I don’t *want* to make 40k, but I’m aware it’s a possibility. This school specializes in my major, I can come back home on the weekends, is in the city I want to work in, and has strong ties to the State Dept. (dream job). Is it perfect?

"How my university life was affected by my family issues. Vent incoming! PSA: I (23) grew up in a family environment of emotional neglect and abuse. My father (63) was never there emotionally or mentally for any of us (my mother and my sibling) and abused my mother (51) verbally, financially and emotionally. I grew up seeing and hearing my father yelling at my mom for nonsensical themes, blackmailing her financially (even though he is well paid from his job) and being constantly angry about everything. I remember myself retiring to my room and / or not talking much when he was arriving home because he was constantly angry. No one knew why he was angry, and if we tried to ask him, he would burst out and yell and call names. He would never show up in school events and he would expect my mother to video record them for him to see them in the evening--actually, he never really cared about them. When we would take our grades, we were scared if they weren't A's, and if they were inferior than A's, he would compare us to other classmates of ours. There were also times that I have been slapped by my father when raising my voice against him. My mother was the one who actually raised us, but she was also most times either emotionally unavailabe or her emotions towards me and my sibling were contradictory. She would at times show us signs of affection, but if we did something she didn't like (from not washing the dishes or forgetting something unimportant to even lying), she would straight up call us names, degrade us, make us feel like trash. She never let us cry, for her it was a sign of weakness. She would invalidate our emotions by telling us she's tired and doesn't want to hear us. **We were raised trying to get our mother's validation, and we were raised trying to do stuff right in order to gain her love and approval**. Keep this last one for later, because it's important for the university lore. Well I went to the University, in the prospects of being a historian. I got to understand something's wrong regarding my daddy issues in the second year of uni when I met a professor who's now a father figure/found father to me, who helped me see the right ideal of paternity, but the shit unfolded in the third year, when I met a certain professor who was teaching one of my favorite subjects. We will call him mr. S (50). Mr S is a shy person, who doesn't take up space, doesn't try learning anyone's names in his classes. He's known in his academic field. I had known him before attending uni, due to some documentaries he appeared in. He def has social anxiety, and always has some awkward aura. Never talks about himself, an absolute yapper about anything related to his academic field. Mildly conservative and religious (just like my mother). He's got the reputation that he's strict. I hated the way he did his lectures, but this never stopped me from asking stuff in class, sending e-mails, asking him random stuff in person after class. In the midst of the semester, he got to know my name. *I was the only person he called by my first name, out of the entire amphitheatre.* I was in shock. And this would happen in every class of his I got to attend. But anyways he set a high standard for me and I got a 6/10, because I didn't meet his expectations in his basic course (even though I studied hard for his exam). I felt fucking worthless in my own favorite academic field. I started attending therapy later in that year. He would *still* wait for me to join his seminar course of the next academic year. But at that time, I was in shambles. It took me 2 months to recover from this, yet I felt really sick even by seeing his name in any book. Yet, whenever he would see me at university, he would always tell me that he's waiting for me to join his seminar course. He even mistook a friend of mine for me and told her the same thing. Bro even made an exception for me, because his seminar course had criteria of presence record (I had to had scored 7 and above in his basic course, and I had a 6/10), under the only condition I would score a 10 in his class. We had an amazing time together. I taught him how to figure out how to work in his old ass laptop. We had academic debates. He liked our talks at the office at times. He continued to give me the princess treatment as well, for example he sent only me to see archival work for my seminar paper he supervised. I was still the only person he remembered by name. I started feeling.different towards him. Before that semester I used to look at him and feel extreme anxiety, fear, I was trying to avoid him, and his name made me feel sick. Now, I couldn't wait for the time I would see him again. Whenever I would see him smile, I would feel happy deep in my soul for seeing him being happy. I felt this was progressing into some next level Wattpad shit. Yet I was still so scared I would again not meet his expectations on me. **I asked myself why this was happening to me, and my therapist told me because I correlated him with my parents.** Everything that happened with S after that, was analyzed under the prism of how I projected my parental issues on him. And it fucking worked. So when he accused the entire class of fraud, including me, I was in shambles still, but *this time* I knew very well why I felt like that. But I took it personal, and I chose not to follow him in my Master's the next year. This was a boundary to protect myself. But I wanted to keep in touch with him, because I knew that to me, he was still just a reflection of my parental trauma. Besides, the accusation was never personal from the start, because he did that to everyone. I talked to him, I set my boundaries, I told him how his presence, in his ways, was critical in addressing my mental health. I felt it was unfair to lash my parents' failure on him. And after all that, I really wanted to remember how beautiful this semester was. I knew, though, that I should take my measurements and stand on my own feet, without having authority figures on my head. We still keep in touch. He wants me to review his new book. He also wants to send me abroad, to do my PhD in the USA, in order to help me become an academic myself, with a topic proposition he *knew* I always liked. My therapist addressed me that even after all these, he still believed in me, after all.

So if i don't have these accomodations, I'm worried I'll do bad and fail again. I can't really explain how it helps so much, but it does. My grades very clearly reflect that, because the before and after is literally- i mean literalllyyy - night and day. If I showed you my 5 wouldn't believe it's the same person.

I have a class that ends at 11:50 AM and a class that starts at 5:30 pm so I try to make the most of my time in between classes by studying in the library but I just can't get into it. With heavy material when I try to read the text book on campus all the information just flies right over my head and I'm left clueless. I've tried other methods of studying like Anki flash cards and it works fine at home but on campus my mind just can't sponge the info. It could also be that I'm just not comfortable focusing in public spaces. But I'm curious if anyone else on here is having similar issues,Library,Medium,1.0,web:reddit:r/college:search:library issue,Medium,1,641,126,13,Having Trouble studying on campus.,0

"Taking some (but not all) students to a conference. bad idea. I have a few undergraduate students in my lab in addition to a tech (who is planning to go to grad school). One of the undergrads has been in my lab for a little under a year, and the other two have been with me for half a year or so. I'd like to have my tech to go to a conference with me to present and I think this can be justified without it seeming unfair as she is full-time and has data to present.

"burnout at the halfway point. hi all how many of you all have suffered from burnout during grad school? i keep being told conflicting things — namely that im not prioritising grad school, that im not doing enough while also being told its not healthy for me to be at the building 8am to 12am and that i need to go home and not focus on grad school all the time (but then when i take breathers and breaks or take time to myself, we go back to the not prioritising school. for example, i had no class, someone scheduled something without clearing it with me first when i had a hair appointment that had been moved twice already for a wedding. so i moved the appointmrnt to when i didnt have anything schedule and got told i wasnt prioritising grad school and chastised for a hour long appointment in the middle of the day, a day before i left for the wedding lol). and im feeling pretty hopeless for my future, my career and pretty much everything. im in a 3 year program so i have a year and a half left and feel so much like im ruining my prospects and future. i had a non-field full time job that while toxic, i miss the work so much. i miss feeling good at my work and while i had issues with work life balance there, working 12 hour shifts without breaks, i didnt feel like my entire purpose and self esteem and sense of self was caught up in this shit. i am pretty mentally ill and struggling to stay on my meds because of the demands of my program. theres a lot im not allowed to say no. the more im here the more i wonder if im even in the right field — but my dream remains the same, just different. i would love some tricks on beating burnout at the halfway point and setting better boundaries in a program for a career where overtime is expected and poorly compensated.

"Harsh grading environment, don't know what to do. Hi peeps. So this year I'm taking an entry-level computer science course. But this semester has been really, really hard. I've gotten week-long illnesses twice, each time letting my professors know by e-mail, and there was a week in the middle of March where my mental health was so bad that I barely got out of my own room (luckily I managed to collect myself and was back to normal after talking with my family). The issue is that 50% of the class grade is based on attendance alone, and with basically half of the days away, an astronomical portion of my grade is just unrecoverable. There's no way to ""make up"" attendance. The other issue is that the other 50% is based on exams that involve sending program files through Brightspace, and despite my efforts to improve, I'm an unacceptably bad test-taker. I get test anxiety, and I feel incredibly intimidated whenever I struggle with a problem. Things make sense in class and in office hours, but when exams happen, I forget everything. So the exams do not get finished, and as a result I've gotten more zeroes than I'd like. These exams happen every two weeks. I had tried to, at the midterm course review, ask for other graded assignments to do, like homework or projects, to try and help. All were turned down because ""You can just use AI which makes these things being graded a moot point."" Which is fair, but technically the same could be said for the exams, and I'd like to stay away from that and do my own work. And, when I e-mailed this professor about my troubles, all I got in response was ""If you learn the topics and come to solve the exam problems, you will pass"". Like I haven't been trying this already. So, what do I even do? Do I just go sit in the corner and cry again? Do I fail and get kicked out of college?

"Last week I was told to find a different lab by my PI. I'm in my fifth year. The title is the summary. I'm a fifth year graduate student working in a STEM field. Last week my advisor told me that the project I had been working on for the past 9 months needed someone with a different skillset and background than what I have. Also, that there were no other projects in the lab I can work on because of my academic background. The surreal thing is.I'm not surprised. I've seen this coming from the start of 2021. For the past 9 months she has been mentally abusive to me. On the weekends, I would receive short story emails about how bad of a student I was. Small mistakes got amplified and held over my head for months. I would get scolded for defending myself if there was something about my data or reports that she didn't like. I am not allowed to explain why I did something a certain way if she didn't like the way it was done. She offered little to know help on my preliminary examination last spring making me lean heavily on my labmates and other doctoral students. My exam came and went and I didn't pass. My advisor cited issues that were not part of my examination and how terrible the exam was. My retake is in October, Last week, early September, she decided to kick me out. Wouldn't even allow me to retake it. I've talked to the head of my department. I was told to not take things personally because she has a bad reputation and I should of known this when I joined her lab. The department head knows everyone in her lab is unhappy and that is common for 3 or 4 graduates students to want to transfer labs at all times. I talked to one of my committee members to explain the situation. They thought I did great on my preliminary examination and all I was being asked to do was re-write my introduction and fixe the format of my proposal. After speaking with my committee member, it is clear that I was being gas lit on how bad the examination went. I'm just terrified. I don't want to master out but I don't want to start all over again. I was real close to the finish line and had it striped away from me. I'm not a bad grad student. I have a 3.9+ GPA, passed my qualifying exam on my first attempt and have a first author and co-author paper currently in review. However, I will admit that my progress on my second project has been slower than I wanted, but it's not like I'm not progressing on it. The problem is, my department head is right. Everyone in my lab has sever issues with her. Lab alumni have issues with her. Other professors have issues with her. She's done to other graduate students what she's done to me. Everyone in my lab is terrified right now. If it can happen to me, then why can't it happen to them. I've had tremendous amounts of support from my labmates and other professors. I just don't understand how she is able to continue to have students with the way she treats her students isn't a secret within the department. I don't really know how to end this.

"transferring to a US University/college as an international student. So I've had this subject in mind for a while. I'm a high school senior who's starting university soon. It's one of my most desired goals to study abroad to get quality education and meet new people from different backgrounds in new different environments. The reason why I picked the US in particular is because of my fluency in English, which I figured would save me a great deal of language learning time and contribute to my field instead, and the fact that I'm more familiar with it than any other country besides my own. Sorry if this blab was unnecessary. I put it just in case. So my plan is to start university here in my country (jordan) and transfer later. When? I don't know. I don't know weather the year of transfer matters to the policies and requirements or not. I would like to transfer on the second year, if possible. Please enlighten me. Can I just apply like a first year would? How different is it from being a first year? Do I need to submit additional docs? Another issue that doesn't matter for the time being but still have to confront it anyway, scholarships.

"I was in undergrad in the early 90s and grad school in the late 90s. The rise of email coincided with other technological innovations that enabled work to follow you from the office, classroom, or wherever you worked. When I was in college, laptops weren't a thing, so to use a computer meant sitting down in a computer lab, at a terminal workstation, or at a personal PC in your dorm room, if you could afford your own computer. (Our dorms didn't get network access—I wouldn't even call it ""internet access""—until my senior year.) If I needed to send a professor a message, my choices were (1) camp outside their office until they showed up; (2) leave a note in their departmental mailbox; or (3) wait until I saw them for class or lab. Course management systems didn't exist, so there were no online gradebooks or online assignments/submissions. Powerpoint, if it existed, was unknown to us; even if a professor had access to it, there were no computer hookups or data projectors in classrooms to show them. Lectures were either on chalkboards, overhead transparencies, or 35-mm slides in carousels. Everything that happened on-campus, whether it was educational, recreational, or administrative was 100% analog, either in-person or on-paper. Of course, none of this was remarkable to us at the time. It was the only thing we knew. What it did require (as students) was a degree of planning in advance, figuring out who to talk to about particular issues, and working together to find solutions.

"[Rant] This whole thing kinda sucks. I'm a pretty average guy, especially compared to a lot of people on this sub, and I really don't enjoy this. Sure, I'm involved and curious and want to know more, but that still doesn't mean I like this. I probably have different complaints than most of you here, but that doesn't mean it doesn't piss me off. You start off thinking ""Wow, this is a chance to really think about where I want to go!"" and you get really excited and start thinking about the cool places you could possibly go. And it doesn't just happen all at once. No, it's not that nice. You start to get really excited about one school and then you take a closer look, and discover a damning fact that makes it virtually unattainable. And then you start looking at another, thinking ""Ok, yeah, that's a close second. I can live with this. This seems really cool."" But then, you do more research into it, and it too flies just out of reach. And this happens multiple times. Hell, right now, I'm not even so sure the school I was first interested in, the one I keep coming back to, is even an actual possibility anymore, with finances being what they are. And I just get more internally bitter and resentful about it, because I don't want to suck it up and go to a god damn cow college flagship in this crappy state, even for a year (mostly because I've heard transferring is a pain and you miss out on a lot not starting out there) even though I have stats and ECs to get in elsewhere.

"help with collaborative writing and managing citations for large manuscript. Hoping to get some answers/ideas here. I've nearly finished edits on my book manuscript that I'm soon returning to the press. Before I do, a language editor is going to be checking text and making edits as needed because there is foreign language text in the manuscript. She may also make some comments. I'm hoping though that as she is starting this that I can continue to edit the final pages of the last chapter and the conclusion. Thing is, there are hundreds of in-text citations and a long bibliography. I have traditionally used EndNote where I use the cite-while-you-write feature in Word. In my ideal world we could simultaneously work on the document in either Google Docs or Microsoft Word online without the citations getting messed up. But the Google add-in for EndNote is super buggy and just not efficient, even though I already annoyingly paid the fee for the most updated version. What's worse is that if we do all of the edits in google doc and then save as docx, then citations convert to plain text and can't be changed in Word at that point. My university IT is blocking the EndNote add-in for Word online and right now I'm waiting to figure out if there is any way to bypass it. So I'm wondering if anyone has ideas of how I can make this work. I have Zotero now and just imported my entire EndNote Library to Zotero. But I've written the book on Word and all of the live citations are there already. Is there a way to easily upload this to Google Docs and use Zotero moving forward?

"Will not taking 4 years of a foreign language affect my chances. Hi, I am a current junior, and this year I chose not to take a foreign language.

I do not speak French at home, and I have never lived in a French-speaking country. I was able to achieve near fluency during middle school. So I decided not to take any foreign language classes in my Junior year. I'd also like to note that I am a TA for AP French this year. Will this hurt my application?

"I am thinking about filing a hostile workplace complaint against the dean. The dean emailed me at 6 am this morning to micromanage an announcement in my online course. The course she already had me design and then redesign over the summer for free. I'm an adjunct, being paid 2K for a 15 week course. I am thinking of filing a hostile workplace complaint. Am I overreacting? TLDR: I am an adjunct who teaches online English. I have a Ph.D. and I have had a full time teaching job at another school for ten years. At my home school, two of my courses are used at the campus wide master course, so I feel I am pretty good at course design. I was hired to teach a class in Summer. I designed and ran the class. I had a folder for each week with dates. I had a late policy in the course and syllabus that allowed students to turn things in up to one week late. In the last week of the class a student asked to turn in all the work of the course. It was the first time she had logged in. I told them no. The student complained to the dean. The dean said that since I didn't have a date on each assignment, the student was right to be confused, although no other student was confused in this manner. The dean then went through the course and cc'd the chair on an email telling me to revise many of the assignments (not calling me Dr. Pizza but M. Pizza). It felt like retaliation to me, but whatever, I did it and emailed it to them even though the class was over. I was assigned to design and teach a literature based course for fall. I designed that class. There was a textbook, but it was mostly literature in the public domain, so I just included PDFs of literature they needed to read and told students not to buy the book. The course was ready 6 weeks early so I could be sure they could look at it. Dean didn't like that there was no book and emailed (not calling me Dr. Pizza but M. Pizza) I needed to redesign it and use the textbook in an email CCd to the chair. I redesigned the course using the textbook, removing all the files so students would have to use the book. Course started a couple of weeks ago. The dean emailed yesterday morning saying students were complaining to her because the bookstore was out of the book. (Why are students emailing the dean instead of me? Why is she responding instead of asking them to email me?) She told me to scan the book and post chapters. I don't have a scanner, so I posted an announcement in class telling students that the readings are in the public domain and could be found for free using google. The dean emailed me at noon yesterday and said, no, you need to post links yourself. I was busy teaching face to face classes, so I didn't get around to doing it. The dean emails me at 6 am today saying she is still getting student complaints that they couldn't do the reading. I responded and said that it had been less than 24 hours, and I would certainly get to it, but maybe she should listen to the students who want the texts available on the first day, the way I had originally designed the course. She emailed and accused me of phoning it in, despite my having now redesigned this course twice. I have never had a dean email me at 6 am to micromanage the text of an announcement in an online course. I have never had to design and then redesign a course because a dean was crawling through it. I have never had students emailing the dean with questions, and have the dean entertain those questions. So am I over reacting to think that this level of hostile micromanagement needs to be reported? Through it all, the chair has been meek and quiet, making me think they are scared of the dean. They chair may not be able to complain, but I have little to lose by filing the complaint. Who cares if I lose a job paying 2K?

"How do you start your career as a programmer in artificial intelligence. The main goal of artificial intelligence is to simulate human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and their actions. The goal of Artificial Intelligence developers is to build AI functionality into software applications. To start a career as a programmer in artificial intelligence first prepare to showcase your knowledge of java, python, and R programming. Even C++ is helpful to build and implement models. To understand and implement different AI models need basic knowledge of algebra, probability, and statistics. To implement machine learning models understand machine learning algorithms like linear regression, KNN, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine. To work with large volumes of data need to know about Spark and other big data technologies such as Hadoop, MongoDB, and Cassandra. to build AI models with unstructured data, you should understand deep learning algorithms. The most important skill is to teach the machine to solve problems the way a human would through the use of programming.

"Unhappy with my thermodynamics grading distribution, discussion inside about it, feel free to contribute ideas about how courses should be graded in STEM courses. This post isn’t actually about unfair curving or anything like that. I’m actually unhappy with the grade distribution for my thermodynamics class, which is 42.5% homework and 42.5% small quizzes literally a week after we learn the material, some other small grades, and NO exams, which is bullshit if you ask me. Most people would say this is a good thing (no need to intensively study before exams, ideally less stress). However it’s actually been really stressful for me because not having exams means you have to be extremely careful to get questions right the first time around (no second chances to prove yourself during exams, which imo are better indicators of knowledge and learning). Getting stuff right the first time around in a engineering STEM course is just an unrealistic expectation. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve made so many mistakes in the homework, patched up the holes in my game, then destroyed the midterms because I was given a second chance to LEARN. Learning through mistakes has always been how I learned and I almost always show up on exam day fully prepared, ready to smash it. The point of this post is that I’m disappointed because homework grades being worth too much means that my grades for this class has to suffer (I pretty much always get A- or A for all my other courses where exams are 70%+ or where long term projects play a role). Anyways this post should be less about me and more about my making a case for homework grades never being worth as much as exams for grades at least in Engineering, physics, math courses, contrary to what most people would probably want, since I believe that no one should be graded based off of first time performance, like we haven’t even done any problems ever and the professor expects us to get it right the first time? *nickyoung.jpg* Anyway, there’s also a lot of cheaters when it comes to homework anyway, which means the higher the worth of homework grades, the more cheaters benefit. At this point, I’ve just been getting rekt by homework cheggers all semester and imo it’s pretty fucked up that the grades are curved and my homework performance is pitted against cheaters.

Ever since the semester started i have been extremely anxious about my major and college career (to put it some way) I'm a business undeclared major. I'm taking statistics, macroeconomics, philosophy and social psychology. I had a mid-life crisis during winter break and decided to minor in psychology, and i was thinking to possibly switching majors to psych. I didn't talk to my advisor because shes the 'business program advisor' and i didn't know how to bring it up (stupid i know) But, well I didn't switch. I declared a minor instead. I struggle in my classes because I cant make myself care about the material. I don't do the readings, and i skipped class a LOT. i don't know if it's my major, or my classes, or just this whole feeling of doom that overshadows everything. I don't fucking know whats wrong with me. I know that people tend to declare their majors during their sophomore year, but I'm in the business program, taking prerequisites as of right now, and I didn't have the chance to explore around with my gen eds. Im a first gen as well, and i moved to the US 3 years ago, so I didn't have any proper college prep in high school either. I just went to class and passed. I was told to visit the career center, but I doubt it would help me. They can only help you if you know what you want. How are you supposed to help someone who doesn't know what they want or doesn't know if they want help either? Last semester I got excellent grades, and was offered a spot in the honors program, but as of right now, my class attendance is abysmally low, which has only made me lose points unnecesarily. I only have one small 1k scholarship as well, and my tuition is 7k which as i said my dad was willing to pay out of pocket.

I don't dorm or participate in any clubs either. I maximize my misery. Its pathetic. I am pathetic. for the past 2 months, i have thrown countless tantrums at home. I don't want to wake up and face the mess I have made at school. I have a B in my classes right now, and I don't know if i could bring it up. Ive **bombed** my midterms as well. My family finances are looking rough as well. My father lost his job, and I don't qualify for FAFSA because I'm not a US citizen. I wish I'd taken time off after high school to figure myself out and then decide if school was for me or not. Although knowing myself, I wouldn't have done that either! As of right now, the sole thought of school makes me roll my eyes with apathy. Registration for fall classes opens in a couple of weeks for me, and I don't know what to do. i feel as if i have fucked up beyond repair. It gives me anxiety to pick classes because i don't know what I'm doing and I'm deeply scared of fucking things up like I've done the whole spring. My deadline to drop with a W is April 21. In order for me to register, I have to pay my pending balance, but I don't want that money to go to waste because our family finances are tight, as I mentioned.

"Forget building a ""balanced"" list — a safety school manifesto. As seniors are building college lists, it’s a good time to discuss what makes a smart and balanced one. What is a safety school? What is a target school? (Hint: check out [my recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/14md3he/rethink_your_target_schools_if_youre_a_top_student/) on target schools). Today, we’re going to talk safety schools. Here are pretty much all my thoughts on what safeties are and aren’t, how to find them, and how many to apply to. As always, I’ll keep it 100. Let me know in the comments if you have questions, comments, or complaints. Buckle up. This is a longer post, but it’s chock full of advice and helpful links, even at the very end. But first, a quick reality check. Good news and bad news. Let’s do the bad first. **The Bad:** This subreddit is generally obsessed with schools that are nearly impossible to get into. Duh. If you’ve been here for any amount of time you know that. One of the top voted posts the day I drafted this was “What are the top 20 schools based solely on prestige?” I love y’all, but I have to laugh at these. C’mon. When I worked in admissions at Vanderbilt and worked with students in New Jersey and Connecticut, I’d hear seasoned college counselors say how Boston University used to be a solid target or safety-ish school for their average+ A/B students. Now their valedictorians are getting denied and waitlisted. The schools that top the US News &amp; World Report rankings–and I mean not just top 10 but top 20, 50, 100–are really freaking competitive and it’s getting worse. Deep breaths. **The Good:** There are around 4,000 colleges and universities in the United States and the vast majority of them admit 50% or more of the applicants who apply. If you want to go to college, you can, and there’s a really good chance you can do so at a place that is a great academic, social, and financial fit for you. You just have to be smart about it. So, what you need to do is… ~~Have a balanced college list.~~ I’m moving away from the term “balanced” because you don’t need equal numbers of safety, targets, and reaches. But here’s the reality: The foundation of a balanced college list are schools that you like *and you’re* *really really really likely to be admitted to*. These are called “safety” schools. Many people prefer the term “likely” schools, since nothing is guaranteed (unless you have a guaranteed admission agreement–even better!) Here’s whatcha need to know and do. **What defines a safety school for me?** There’s no 100% agreed upon definition for a safety school. Again, a safety school is one you’re all-but-guaranteed to get in. Here’s where I’d start: * GPA range: Colleges tend to report the middle 50% GPA range of admitted students. Take a look at [Common Data Sets for popular schools](https://admitreport.com/common-data-set) — you can get information about their medians as well as other good info about how individual admissions offices run their processes. For a safety school, your GPA needs to be *above or significantly above* the 75th percentile. If their middle 50% is 3.1 - 3.7 and you have a 3.9, that’s a good start. * Testing range: Same as GPA. If you are submitting test scores, your scores need to be above the middle 50% range to consider a school a safety. Not sure if you should submit scores? Test-optional admissions policies are in flux and its important to think that decision through. * Admit rate: It isn’t a safety school if the admit rate is less than or near 50%. I’m looking at you, UC Davis. Truly safe schools should have a 70%+ admit rate. I’d recommend an in-state public. I guarantee you there are schools you’re overlooking, unless you’re in Wyoming which only has one 4-year college… luckily their admit rate is like 96%. * BTW, I think this one is the hardest to hear for super-qualified students. Sure, you could have safe-ish schools with a 60% admit rate or something, but I do not recommend completing your list without any safeties that meet these qualifications. If you’re in California, do NOT assume any UC is a safety. * Extracurriculars &amp; essays: This one is, naturally, more qualitative. I won’t really cover it here, but check out our many posts like how colleges [score your ECs](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/vxeqri/how_top_schools_actually_score_your/), what [“counts” in admissions](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/v6bdz7/the_type_of_ecs_i_wish_i_saw_more_of_as_a/), and how to [write about](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/x1wlao/how_to_quickly_communicate_your_ec_achievements/) your activities to learn more about how to write strong essays, make a case for the school, and discuss your ECs. This is really important and the work I do all day. Make sense? You need all of these. A good bet is to talk to your school counselor and ask about your list and for safety recommendations. **How many safety schools do I need?** A “balanced college list” doesn’t have to be literally balanced across safety, target, and reach schools. Most of my clients have significantly more reach schools than safeties or targets, and I’m 100% fine with that, as long as they have some surefire safeties. You should apply to three safety schools. Why? You’re really safe if you’ve applied to three schools that meet the above criteria. Again, most students should apply to at least one or more safeties that are in-state public schools. Bonus tip: apply to some safeties non-binding Early Action. This is a great way to 1) get early feedback on your app (if you’re denied: reassess!) and 2) get an early confidence boost when you get in. You can breathe a little easier when you’ve gotten in somewhere. **Aren’t safety schools less-than? Don’t the most selective schools have the best teaching quality?** No. As a matter of fact, there’s no reason to think a top-tier research university is going to have great undergrad teaching quality. That is *literally not the point* of a research university. They are, first and foremost, a collection of research activities and training grounds for graduate students. Some, not all, professors at these schools absolutely dread teaching undergrads. Look, I’m not trying to make you feel better. If you think an Ivy League or top-20 ranked school is the “only” place to get a “good” or worthwhile education, you’re incorrect. That’s straight facts, and it’s also more good news since any given student is pretty unlikely to be admitted to a school with a sub-10% admit rate. You can get a great–-in many cases even better for you--education at a number of other schools that would actually be thrilled to admit you. And maybe even give you scholarship dollars to attend. Check out my colleague u/McNeilAdmissions post on [7 true safeties](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/p15eq4/7_true_safeties_with_higher_teaching_quality_than/) with higher teaching quality than Columbia, Chicago, Cornell, and UNC for some ideas. Or use the NYT [Build Your Own College Ranking Tool](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/03/27/opinion/build-your-own-college-rankings.html) (sorry for the paywall). Point is: You. Can. Get. A. Great. Education. At. Tons. Of. Schools. Hell, here you are taking advice from a reasonably successful adult who went to undergrad at a place you’d probably consider a safety. It was more of a target school for me because I wasn’t the \*most\* studious high school student ever. But, hey, I was able to find actually engaging classes, super dedicated professors, and even went to grad school at Vanderbilt so I can impress my parents' friends over the holidays. (Also I’m clearly joking, but just to be clear–Vanderbilt’s master’s program was the \*best fit\* for my professional goals and led me to do this work with you today….If you want my advice, go to a liberal arts college for undergrad because they actually focus on *teaching undergrads*. Then, see what your degree can do for you by working for 1-4 years. Then, attend a research university for grad school because their focus is training graduate students… OR don’t go to grad school at all. If you do, try not to pay for it.) I digress. Maybe we should stop calling them “safety” schools at all since they’re just regular schools. The first college I worked for, University of Mary Washington, would be a safety school for many of you. Do you think the faculty and students are walking around thinking that they’re at a “safety” school? No. I love that school. Another takeaway: find safety schools you like. **Does it matter what major I’m applying for?** Yes! In u/McNeilAdmissions’ post about safety schools, he mentions Purdue University. Purdue *could* be a target or safety-ish (in state maybe) for a humanities major, but it would be a reach for engineering for almost anyone. In general, STEM majors–especially engineering–are more competitive. If you are applying to engineering programs, you should definitely look at some safer in-state options at less competitive engineering schools. **What else should I think about when picking safe schools?** Again, the main thing is to remember that the fact that a school admits more students than it denies has nothing to do with the quality of the education. There are a couple other things students often overlook: * &amp;#x200B; Honors programs: one of my absolute favorite features of many moderately selective schools are honors programs. You’ll likely have benefits like smaller classes, research opportunities, funding, study abroad opportunities, and other cool perks. Check your local state schools. Honors programs rule. [Here’s one](https://honors.cofc.edu/) at one of my favorite schools. [Here’s another](https://academicaffairs.du.edu/honors). * Local internship opportunities: here’s another great piece on Admit Report about using [regional job markets](https://admitreport.com/blog/regional-job-markets) to build a school list. Schools with higher admit rates in key metro areas often have incredibly strong alumni networks and internship/career opportunities. * Campus climate and mental health: I can’t tell you how many times I saw students walking around Vanderbilt’s campus openly crying. I worked in a mental health office there in grad school. Kids at super competitive schools are, well, super competitive and there’s a serious mental health crisis at pretty much every “top” college. You might be wise to leave the rat race before you even enter it and go somewhere where you can balance academics with the rest of life a little easier. And there you have it. My manifesto on safety schools. Know what they are, apply to three, fall in love with them, and think hard about what a fun, enjoyable, educational college experience will really look like for you.

"Taking a semester off due to finances. Need advice on how to use the time well. Hey everyone, I’m a freshman in college (CS major) who may not be able to return next semester due to financial issues. I’m still hoping something works out, but I’m trying to be realistic and prepare in case I need to take some time away from school. In a way it’s kind of my fault because I went to college right out of high school and decided to go to a 4 year knowing that my family isn’t doing great financially. I’ve had help from some family members and FASFA but it wasn’t enough. This isn’t something I want, and I’m not giving up on college long-term. I’ve really enjoyed my time here, especially being involved in student organizations, and I want to put myself in the best position to come back and not have this issue again. If I do end up stepping away for a semester (or longer), I’m trying to figure out what the smartest way to use that time would be. Right now I’m thinking about focusing on things like working, getting reliable transportation, and building skills. For anyone who’s been in a similar situation whether you took time off, transferred, worked before coming back, or changed plans entirely what helped you the most during that period? What do you wish you had done differently? Are there things you’d recommend prioritizing or avoiding? I’d really appreciate any responses Thanks",Transport,Medium,1.0,web:reddit:r/college:new,Medium,1,1392,249,21,Taking a semester off due to finances.,0
"Am I crazy. Hi, I’m a college freshman and I’ve been living with my roommate for a month now. We aren’t really friends and we mostly just not don’t talk and keep to ourselves, until recently. For background info she’s a pretty decent roommate. She told me I can use her mini fridge and she keeps her side tidy. Her only problem is that she’s so fucking loud. And I mean loud. She constantly blasts whatever TV show she’s watching for the week and argues with her girlfriend on speaker. I’ve woken up at 1 A.M on numerous occasions because of them arguing. As for me, I’ve tried my best to be considerate. I understand that she’s a fall freshman so she’s had the room months before I arrived so I try to make my presence as little known as possible. I go to class, go to the library for most of the day, and then only use my dorm to study/sleep. I don’t take calls in my room because I don’t want to bother my roommate. But after the numerous times of her being loud on the phone and me starting to get comfortable with my dorm, I had assumed it was okay for me to take a call from a friend. I was talking to my friend for about 15 minutes until my roommate raised her voice at me and told me I was being “mad loud” (keep in mind that I have headphones on and I was talking low because I understood she was sleeping). Now I’m really angry that I’ve been letting all her shit slide and she can’t even let me be on a 15 minute phone call without her getting mad at me.

"No PI in 2 quarters. Hi r/GradSchool first time poster here. I am only 5 months into my PhD in the US but I am already thinking about quitting. Main reason being that I still do not have a PI (I am ""rotating"", explained more below) and I am almost finished with my 2nd quarter. I just wanted to see if what I am experiencing is normal or if there is anyone that went through something similar. I got my acceptance 2 years ago, however the university strongly suggested I defer until the 2021-22 academic year due to remote learning. They guaranteed that they would match their initial funding offer and keep my spot for next year so I accepted it as I wanted an in-person experience. Long story short, they said the same thing to many students in my program so our cohort this year is more crowded than usual. The first quarter I was doing relatively well. I had two professors that I really wanted to work with and I regularly attended their lab meetings, met up with their students, the whole shindig. We got along well enough or so I thought. One even mailed me right before selections. Towards the end of the first quarter each student had to submit their top three choices to the department and each professor submitted their top 10 for matching. I put them as my number 1 &amp; 2. To my dismay, when everyone in my cohort got an email about their PI, I got nothing. After waiting for 2 days I mailed the department asking if there was an issue. They stalled and said they had matched me, but they were not sure about the respective professor's funding. I found it quite unusual as both professors I wanted said they had funding. After 3 more days of silence I got an email from the department saying that ultimately they could not match me but that it was not my fault and it was due to a lack of funds. They immediately sent me a part time TA'ing form and matched the amount stated in my financial aid form. They also said they would give me another quarter to rotate and find a new PI so long as I took the minimum amount of required credits. I accepted immediately as I did not know what to say and I am an international so I was on edge about my visa requirements. The part that really sucked was I barely had any time. I had more classes than the first quarter plus my first TA'ing experience. On top of that they expected me to meet with a bunch of new professors from different departments on the regular. In first quarter I had already met up multiple times with 8 professors, most of which I did not want to work with. I started being more ""flexible"" in my research areas as they had suggested and to be honest I found a great potential lab that I might join. The professor reached out to me in the beginning of the quarter and told me about his project. I should say that it is not in an area I had thought about at all previously but it is a very grand project and the concepts utilized are pretty cool. I'm on board with it. Right now my worry is that the same thing will happen. This friday I am going to bluntly ask if he will accept me as we have been in contact for weeks and the quarter is 3 weeks away from completion.

However, in order to increase the pace of writing I feed AI with all these foundational concepts I mentioned then ask it to generate a draft sections only based on what I fed it. I re-write these draft sections with my own words without copy-pasting anything and correct it at places where I believe AI did not reflect my thoughts.

"Current grad student's: Share your stipend/budget or tips to save money/ tips in general for new students. Anything you think a new student needs to know. (If you disagree with any of these, just leave a comment and don't downvote. I hate when people do that. I'd much rather be told ""hey this isn't a good tip"", then a downvote that doesn't address the issue. One thing I hate about reddit.) There's a lot of people getting accepted and thought it would help them realize what grad school is like financially. Also, I'm just curious. (Keep in mind, it might change by your major) University of Toledo Stipend: $23k/year Retirement plan: Yes Rent: 1Bedroom Apartment $700/month Electric: (Electric heating) $60-$140/month. Also, electricity can be a scam here in toledo. I had a person knock on my door saying they worked for the electric company (they said the name of the company and dressed like they did) and they needed to correct something on my bill. Long story short, I was stupid/busy, they transfered my account to their company, and after they left I realized my rates would have tripled and luckily I was able to fix it before the damage was done. A week later another guy came and I almost wanted to call the cops on him. Another thing, I got a letter saying that back in November 2000 some committee voted on something and my supplier was going to switch to a different company. My current rate is like 0.02 cents/kilowatt or something and that letter said it was going to go to $0.06/kilowatt. Pretty much my bill would have doubled because a committee voted for something when I was 2 years old. Just, check your email and if something feels off, it probably is. Internet: (AT&amp;T 25mbps) $4/month because of ACP benefit (Thanks Biden) General Fees/University Fees: about $700/semester; don't know what summer is yet; parking permit for year $250; my parent's job provide me healthcare but [here's the link](https://www.utoledo.edu/depts/hr/benefits/student/) Textbooks:. learn how to use the internet lol. Books are expensive. If you have to buy, rent or buy used. I found out a lot of people buy books from small bookstore websites, then sell them for a higher price on amazon. So, try and find small bookstore websites. Renter's Insurance: Around $160/year (liberty mutual) Credit Card: Discover. I need to get a visa because not everybody accepts Discover (ex: Costco). But there is no annual fee, I've made money off it because of cashback, and they have a ""good grades"" thing that got me $20 a year. I did that during my undergrad and I don't know if it applies for grad students, but I don't think they even check. I think I just needed a student email. Furniture for new apartment: Cheapest route is probably thrifting stores, Facebook marketplace, or maybe even putting a flyer up at local churches. However, I lived with my parents before grad school so I just saved all my money and bought furniture off amazon. It's not ""expensive"", but it does add up quick. Definitly a few $1,000 went into that. Bought my TV from best buy open box. Oh, and this one is really ghetto, but sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do. If you drive around dumpsters in apartment complexes or just low-income places you can find stuff. My apartment complex is constantly through out furniture. At first I was tempted to take it, fix it up, and sell it, but I didn't have time and I hate Facebook market place. Tip: Spend a good week looking for programs/local groups that support low-income families. Government programs. Some people shame people who go on welfare and stuff like that, but guess what, you are low-income and definitely qualify. I pay taxes like everyone else and you probably do it. So yeah, abuse it. Get money back. Food: Honesty, I am still debating if it's better to eat out everyday (places like chipotle; not McDonalds or else you'll feel sick. Speaking from experience). When I consider the time it takes to do dishes and cook food, the price I paid for groceries, time to grocery shop and make a list, I almost think going out and getting dinner every other day saves me money and time. But that's an individual thing everyone needs to think about for themself. Lighting: My apartment as two windows and no interior lighting except the kitchen and bathroom. The light switch only controls one outlet per room. So I had to get Wi-Fi led lights. I highly recommend [these](https://www.walmart.com/ip/WiZ-LED-Smart-Wi-Fi-Connected-60-Watt-A19-Color-Tunable-White-Light-Bulb-Dimmable-4-Pack/687078291) (although it looks like the price went up. They were $20). The connection is good. Works simi-well with alexia. The biggest thing I like is it has a ""wake-up"" setting that makes me peacefully wake up everyday. I used to tell myself I am not a morning person, but these lights changed that. Also, since there are no windows I lose track of time a lot. These lights have a daylight cycle that change throughout the day. WATCH OUT FOR BURNOUT! Get a hobby, go for a walk around a metro park, or something. Too many people burn themselves out and I was one of them. Doing classes online during Covid years ago still did a number on me. Pace yourself. Therapy: If you are even questioning if you need it before grad school you will most likely need it during it. I don't know how expensive it is here. I don't recommend studying at home. My issue is I really want to go home after class and tell myself I'll study at home, but I never do. Keep school stuff at school. Keep lab stuff in the lab. Your apartment should be a safe place. My only exception is writing stuff because I have a big monitor and hate my laptop. I know some people in academia are jerks, but I say be honest with your PIs and instructors. Tell them your issues, questions, etc. I mean, don't come up to them with 1,000 of questions and get made they can't help you right there and then. Set an appointment and tell them what your questions are. If it can be done over email, do it. I only had one professor ne a jerk when I had a question, but that was about how an assignment was graded and she gets a pass because she has a relevant health issue. Lastly, if you were a straight A student through out college, you are probably in for a rough time. Not saying it's impossible, but some people in my program are not coping well with the idea they got a B on an exam.

"2nd year uni and feeling overwhelmed. Hello, This might be a bit of a rant so stick with me. I've just been feeling overwhelmed lately when thinking about going back into the second year of university. I found first year really difficult, both in terms of friendships, managing finances and studying. I worked 10-12 hours a week (my uni recommends only 10 hours per week so this was not my wisest choice), I certainly did not have enough time for studying, I felt a lot of pressure to be social all the time and I was just generally really stressed throughout most of it. Ultimately, though my biology results ended up being pretty good, my chemistry results were a disaster- I almost failed these exams! Obviously this inspired some change, and I have decided that this upcoming year I will not work during term time, and I will try to limit extra-curricular activities to a minimum. The thing is, I'm still really worried that I won't do well this year, particularly because chemistry doesn't offer re-sits. Another part of me knows it will likely be fine, and that the reason for my bad grades was working too much, stressing, the collegiate life and those dammed mealtimes (this is another story.) as well as obviously a lack of motivation on my part. Another thing that feels really overwhelming at the moment is studentships. I'm on a two year studentship (half of which I did this year and I loved), and half of which I'm doing next year. Next year, I can either go on a not very ethical volunteer-tourism thing, or I can make my own project. Obviously the second option is more appealing, however despite the fact I know exactly what I want to do this will require a lot of time and planning, and I might not even get it in the end. So is it worth it? Speaking of going abroad, another thing I want to do is study abroad next year. However, the application process for this is intensive, and finances might be a big issue. Also, housing in my uni city is competitive, so on the off chance that I get rejected from a study abroad placement, I may not have a house to return to at uni. So again, the question is, is it worth even applying? Another thing that stresses me out a lot is finances. Granted, I chose the uni I am in, I could have gone somewhere cheaper, so it's on me. However, I have barely enough money to live on, despite having worked since the age of 16 and despite the fact my parents are helping me. I have £2 per week to spend on leisure and social activities- this wouldn't be such a big deal as the societies I enjoy going to are free, but my friends from college frequently go for drinks, meals and other pretty expensive social activities. I feel that if I am honest about my financial situation they will either dismiss it or pity me. Then there are other considerations: what social activities will I have time for next year? How will I manage my finances to last me another 3 years? What about my master's- how can I guarantee I will get a project I like? Ah! It's all so exciting, but also overwhelming and terrifying.

"I'm spiraling and could really use some advice. I'm a first-year Humanities PhD at an R1. This semester has been really tough on me, exacerbated by family problems, etc. I had a 12-page final paper due for a class at midnight yesterday, and when it was around 9pm and I still only had 3 pages, I emailed my prof and said that I was having trouble with it, and that I would take the late penalty and turn the paper in the next day (tonight). He's a great dude, and said that that wouldn't be a problem, and even told me that there wouldn't be any penalty if I turned it in tonight. I now have a whopping 4 pages. I'm sleep-deprived, clinically depressed, and very scatter-brained right now, and there is no way that I can get this super dense paper that's worth 30% of my grade done anytime soon, even to at least get it in at 5am or something. I'm extremely frustrated with myself for thinking that I could have put it off this late. I didn't prioritize it properly with my other papers. 12 pages isn't even very much, but it's a damn hard paper. So what do I do now? Do I email my prof again and say it'll be even later? I don't want him to think that I'm taking advantage of his kindness with the late penalty. He might get annoyed. Do I not email, and hope he doesn't email me first, and turn it in tomorrow night or the next day?

"Skill issue? or overloading myself. I'm at my sophomore year at a community college, hoping to transfer out after next semester. This semester I'm finally taking classes for my major. I'm a generic CS major #67849, so I'm taking Calculus 1 and what my school calls CPS 245, or essentially the first class for CS majors. Calculus is an hour long every M/W/F from 1:00 - 2:00 p.m, and CPS 245 is every T/R, 1:30 - 3:50 p.m. I also am taking a geography class, GEO 125 which has a lecture portion and is immediately followed by a lab portion as a prereq for my gen ed degree that I'm hoping to get after next semester. I also work part-time, usually from \~4:30 - 8:30 M-F. Lately I've been taking off for the weekends. This semester is a lot more work than my previous two, usually around 2-3 hours of homework each night as a minimum for me. Geography is a class that I really don't care about all too much, and it's equally as demanding in terms of workload. Seriously, my exam reviews (thank god my professor gives them to us) is usually about 4 pages worth of questions that I should know and we have both Lecture exams &amp; lab exams at least twice a month each. I also am diagnosed ADHD and take Concerta to help. Lately, I'm not too sure if it's working as I find it difficult to really sit down and study for more than 10 minutes at a time without being distracted and then eventually coming back to studying. I am more than likely going to my doctor to see if I need to change something up. I also really don't do much studying on Monday/Wednesday/Friday mornings, even though they're open to me since I only have Calculus those days. Truthfully, it's really just because it's difficult for me to get out of bed more than an hour before I know I have class. Even waking up at 9:00 a.m would most likely help me and give additional time to study, I just can't really do it. I'll also probably go to my doctor for that. Not sure if that's normal. I just don't understand how I can have time for studying, family, my own interests, exercising, and social connections with my schedule. I mean, I'm essentially gone from 8:00 a.m to 8:00 p.m T/R and 12:00 - 8:00 p.m every M/W/F. The in-between times for classes on the weekdays are usually spent in the school library doing homework. I've seriously started doing homework as soon as I get home, and not finished until past midnight so now some of those assignments are ""late"" because of the 11:59 deadline. I also don't do a lot of homework on the weekends, maybe a small amount Sunday evening. I just want to know if I can help my situation through lightening my workload, or if I really just need to suck it up, get my ADHD in-check and just deal with it. It's just so much harder than my last two semesters, and compared to my peers it seems like I am doing more work, but that could be just because my classes are harder due to my major, or maybe they have more available time than me.

"Contemplating university or college programs in India involves assessing various factors to ensure the right academic and career fit. Start by identifying your interests, strengths, and career aspirations to choose a program aligned with your goals. For instance, engineering, medicine, humanities, management, and arts offer diverse opportunities, each catering to specific skills and professional pathways. Research universities and colleges based on their reputation, accreditation, curriculum, and placement opportunities. Institutions like IITs, NITs, AIIMS, IIMs, and universities like LPU are known for specialized programs and global exposure. Equally important is evaluating the teaching methodology, industry interface, and extracurricular activities offered by the institution. Programs that focus on practical learning, such as internships, industrial training, and research projects, can enhance employability. Additionally, consider the availability of financial aid, scholarships, and campus facilities like hostels, libraries, and labs.

"In a spot of trouble, 3 weeks from being kicked out. Hi all, so I wanted to hear some of your advice on an issue I'm facing with my Master's program. It's a long story, here is the TL;DR with spoilers: About 2-3 weeks ago, I realized that I have been having major issues with my advisor &amp; my Masters research because I associate the experience with past trauma from my abusive dad. I've considered competing theories and none of them weathered my suspicions or could be proven. I've never experienced something this harsh before in my life, although I have struggled with mental health difficulties since high school. Well, as a result of feeling disassociative from my program and from people in it, I got very little done for my degree. This feeling keeps me from working or talking with people. I know some of you will say 'just grit your teeth and do it' but when I'm telling you that I have been doing that for years and I just can't anymore, I'm being pretty serious. I've coped up until this point and just can't anymore. I will say, I am in therapy and it's really helpful but with 3 weeks to go, I don't know how great it'll be. My advisor sat me down 2 weeks ago and told me that I have until August 15 to demonstrate that I can finish on time (by May 2022), or else I'm out of a job. It wasn't surprising to hear it, but it was upsetting. I really do love my career choice. All I want is to be able to do my job. So, I'm taking any advice on what I should do to finish, or what I should be thinking about if I can't manage to get it together and get kicked out. I do have an umbudsperson. The department has been overall supportive so far, but there's only so much they can do. I am funded by a private grant from my advisor. They don't have funding to keep me here past May 2022. My research is in plant science, so I am limited to my summer field season for collecting data for my chapters. I am halfway through one project but the data collected for it is not sufficient on its own. I need another chapter, I need more data, my time is quickly running out. What I really need it guidance but I'm not getting that because I can't talk to anybody. Full schpiel: I started last August under the impression that this would be hard, but I would be fine. Essentially what ended up happening is I moved halfway across the country into an apartment by myself during covid to start my Masters. I was escaping the really difficult mental health effects I was dealing with while living with my parents for longer than I expected (also due to covid). I was so stressed out that I was underweight and losing hair and stuff. As soon as I started, I hit a major wall with my advisor. I wasn't expecting to suddenly feel this. animal fear whenever I would try to interact with him. I mean, I thought it was imposter syndrome at first, but it was so bad that it immobilized me. So, I did what I was supposed to do -- I coped as best as I could, got into university counseling services, and just did as much work as I could do to stay afloat. It was bad though, and I ended up treading water all semester. I would show up for meetings with my advisor whenever they were scheduled, but I felt sick to my stomach every time. I ended up disassociating from my research as a coping strategy and it was not great. I knew I would have to figure out what was happening very soon, or else I risked serious consequences. But I couldn't, for the life of me, talk to anybody about research or the problems I was having. It felt like imposters syndrome on steroids. I felt distanced from everything. Then in the spring semester, I decided that I would tell my advisor that I was bipolar. I made a post about this earlier in the year, and while it made me feel better to say SOMETHING to him, I wasn't actually diagnosed at the time. I was reacting to what my boyfriend (now ex) was telling me to tell him because he felt that my symptoms were spot on and because my advisor reached out about us not being on the same page on stuff. After that, I got a paid evaluation from my university and my therapist concluded that I definitely wasn't bipolar. I was relieved, but still very stressed. I didn't know what was wrong with me. Time was ticking. I was starting to avoid my advisor completely. I also wasn't able to talk with my labmates or confront my research topic basically at all. Earlier this year, I was finally able to let go of my dumb on and off relationship with my ex. I found someone here who I fell for, but had a terrifying time realizing what it all meant. If anyone has ever seen Avatar, you might remember the episode where Zuko is having an identity crisis so bad it makes him physically sick. That totally happened to me. One night, my boyfriend was asking me about my past and my family. At first, I was answering in a guarded kind of way because I really don't like talking about it. But something started happening as I started to try to answer his questions. I started to feel like I was going to be extremely ill. My head hurt, my stomach was heaving, I had vertigo. It was 10 pm and I was so delusional I thought it might be morning sickness. I kept saying to him, 'where the hell am i going to get an abortion out here? Take me to a fucking hospital, clearly I'm pregnant and I can't be' etc etc. I was really crazy. I think he knew what was happening, so he told me to lie down and try to sleep it off. I sweat like crazy that night, it was awful. When I woke up, I felt like. a completely different person. I sat up and the bed was SOAKED. I got up and walked around and my boyfriend who slept on the floor next to me told me I slept for roughly 12 hours and asked how I felt. I told him I thought I knew what was wrong with me all these years. I realized I couldn't face my advisor or my work because the entire situation reminded me of my abusive father. Years of therapy didn't get me there, but he somehow did. So here I am. Now I understand why the hell I couldn't do my work this whole time. You'd think I would be ok now? Mm, not exactly. 2 weeks ago, my advisor let me know that I had until August 15th to show that I could finish my Masters in a sufficient timeframe, or else I would have to find myself another lab/university/job. I wasn't super surprised, but I was pretty upset about it. Who wants to find themselves in a situation where they fought tooth and nail to get somewhere -- to the dream spot and dream advisor and dream career path -- only to have it smashed by something like this? The only consolation I have right now is that regardless, I will be ok. I'm somehow getting engaged soon to the very supportive and lovely boyfriend. Life is crazy. It has definitely been insane these last 6 months. So I want to hear from ya'll. Do you'll know what to do when you're in a situation where past trauma leaves you unable to do your work? What do you do when you fancy a career change but. know you shouldn't, that's it's the demons talking? What happens after you get kicked out of your lab? What if the PI knows everyone in the field because it's a small fucking field? Do you stay in this lab where you feel you don't belong or bite the bullet and seek out a new one? What if your problems follow you? What if it's a combination of your problems and your PI's problems and you really just don't belong here (wrong place, wrong time) and. you should really just get out? I'm looking for a way to swallow the possibility of failure, because I'll be facing judgement from my family and people around me, as well as likely having a hard time getting back up and figuring out how to find a job or a new lab. I am also looking for anyone's advice who thinks I should ride this out. If so. how? Assume that simply talking with my advisor, like, I've tried that already. It's not easy. I know it's doable, but. it's really not a long term solution.

"Subpar postgrad experience. When I finished my undergrad I had two options: MRes at my present russell group uni, or an MSc at a uni which was far less prestigious. The MSc was a really interesting subject which I couldn't do anywhere else, also included a vocational placement to improve employability. So I thought, a lot of these modern polytechnic unis are really good nowadays, especially how they carve out a niche by forging links with employers and focusing on vocational aspects. Plus I'll still get an MSc which will be as good wherever it's from. Plus the fees and living costs were government funded, which sealed the deal. Now I really enjoyed the coursework in this course, didn't struggle with anything, graduated with a distinction. Got my head down, never really needed help, got straight A's. But I noticed a lot of my classmates were complaining ALL THE TIME. Loud, constant complaints which only grew as the course progressed. It got to the point people were openly saying to teaching staff that they wanted refunds. I just thought that people were complaining because they were struggling with the work, but towards the second half of the course I got some insight into many problems in the department. Trying to keep this short so I'll bullet point the things that affected me: * Placement started about two months late - ran well past the point the student loans stopped, leaving me in pretty severe poverty as I couldn't increase my hours in my paid employment with the placement taking up 20 hours a week. * Placement also ran through a fair chunk of the period supposed to be set aside for doing the MSc dissertation * They were clearly struggling for placement places, so I was in an organisation where it was practically impossible to meet the learning outcomes. Literally the type of work I was supposed to observe/practice wasn't being done at all. * When I raised issues with the placement, I was told to 'use my own contacts' to visit another agency to observe this type of work. I literally had to just phone up other organisations and beg to come in for a day! No facilitation from a uni who had sold me on the course due to their links with the sector, no help in literally meeting the basic requirements of the placement. * Some of the teaching staff were outstanding, but some had basically checked out. One guy would leave class halfway through saying he was going for an attendance sheet then just not return * There was a culture amongst some of the staff of being quite rude to students. I maintained good relations with every staff member in my undergrad, but received two extremely cheeky emails from staff members in this course. One was when my supervisor had forgotten to process my updated ethics form, then went on annual leave, so I had to sort it out with another staff member. Gave me an absolute dressing down by email about how much work it would be to sort out. Another was when my placement supervisor didn't turn up for a meeting, the uni placement coordinator just left before I got there, didn't inform me she'd left, then later blamed me in email for not sending my placement supervisor a reminder (I *had* reminded here a few days earlier). I noticed a lot of students seemed to be complaining about long drawn out email conflicts with certain staff members, but I thought 'that would never happen to me, I'm super polite and deferential'. I was wrong. * I'm just finding out that the MSc doesn't meet the research methods standards for ESRC PhD funding, which means that I need to do an MRes anyway before I can do doctoral training. * I was told at the start that if I do an MSc they'll be strongly encouraging me onto a PhD. Later I found out that they had no funded studentships at all and was told I should apply elsewhere. No support was provided in writing PhD proposals or navigating funding options, and I ended up getting all this sort of support from my previous university. I'm thinking back to when I had that choice between MRes at the uni I knew, or this new experience, and thinking I should have just done the MRes since I'll have to do one now anyway to get PhD funding. In it's defence, the course content was great and having an MSc distinction will make my application stronger than if I'd gone straight from undergrad. It's also given me a really good sense of the field and allowed me to explore and refine my research interests. Some of the staff were amazing, including my dissertation supervisor who has been a huge influence on my academic goals. However, the course organisation and some of the culture was an absolute mess.

"My college is not refunding my money for dropping a class two days late. What should I do? Please help. Hi, Thanks for stopping by my post. I have this problem that I only found reddit to be the appropriate place to share it. I am attending George Mason University as a junior. During the summer semester I signed up for 3 classes that were online. When the classes started, I found out that they are designed to be fast paced and required a lot of time and attention. I found it a little overwhelming being a full time employee and having the three classes. Off of the three classes I dropped one, because 1. It was very hard (database design class). 2. I could not understand the teacher. 3. The class required on campus attendance for tests, something which my job didn't allow. 4. I decided to take the class on campus later on than online and not learn anything. I found that the best course of action was to drop the class than end up failing it. What I wasn't aware of was that the deadline has passed and the college charges 50% of tuition and fees as a penalty. The class cost upwards of $1470 including the fees, and the college charged me $735 for dropping it two days late. Because of this charge I owe the university $593 including $53 in late fee. I explained to the college in an appeal letter that financially I am not able to pay that balance, but they kept on ignoring that and asking me to pay it. I used my pell grant for fall and spring semester and I had to take out loan for summer semester, because I used all my pell grant. I explained to the college that the money they charged me is student loan and I have repay it anyway, but they said it is not their problem. Since I can't come up with the payment for that $593 balance, they have put a hold on my account which impacts my registration for fall semester. I emailed the students accounts manager about this, and she replied back saying: pay the balance and we will lift the hold. I am running out of options. I have talked to the student accounts rep, supervisor, manager, and president. They all ignored my issue and told me that paying that balance is the only way. I could provide a copy of the email chain that I am sent to them so you guys can see their response. I can also provide a copy of the appeal letter I sent them. So what can I do to get that money back? Before you say that I should have been more responsible and solved it myself. Let me tell you this, mistakes happen. I wasn't aware of the deadline as it is my first time ever dropping a class. When you are a straight A student, you hardly ever feel the need to drop a class.

"Dealing with frequent absenteeism. Hello everyone. 22+ year vet here. I’m having a recurring problem and I thought I’d crowd source for potential solutions. I teach at a regional state university. I have large sections of freshman courses and I have a large teaching load with no TA’s (I’ve been stuck in a bad job due to being the second body ) One of my recurring problems is anytime I try to require in class work like quizzes or graded group activities I’m told I that I must give anyone who has an excused absence, including student athletes, a make up. Simply put I don’t have the bandwidth to schedule what tends to be somewhere in the order of 10-12 excused absence make up assessments each week.

"You have received some great information already. I will share a bit as we have 2 college students that both graduated without any debt. We did a LOT with scholarships and financial aid was a big piece of the puzzle for deciding where they went to school. For top tier schools such as Princeton, they do not give merit aid. Meaning, scholarships based upon your gpa or activities. However you can certainly bring in outside scholarships. And Princeton gives excellent need-based aid. So if your parents do not make a lot of money and you are a high-achieving student, apply to schools like Princeton, MIT, or Harvard. They can be very reasonably priced, depending on your parents' income. Most schools also have a aid/scholarship calculator where you can input income, test scores, etc and they will give you a rough idea of what you could expect to receive from the school. I would highly encourage you to also look for outside, non-school specific scholarships. With a school such as Princeton, (this is how it was several years ago so hopefully things have not changed), there is a cap in how much outside scholarships you can bring in with you. Freshman year it was a $1000 or two more than the rest of the years so you could purchase a computer. When my son was looking at Princeton, he could bring $6000 a year in outside scholarships. Anything over that amount, just reduced the amount of money they gave him. Our son had $8000 in outside scholarships and rather than waste the last $2000, he talked to one of the scholarships and asked if they would be willing to delay disbursement to him for a year so he could use it his sophomore year. He told them if that was not an option, please give that money to another student so it would be used. They were more than happy to wait a year and then mail him a check for $2000. Places to look for scholarships: - professional organizations for your major. One example is you are going into engineering, then look at Society of Women Engineers, or any other professional organizations. Similar to this is looking at companies in your field. Our son was an engineer major and received a 4 year renewing scholarship from Buick. Scholarships will also tell you if it is renewing (meaning they will give it to you multiple years), what the requirements are to renew it, or if it is a one-time/one-year scholarship. - Check your parents' employment companies and unions. Our son received a couple of scholarships from the different unions. - There are online scholarship search engines such as FastWeb. But this leads to another suggestion: Create a unique email for the college and scholarship search. Seriously, you. Will. Get. So. Much. Email. Just be sure to either check that inbox or have it forwarded. You do not want to miss the important stuff! - check your school website (both high school and college). Someone else mentioned college departmental awards, our high school offered several scholarships the kids were blessed to receive. Our daughter also looked closely at each school to see what scholarships were available. She applied for many school-specific scholarships. Some required essays, interviews, school visits, etc. But she received the top scholarships from 3 different schools, all of which were full-rides. So it was worth it to take a weekend and drive down to the school, do the program and interviews, and write the essay. It made for a pretty crazy senior year but was worth it. She ended up with over $300,000 in school bills fully covered. As someone else mentioned, schools may even pay you if there is money leftover after paying, tuition, fees, room, and board. Our daughter gets a deposit each semester. It is crazy (but great)! - organizations you are already a part of: Scouts, church/religious community, your job (I know around here several of common employers of high school students have scholarships). - take seriously the PSAT, SAT, and/or the ACT. Those test scores matter and can be an opportunity to see money come to you. Many libraries have free online test prep materials. Or buy a Princeton Review Cracking the SAT for $12 on Amazon. There seems to be more schools moving away from test scores, especially with COVID-19 and how that has messed with test taking. But if you are taking these tests, I would highly encourage you to put in a little test prep. Good luck! If this is the summer before your senior year, I would encourage you to start researching schools, crafting essays, looking at scholarships, etc. Check in with your high school counselor to see if there is a mailing list or database with scholarships. Let them know what you want and get them on your side to help! It is a lot of information but hang in there!

"Barring my father from all of my college decisions. Hi all, Not an easy post to make but I'll try to keep it brief. If this isn't the right subreddit/is against any rules I can delete this. My father and mother are in the process of divorce and he has been trying to harass me through email and trying to get access to my financial information. I am no longer able to access my FAFSA account and believe its because he has a parent account in his name that he's locked me out of by changing the information. I'm not sure what I can do at this point against him. I told the school he has no reason to be on campus to the security team as he has an order of protection against him, and I've told the financial aid office that he is not allowed to receive any of my information. However, I'm not able to get my FAFSA done still because it was under his name for some reason. How much am I able to deny him access to my college information? I want him to have no say in what happens and I'm afraid he's going to try and get me to the point where I can't afford to graduate. This has taken such a toll on my mental health ever since this all began months ago. I want to be done with him and cut him off but he insists on making my life hell and ruining me both financially and emotionally. I'm considering suing him personally for emotional distress and having him pay for all my counseling over the past 8 years. TL:DR, Trying to block abusive father from ruining my college finances and I'm overwhelmed by it all. Update: One year later, woah. So I had another situation that was pretty serious, but it got resolved. Ended up having to meet with the Financial Aid Head for a billing statement issue. They had sent out a bill to me and my father's email that **thankfully** only had our old home address on it. This could've been dangerous for reasons I don't think I need to state. My family was pretty pissed, but our meeting went absolutely amazing to my surprise. The director was highly sympathetic and shared his own testimony dealing with a similar situation on his end. It was an honest mistake and they owned up to it, which I appreciated a lot. Moving forward he has absolutely zero say in my schooling and has been blacklisted through IT.

"Take the AP or not. My Calculus class is called ""Analysis 1"" on my transcript and it ran from spring of sophomore year until fall of junior year. So I haven't looked at Calculus all semester and remeber very little. (I'm taking Statistics now.) The school considers the Analysis class to be ""aligned with"" AP Calculus BC, but the class had no direct relation to the AP units and had no MCQ or FRQ practice, so it's effectively a self-study AP at this point. I feel totally unprepared for the exam. Also, I have only used Desmos for Calculus work (which is allowed on the AP), but I don't have any programs or formulas saved in my TI-84, and I'm not familiar with those functions, so I feel like I would be at a disadvantage without the time to fully explore those features. I have 5 other APs I'm taking this year, with only 3 of them being for actual ""AP"" classes, and the other 2 supposedly being ""aligned with"" APs, but really more like self-study. If I cram for the 3 days I have between one AP and the Calc BC exam, I think I can get a 3, and I *may* be able to get a 4. I honestly don't think I can get a 5. Which would be worse - not reporting any Calc BC score on college apps or reporting a 3? Would reporting a 4 look bad?

"HELP! UW Seattle or UC Irvine for English. For context, I’m OOS for both schools and they’re my two cheapest options. I received scholarships that would help offset the costs (25k per year at Irvine and 10k per year at UW), so I can reasonably afford both schools. I’d be going into both schools with about 50 credits from AP’s and am aiming to graduate in three years, both for cost reasons and to get a head start on either completing my masters or going to law school. From what I can tell, UCI and UW both have strong English departments. UCI’s is more prestigious, while UW’s is larger and offers a concentration in creative writing that I’m interested in. I’d also like to either double major or pick up a minor in history or philosophy. Location-wise I’ve visited both campuses and loved both. I definitely prefer the Seattle area—I love being in the city and the proximity to nature is a big plus. Also, coming from a city on the east coast, I’m a fan of having actual seasons. I don’t mind Seattle’s rain at all. I’d also have family friends nearby at UW and I have a family member currently attending. While the weather in Irvine is beautiful, the area around campus is very suburban which I’m not crazy about. I’ve also heard it’s difficult to get anywhere without a car, which I wouldn’t have. The campus also isn’t as lively as UW’s—socially, I think UW would be better for me. If you couldn’t tell, I’ve been leaning towards UW. Still, it’s been difficult for me to justify my choice because, at the end of the day, UCI would be slightly cheaper and is generally ranked higher than UW. Would it be dumb to choose a more expensive (total cost of attendance for four years would be about 10k more expensive, 2.5k/year) and lower ranked school?

"I missed teaching, but now I'm teaching again and I hate it. EDIT: I've cooled down and thankfully they did a lot better in lab today. thank you guys for letting me rant I didn't teach in 2020 and I didn't like it because I felt unemployed and it was hard to get myself to do other stuff. but now I'm teaching again and I'm ready to go back to not teaching. I just need to vent. I technically only have 2 labs, but they're each split into 2 for social distancing. This evolution class does a lot of data analysis in R and that's all the labs have been so far, so I'm going over the activities and literally running around playing tech support for the entire time. 7 hours straight with only a half hour break between groups 2 and 3. My students, thank God, are at least polite this semester (that has not always been the case.) but I do wonder if about half of them only purchased their laptops the day before lab started, since they *do not* know how to use them. They're all gen Z, but I remember teaching my 80 year old grandma how to use her PC and that was easier. When I say tech support, I don't even mean with R most of the time, last week I had to spend the first 20 minutes of every lab section helping people find the files they downloaded because they could not find their downloads folders. These are all the students with brand new macbook pros, a computer I have never touched until now and I know how to use it better than them. On top of that, I've had 3 students both weeks so far (6 different students total) email saying they ""didn't know lab was this week."" When would it be? The schedule is like 5 different places on the course website and the syllabus. I understand the pandemic is hard for people, but it's hard for me too and I don't know why they think I can just make hours of time out of thin air to help people get caught up.

"Does anyone else feel like their university is not teaching them. Hey guys I am a 3rd year student in England and our university hasn't really taught us anything. Everything that we have done so far has had to go through a website and we haven't really had any discussions in lectures. Does anyone else find that their university is ripping them off in this way as it doesn't feel like I am actually having an education. An example is if we ask a question about a piece of work, their response will always be to check this website. It's very frustrating because the website tends to go down a lot and I can't always access the Internet. Lecturer's say they are trying to brace us for industry but it hardly feels like it.

"Professor gave me an unfair final grade and I don’t know what to do next. I’m honestly really confused and frustrated and could use some advice. All semester, my grades in this class were very solid. I did well on quizzes, assignments, and midterms. The only thing that pulled my average down a bit was group work. Even with that, I calculated my grade multiple times and I should have still finished in a higher grade range. After the final exam, I checked my student homepage and saw that final grades for the course were posted. It said I finished with a 63. That shocked me. For that to be true, I would’ve had to absolutely bomb the final exam like basically fail it which didn’t match how I felt leaving the exam at all. To sanity-check myself, I asked a classmate if we could compare our exam answers just to see where I might’ve gone wrong. Our answers were very similar. We also had almost identical grades throughout the semester. The difference? They ended the course with a completely fair final mark… and I somehow didn’t. So how does one of us pass comfortably while I’m barely scraping by (or failing) for essentially the same work? That’s where things start to feel off. Earlier in the semester, my professor gave my group assignment a 0% because of a technical issue on her end. I emailed her (politely) explaining the situation and pointed out that it wasn’t fair. She fixed it, but ever since then I can’t help but wonder if that email put a target on my back. Other than that, I’ve had zero issues with her and don’t see any reason I’d be graded differently from everyone else. I reached out asking for clarification, and now she says she wants to do a Teams call on Monday “to have evidence.” That wording alone feels weird and intimidating, like she’s already on the defensive or trying to protect herself rather than explain the grade. At this point, I genuinely don’t understand how my final mark makes sense mathematically or comparatively. It feels inconsistent, and possibly retaliatory, but I don’t want to jump to conclusions without handling this properly. what should I do from here? How do I prepare for this call? Should I be escalating this to the department or asking for a formal re-grade? Any advice would really help because I feel like I’m being punished for speaking up earlier, and I don’t want this to slide if it’s actually unfair",Academic,Medium,1.0,reddit:r/university,Medium,1,2373,423,0,Professor gave me an unfair final grade and I don’t know what to do next.,0

"Noise complaint from downstairs neighbor. So this isn't exactly a ""roommate troubles"" post, but kinda the same genre. I came back from class today to this note attached to my (off-campus, 2nd floor apartment) door: &gt; Hi! I live below you in [apt #] and I'm sure you don't do it on purpose (the walls are probably super thin) but I'm able to hear every little sound downstairs and it sounds like somebody's pounding from above. I'm okay with it during the day but I tend to go to bed pretty early (around 10pm), so would you mind keeping it down a little during the night after 10? I'm sorry - I really hate to complain but the past few weeks I've been woken up by noise around 11 - 11:30pm and I just have a hard time falling asleep after that so I thought I'd try asking you. Like I said, I'm not trying to be means so please don't take this the wrong way! Thank you.and I'm not really sure what to make of it. On one hand, I feel bad for disturbing my neighbor (I have a bit of social anxiety and this is actually a huge fear of mine come true). On the other hand, it's not like I do anything particularly rambunctious, I just move around my apartment like a normal person. I guess there might be something weird in the floor/ceiling that's amplifying the noise? I can't think of any way I could reasonably modify my behavior that would address this because it seems like it's just caused by my walking about. Anybody have any advice? What should I do? (Should I do anything?) I'm also a bit worried that this will escalate, since this person has already taken the step to complain after just a month. How are they going to feel after listening to me after six months? How are they going to feel when I have friends over and there is some actual noise being generated? (I haven't had many people over yet because I've been very slow to unpack, but it's going to happen) Could I get in some kind of trouble here? EDIT: So I'm probably going to leave a note saying something like ""Sorry for the noise, I'll try and be quiet but I don't think there's much I can do really"". Should I include a phone number on there? I feel like doing so would help show I do care and am not just trying to blow her off.

"Struggles with my advisor (Long Post). Hello everyone. I’m currently struggling in my relationship with my advisor. I am a 5th Year PhD candidate at my university. I have often had a tenuous relationship with my advisor but the more I sit with it the more I realize that it is possibly abusive. A few years ago I was reading a biography for my dissertation and I asked her for some tips on how to get the most out of a biography when reading it, since I knew she had written one. Instead she responded by telling me that she couldn’t believe that I asked her that question and I should know this already. Then she told me I should drop out of my university. I tried to get other Professors to back me up and instead my advisor scheduled an intervention and made me sit with her and another Professor while she listed the things I’m doing wrong in Grad school. After breaking down in front of her I left the meeting and attempted to take her advice. Shortly thereafter she told me that I had improved and things were better for awhile. One time I asked her for a letter of recommendation and she wrote one for me. I went to thank her afterwards and she told me not to thank her “because it’s her job and she shouldn’t be thanked for doing it.” Which I thought was a little strange. I often end my e-mails with a phrase of thanks to all of my professors and none of them seem to mind. But she got angry at me for “thanking her for her time” and told me to never do it again. As I studied for my Exam she started giving me weekly drill sessions where she would call me and ask me random trivia about the details of my field. It was during these meetings that I got increasingly stressed and frustrated with her behavior. If I got something wrong she would continually berate me for it, and told me that “I should know this material by now.” She also started prying too closely into my personal life asking questions about my exercise level and the amount of sleep I get. I told her that I was increasingly stressed and she started recommending me medication to help me sleep. Which was another red flag. The time came and she told me I was ready for my exam. I took it and ended up failing. I spoke to other graduate students in my department and they began to wonder if she had sabotaged me on purpose. I took several more months of her drill sessions and finally took my exam again and passed. I was willing to continue to work with her but I also began to speak to a professor who served as a graduate student coordinator and she suggested that I get a co-advisor to help mediate some of the effects of my advisor. After passing my candidacy exam I continued to work on my dissertation. I wrote and expanded on a chapter and sent it to her for feedback. She read three pages of it and refused to read any further because of grammatical mistakes. She then started berating me for not catching my mistakes and not proofreading, despite having proofread it multiple times and having other professors look over it. I ended up working closely with the writing center at my university to fix many of my grammatical errors and I sent it to her again. She read one sentence found an issue with a comma and refused to read anymore and continued to insult me for not proofreading despite literally working with a proofreading service. I decided to reach out to the graduate student coordinator and the department chair with my issues. And they recommended that I work on getting a co-advisor. There is another professor in the department who I have a close relationship with so I asked her if she would be willing to be a co-advisor and she responded that she would. After conferring with the department chair and the graduate student coordinator, I contacted my advisor and asked if she would be willing to be a co-advisor. And she responded saying that she was not okay with being a co-advisor. Because she didn’t believe that anyone in the department had co-advisors. And she was angry that I talked to the other professor first before discussing it with her. I contacted the graduate student coordinator again and she e-mailed my advisor and explained that it was possible to have a co-advisor but my advisor again refused because she “didn’t think it would be good for me.” But that she was willing to let the other professor be my main advisor and that she could still serve on my committee. We had a conference over Zoom this weekend and she didn’t attend my panel but attended a panel an hour later for one of the other grad students in the department. At this conference she received an award. I decided to finally reach out to her again and congratulate her on winning the award and how it was well-deserved. I updated her on my presentation and the good news I received from it. And I sent her my chapter and some of my writings again now that they have all been closely read by the writing center. She responded today and completely ignored the entirety of her message and then told me I needed to decide whether I wanted to keep her as my advisor or not. I responded that I did want to keep her as my advisor. She e-mailed me back again and berated me for not telling her that I wanted a co-advisor first and that it reeked of unprofessionalism. She told me to really think about whether or not I want her to be my main advisor and let her know tomorrow. I was completely willing to work with her despite all of the insults she hurls at me. But the way she responded to my e-mail with even more insults finally made me decide that I want to switch advisors because I don’t think I can ever have a positive relationship with her after all of this. But the problem is I’m applying for 6th year funding and I need a letter from my advisor. If I keep her as my advisor I’m worried she won’t write me a positive letter, and if I switch advisors I’m worried that the other advisor won’t have a chance to write a letter for me. I’ve been in contact with the department chair and the grad student coordinator and they told me that there really isn’t a good option going forward. So I’m not sure what to do. This relationship has caused me a ton of stress and prevents me from sleeping and has actually caused me to have physical illness in my interactions with her. I’ve tried to do everything I can think of to maintain a positive relationship with her but she seems unwilling to do so. She has also, in the past, been prevented from having graduate students for over 20 years. There was apparently an issue with her and a graduate student and they decided in favor of the student. I’m her first graduate student since then. I’m just not sure she understands how to be an advisor. As it stands it’s been over a year since she’s read any of my work on my dissertation. It’s really disappointing because I think she’s absolutely brilliant and she’s an amazing writer. But I’m terrified of her and her interactions with me have made graduate school much harder. She also doesn’t seem to have a good relationship with any other graduate students because they are also afraid of her, and supposedly she doesn’t have a good relationship with other Professors in the department either. Any suggestions would be appreciated. TL;DR: My advisor told me to drop out, recommended me drugs, regularly insults me and refuses to let me have a co-advisor. And I need a letter for 6th year funding next week",Academic,Medium,1.0,web:reddit:r/gradschool:search:attendance issue,Medium,2,7386,1366,0,Struggles with my advisor (Long Post).,0

"[Education] Accepted to both of my top Masters programs, help me decide. I've been admitted to all the programs I applied for except for my safety (no word yet, idgaf) I am debating Teachers College - **Columbia University's ""MA-Science Education""** and **Johns Hopkins University's ""MAT (Masters of Arts in Teaching)""** programs (focus on a secondary science subject but I don't want to be too transparent because I'm probably the only admitted with my background) I am probably receiving a few eye-rolls about how much thought I am putting into a measly education masters (esp. because I want to teach, cmon!), but if you're dropping 50k for a degree it's on par with buying a luxury car ie: where can I get the most bang for my buck? My intents with the degree I choose is to spend a few years in the classroom to get an insight and awareness of classroom environment and how it works, working with students, and what it's like to be a teacher. I already have classroom experience and love working with teenagers (it is very encouraging and humbling to see 18 year olds cheer about being able to graduate high school). I plan on using my experiences to inform me of where I want to go next in education, but ideally that involves applying to a PhD program. As someone with a hard science background and research experience, I'd love to be involved in educational research or curriculum development. And not pertaining to education, but just a general life goal in general, get the fuck out of DC so the PhD ideally should be a program about 4+ hours away from where I am now. so here are pros and cons I'm weighing for each: **both:** 1. virtually identical # of credits (36 vs 39) 2. virtually identical coursework (diversity / urban awareness types, special ed, teaching in the science classroom, etc. ) 3. both high ranked, competitive schools. Both look good on paper, but whether I come out with more is another a thing which is elaborated below. 4. both place an emphasis on cognitive sciences in education which is a major interest of mine. **Columbia pros:** 1. Ideally pursue my PhD in Science Education, Cognitive Studies in Ed., or School Psychology (I know, DIFFERENT!) here or a similar caliber school. They have a lot of options here and their school of education is top ranked. 2. I'd imagine with the ivy league status there IDEALLY is ample opportunity to connect with professors and find careers. Very good to mingle with potential advisors and/or other important people in the field. **Columbia cons:** 1. massive student body. I've read it's like a ""diploma mill"" and therefore a rather un-intimate setting. 2. hella expensive- assuming I don't land a scholarship or a grant I'll be in 50k debt for the tuition alone. Don't even want to think about the room &amp; board. **Hopkins pros:** 1. there's a program that route that I can choose that will take me a year longer to finish, but my degree is virtually paid for. (free school!) I think it's a 2 year service contract afterwards, but during, I get a paid long-term sub position (~180 a day, not bad) and my starting salary as a teacher will be $51k/year. 2. currently the #1 education dept in the US! This means a buttload in terms of teacher education, so this is a huge pro. I feel like I'd probably get a better education here for the sake of intimacy in the classroom setting and probably professors / lecturers giving more of a shit. (see above complaint about class sizes @ TC). 3. got a good feeling right off the bat being able to meet my advisor and talk to them 1v1 during my interview about what this program / school has to offer. They indicated that they're always looking for RAs and they are footing a massive NSF grant currently. From all intents and purposes and knowing I probably might be their only MAT mentee on this particular subject. 4. they get a shitton of funding. I don't know so much for the ""notoriety"" of their education professors, but they probably have a few reputable ones though seeing that they're #1? 5. close to home, no moving costs, no dealing with stress of moving and being away from my SO. 6. for whatever god forsaken reason i don't leave this area I wouldn't mind going federal which can be used to my advantage at @JHU because of their deep connections in the area. **Hopkins cons:** 1. I am unsure if just the name of the MAT alone pigeon-holes me into ""just"" teaching, despite the virtually identical coursework. I feel Columbia's Science Ed. MA title allows more flexibility (HOWEVER, I do recognize that there are a few professors with MATs as their masters work so not all hope is lost). 2. I don't want to be seen as someone who is too uncomfortable to be more than an hour or away from home! I don't want to be seen as constantly choosing a ""safe"" choice due to proximity and price. 3. not very interested in their PhD program; it's a PhD in Education, and you can gear it towards a science education topic, but I want something a little more specific (granted I understand where your PhD ends up is at the student's discretion.) Not to mention, I don't want to stay in Maryland, simply put. 4. there probably is a service contract with the program that gives me virtually free tuition which conflicts with my ""gtfo"" theory. My main gripe about staying here esp. as an educator is that the politics in this county (esp in education) are STIFLING. The parents are incredibly entitled and I'd rather end up as headmaster in a small school for like 35k a year in Kansas than get paid 51k fielding lawsuits from wives of attorneys who want to sue my ass for giving Billy a B+ or not answering an email on a Saturday. SO, if I turn down this contract, there will be no obligation, but then. I'll have to pay 40k tuition. :) 5. year longer to finish means I'll be 26 by the time I start teaching, I want to put in a minimum of 4 years of teaching before going off to PhD, idk, issues with starting PhDs ""too late?"" I feel like my gut tells me JHU because getting to know your faculty is light years better than a neutral acquaintance with an ivy league professor. And I do not want to slight JHU just because it does not have the ivy title; I can tell they run a tight ship as it is! And how many people can say they got through both their undergrad and masters with little to no student debt?

"&gt;The second conflict simmers behind the scenes: a faculty civil war that pits medical doctors and engineers against political scientists and humanities scholars over how to handle pro-Palestinian demonstrations that have disrupted campus life. &gt;In February, well before Trump made Columbia exhibit A in his effort to reshape elite colleges, seven Jewish faculty from the engineering, medical, and business schools, along with prominent deans and a representative for Jewish alumni, met with Columbia interim President Katrina Armstrong. They asked her to get ahead of Trump’s moves by implementing a series of restrictions on protesters, including banning masks on campus, according to people in attendance. This is a really shitty situation. As a physician scientist, I want to support my colleagues in the humanities because what they are doing is important for our society, and anti-intellectuals are trying to split institutions of higher learning. On the other hand, science and medicine are even more dependent on research dollars. Physician scientists are looking at a 20-25 year process from the end of undergraduate training to their first NIH R grant, often having sacrificed much more lucrative careers to pursue this route (as I'm sure our colleagues in the humanities have done). Generally, there is a very finite window to take advantage of early investigator status. We recognize that things are unfair. In fact, perhaps to an even greater extent than graduate or postdoc, the entire residency system is predicated on exploiting the fact that trainees have to put up with abuse and don't have the ability to speak out. Is there a way for medical doctors, scientists, and engineers to still support our colleagues in the humanities, while they demonstrate their support for important issues in a way that minimizes the risk to funding? (I also am not sure what else Columbia University could have done to comply, nor the sincerity of the stated reason for cancellation of funding, but drawing further attention to this situation does not help matters.)",Attendance,Medium,1.0,web:pullpush:r/academia:comment:unfair,Medium,1,2072,328,2,&gt;The second conflict simmers behind the scenes: a faculty civil war that pits medical doctors and engineers against political scientists and humanities scholars over how to handle pro-Palestinian demonstrations that h,0

"If you are experiencing a mental health crisis or need immediate support, you are not alone. We don’t talk about mental health issues enough. I had a relative who had clinical depression for over 30 years, and his symptoms include extreme emotions (super happy or supper sad or super angry or super fearful), insomnia, anxiety, and sometimes even hallucinations (he grab his passport and think he needs to run away somewhere to stay safe). I used to think that he’s just a selfish, impatient, and ill-tempered person. But over the years I’ve come to accept that a lot of this is due to his depression. Not everyone in the family has accepted it unfortunately, even though we all know he is diagnosed with depression. Anyway, I wrote a post regarding how to find mental health resources and what are the options out there, because a lot of people don’t know where to find them apparently. I hope this will help many of you. It’s important to figure out mental health issues early on (especially in college when you are away from family support). My relative has been on medication for decades. Can you imagine if he was not properly diagnosed? :O Please let me know what you think or anything you think should be added to it. You can read it on the site [here](https://stellarlane.com/blog/mental-health-resources-in-college) or below: &amp;#x200B; Mental health in college students was at a crisis point even *before* the pandemic started. But COVID-19 has exacerbated the amount of stress, anxiety, depression, and other diagnosable mental illnesses in college students. Many students still don’t know where to find mental health resources in college, though. Keep reading for: * a snapshot of mental health trends on college campuses, before and during COVID-19 * college campus mental health services and how to find them * off-campus mental health resources * how and why to get disability accommodations for a mental illness * how to manage a mental illness in college Use these resources, and share this information with someone else who is struggling. But before we go any further: ## If you are experiencing a mental health crisis or need immediate support: * Call your school’s counseling services center. The phone number can be found on your school’s student affairs website. * Call 911 or go to your nearest emergency room if you are in danger of hurting yourself or others. * Call school police, who can escort you to counseling centers or the emergency room. Calling them won’t get you into trouble, or anything negative. They are simply there to get you the help you need. * Contact the National Suicide Prevention Hotline at 1-800-273-8255, or use Lifeline Chat (suicidepreventionlifeline.org/chat/) if you cannot call. * Text BRAVE to 741-741 to reach the National Alliance on Mental Illness crisis chat line. ## Mental Health By the Numbers Even before the pandemic hit, college students' mental health was on the decline. In 2019, studies conducted by the National Alliance on Mental Illness showed: * 25% of students have been diagnosed or treated for a mental health condition in the past year (2018) * 35% of college students are struggling with mental health problems * 27% of college students in the US are diagnosed with depression * 11% of college students have been diagnosed with anxiety * 57.7% of college students confessed that they have felt “overwhelming anxiety” in the prior year * 50% of students admit to having suicidal thoughts * Only 9% of college students decide to seek professional help on campus * 73.1% of counseling center directors report a significant increase of severe mental health issues in college students These statistics show the upward trend of mental illness in colleges, but don’t reflect how COVID-19 has shifted the mental health outlook. ## How has COVID-19 affected college students' mental health and wellbeing? According to Active Minds, a nonprofit dedicated to spreading mental health awareness and advocacy efforts, conducts biannual surveys measuring the state of mental health in college students. After surveying 2086 college students about the effect of COVID-19 on mental health in April 2020, they found the following: * 1 in 5 college students say their mental health has *significantly* worsened due to COVID-19 * 80% of college students say COVID-19 has negatively impacted their mental health * 55% of college students would not know where to go if they or someone they knew needed mental health services right away ## On-Campus Mental Health Resources: What’s available? Many campuses will host students on campus and provide regular services again as everyone continues to get the vaccines available. But the delivery of mental health resources may vary, with many campuses offering telehealth services in addition to, or instead of, in-person appointments. In general, though, most college campuses offer these mental health services: * consultations on academic issues or personal stressors * drop-in hours for students who really need to work through high stress or crisis situations * short-term individual therapy * group therapy (usually lasting six to eight weeks, or throughout the semester) * psychiatric care (on a case-by-case basis) * assistance with finding more permanent treatment providers (this service is known as care coordination) * coping skills workshops (to manage anxiety, stress, feelings of depression, etc.) If you’re not sure what all your campus has to offer, use this campus mental health service search tool to find out (ulifeline.org/get\_help\_now). ## How to Access On-Campus Mental Health Services ## Drop-In Student Mental Health Services If your campus has drop-in mental health services, then you don’t need to schedule an appointment. All you have to do is walk into (or call) your campus wellness center during designated drop-in hours and ask to speak to someone about whatever’s on your mind. Just make sure to check your school’s website to find out whether to physically go or call campus mental health services — social distancing policies are changing constantly. Schools may also continue to offer telehealth services after COVID-19, so you could still have that option, if it’s more convenient for you. Use drop-in mental health services when you: * are in a mental health crisis * need short term support as you work through distressing emotions * need help making a big decision (like whether to drop a class or move back home) Once you are connected with a counseling professional, they will usually talk you through your situation and teach you some coping skills to handle distress in the future. They will talk to you for however long you need, but drop-in sessions usually last around an hour at most. They may schedule an appointment to speak with you again, but usually drop-in appointments are one-and-done. ## Therapy for College Students If you have been experiencing intense sadness, nervousness, insomnia, anxiety, depression, irregular eating or exercise habits, or any other problems you would like long-term help with, you will have to schedule an intake appointment with a counseling professional to talk about getting more help. You can find out how to schedule an appointment on your school’s student affairs webpage. They will most likely require you to fill out some forms before your appointment. These usually include questions about your concerns and any previous mental/physical health problems you have faced. They may ask you for insurance information. **If you don’t have insurance, still schedule the campus intake appointment** and talk to your school about your options. During your appointment, you and a trained professional will decide how to meet your individual needs. You may receive short-term individual therapy with someone on campus. Usually, counselors work with students for three to eight sessions to process short-term stressors. You may also be directed towards group therapy, which usually lasts 6-8 weeks. Groups may specialize in anxiety support, emotion management, substance use, graduate student issues, etc. These will vary by institution. However, if you need more long-term care, campus counselors may connect you to mental health professionals in your community. Counseling centers do this to keep clinicians available for other students who need them. Your counselor will draw up a list of providers in the community that accept your insurance (if you have any.) They will also help you email, call, and follow up if you are afraid to make the call, or forget to. ## Psychiatric Services Some campuses have licensed psychiatrists available to prescribe medications for students who require them. If you are not already taking medications to manage a mental illness, you may be able to set up an appointment with a campus psychiatrist. But you may have to wait a while before you can get an appointment, as campus psychiatrists are in relatively high demand. Campus psychiatrists will most likely assist you in finding someone in the community to help you manage new medications. ## Off-Campus Mental Health Resources for College Students When it comes to getting help, you aren’t limited to what your campus can offer. You’re also not limited to traditional mental health services. ## Individual Services You don’t need to have a referral from someone on campus to meet with a professional in your area. Search for therapists, psychiatrists, treatment centers, and support groups using Psychology Today or Mental Health Match. You can filter results by specialization, availability, gender, religion, sexuality, and treatment practice to find someone who: * has experience treating your personal issues and/or mental illness * you are comfortable being around (e.g. a woman may prefer to have a woman for a therapist) * understands your values (e.g. your religion or philosophy) * has availability at the time you need it Consider your academic and biological schedule when you make your first appointment: are you able to consistently wake up in the morning? Are you sure you will always be available at the time you schedule your sessions for? Missed appointments don’t usually get covered by insurance, and many professionals have a late fee, cancellation policy, etc. Be mindful of this when you schedule that first appointment. ## Online Support Groups Online support groups are widely available now, in part because of COVID-19. They offer access to support for people who usually can’t afford to travel or pay for traditional therapy. This is an extensive list of online support groups (mhanational.org/find-support-groups) from Mental Health America. ## Self Care and Coping Skills Resources Self care is any activity that you intentionally do to take care of your mental, physical, and/or emotional health. Practicing self care will help you manage your stress and calm yourself down when you need to. It’s not a replacement for professional help. But it can really improve your wellbeing if you incorporate self care into your routine. This can be anything from a gentle walk, to doing something creative, to calling a friend just to talk. Self care is not staying up late watching something on Netflix. It’s more intentional and restorative than that. ## COVID-19 Mental Health Resources There are so many resources out there for students affected by COVID-19. The Jed Foundation, which was founded by parents who lost their son to suicide, is dedicated to raising mental health awareness, suicide prevention, and providing mental health resources to young adults, especially college students. They have provided a massive COVID-19 resource guide to help students cope throughout the pandemic. Even as things get back to normal, the coping skills you learn during a crisis like COVID-19 can be used for the rest of your life. You’re going to be stressed over lots of things, so the skills never become irrelevant. ## How to Manage Mental Illness While in College ## Be proud of yourself. You are handling school and your mental health, at the same time, and that’s impressive! You’re doing great things and you really should be proud of yourself. ## Leave any embarrassment behind. If you think you’re the only student on campus struggling with mental illness, you’re so wrong. 20% of college students have a diagnosable mental illness, remember? It’s normal to struggle, normal to ask for help, *and* normal to take medication for an illness. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. So try as hard as you can to leave any shame or embarrassment you feel about your mental illness in the past. ## Consider disability accommodations. While you absolutely can succeed in school with a mental illness, you probably need different things than your peers to reach that success. Your school (and the federal government) understands this, which is why disability accommodations exist. There are physical and mental disability accommodations available at every learning institution. Mental health accommodations include, but are not limited to: * testing at an alternate location to minimize distractions * extra time to test, which helps minimize anxiety * an extended number of absences (within reason) * access to peer notes or audio recordings of notes * more time to complete assignments (within reason) * assistance with assignments and scheduling during hospitalization These do not all apply in the remote learning setting, of course. Testing conditions, especially, have changed in the remote learning setting, for obvious reasons. Students usually request and use accommodations if they are having trouble focusing, adjusting to new medications, or managing symptoms of a disorder (such as fatigue or insomnia.) Start by looking up your school’s disability services department information. You will probably have to schedule an intake appointment with someone from the disability services department. Before your appointment, you will need to provide documentation of your disability, including: * the name of the professional who diagnosed you * any medications you are currently on * symptoms you are experiencing * prior hospitalizations due to your illness At your appointment, they will ask what accommodations you think you need. It’s probably not a great idea to go in and ask to never have to attend class or to be able to turn in any assignment late without discussing it with a professor first. Be reasonable with your requests. You will probably have a meeting with someone from disability resources every semester, so you can reevaluate accommodations as needed. If you get accommodations for your disability, you do have to disclose the fact that you have a disability to any professor whose class you wish to use your accommodations in. The disclosure process is regulated by disability services. For example, let’s say you have a calculus class that tests. You have test anxiety, which is why you have testing accommodations like extra time and testing in a private room. If you want to use your accommodations in this class, you have to tell them that you have a disability, and the accommodation, *but* you don’t have to tell them that you have test anxiety. You will most likely have an online account with disability services, where you can choose which professors and TAs to send disability/accommodation disclosure documents to. ## Create an open line of communication with your professors and TAs. You don’t have to tell any professor anything specific about your mental illness. But it can be helpful to tell them about any symptoms you may be experiencing, any problems you foresee in the future, and anything they can do to help. For example, if you know that your depression gets worse in the winter, let your professors know ahead of time that you may have some difficulty getting to class on time or finishing assignments promptly. Professors and TAs know how stressful college is, and if you don’t use your illness a san excuse to procrastinate, then they will sympathize with you. ## Manage medications (if you take any.) College is generally a little hectic and you’ve probably got a lot going on right now. But if you take medications for a mental illness, then making sure you get the right dose at the right time is your first priority, always. Set timers to remind yourself to take medications, pick up scripts, and go to appointments. Ask roommates and parents to help you remember, if you need someone else to remind you. ## Stick to a routine (seriously, it helps.) You've heard it before, several times — eat, sleep, drink water, and study at regular intervals, and your life will really improve. By now it almost sounds cliché, but a balanced routine (or as balanced as possible) can change your life. Just getting up in the morning and having a filling breakfast can make all the difference in your day. ## Get extra help with your courses when you need it. If you notice that you’re slipping up because you missed class or couldn’t focus, take action now. Get a classmate or hire an affordable online tutor to work with you 1-on-1 in whatever subject you’re struggling with. Make sure to play catch up as soon as you notice you’re slipping, so you don’t fall even more behind. ## Practice self-compassion. You face different challenges than many of your peers. Even other people with the same mental illness struggle in unique ways. So you’re not all going to succeed on the same level and at the same pace. You may not get fantastic grades if you have anxiety flare ups. You may not be very present in class if you’re adjusting to new bipolar medication. You may have to take a semester off to get treatment for an eating disorder. Acknowledge the struggle, and be proud that you showed up to school in spite of it. And know that you will succeed if you continue working on your mental health. ## You can succeed, even if you’re struggling right now. Thousands of people with mental illness graduated last year. Thousands of students will do it this year. Use these mental health resources to take care of yourself, and you can be another person who graduates in spite of all the challenges that come with mental illness. &amp;#x200B; To see my post with links to resources, you can visit my site [here](https://stellarlane.com/blog/mental-health-resources-in-college)",Examination,Medium,1.0,web:reddit:r/college:search:fee issue,Medium,2,18307,2986,5,"If you are experiencing a mental health crisis or need immediate support, you are not alone.",0

"What's your extra credit policy. Mine is that I sometimes (at my discretion) offer extra credit opportunities for the whole class but never to individuals.

I tell my students about the opportunity and tell them I will \[raise their next test grade by two points, drop an additional weekly journal assignment grade, etc.\] if they attend AND come find me at the conference. I then set up a Google doc to facilitate carpooling between classmates (and students who really can't find a ride can ride with me) and the school pays their attendance fees.

"My College Career Has Been a Complete Failure, Any Advice. Here's a little backstory, I graduated high school with a 3.9 GPA, which would have been higher if I had not messed around Freshman year. I got back on track and took on several leadership roles in clubs and on sports teams during high school. My siblings all went to extremely respected universities, and are all very successful in their careers. My parents never really thought college was for me, but they still pushed me towards going, and have taken it upon themselves to help their youngest child(me), with some of the financial costs of college. I had no idea what I wanted to do after college, or even what I wanted to study, but I went in hopes I would figure those things out. My freshman year was a great year for me, I ended up making deans list and was active in Student Government and a coed business fraternity. The issues I faced that year came from my unhappiness with my choice in the university I attended, the social group I found myself in, and the degree I chose. I decided to stick with the university and I changed degrees to something I thought I would enjoy more, but this is where things took a turn for me. Sophomore year had several issues arise, one being an extremely toxic relationship with a partner that was both physically and mentally abusive, and my grandfather fell ill suddenly and passed after a month or so of battling the disease. I was taking mostly online classes at that time, and I was the only grandchild who was physically capable of being there, so I decided to stay at home for a month or so while he was sick. My grades took a turn, and the problems I faced prior to my grandfathers illness persisted. So once the semester was coming to a close, I decided to transfer to another school. The school I chose was one I knew very well. It was about 30 minutes from my home, I spent a lot of time in the town the school was in, and I knew some people who went there from high school. It seemed at first the perfect school for me, there was a great music scene, which I appreciated because I had wanted to start a band for a long time. The area was gorgeous, and I was already familiar with the area. Once I got to this school I faced severe depression due to the isolation I felt in the beginning. I had left the social group I spent two years getting to know, and anyone who transfers can attest to how scary it is to leave what you had behind for something new. My grades suffered due to my depression, but I did well overall. However, one class that absolutely tanked my gpa was one I did all the work for, and had an A in the class until my professor dropped me down to a C over my final paper. There were no explanations, no corrections, and when asked to discuss it, they never responded. Spring Semester came around and I am by far at my lowest ever. More family issues arose, that took a lot of my time away from studies. I found a job to make ends meet with rent and necessities, but in order to make enough I had to work more than I should have. I contracted pneumonia about 2 weeks into the semester, and that took me away from class for about 3-4 weeks. I don't want to make this a pity party for myself, I have some other issues that came about but are not worth mentioning due to the length of this post. I also fully acknowledge life is hard, and you either rise to the occasion or fall short when the pressure is too much. I am here to simply ask for some advice, the semester is about 3 weeks away from being over, and I can already say I will either fail one or two of my classes, and there's no ability to drop them. One professor offered to take some late assignments, but I don't think they will bring me to a passing grade. Another professor never responded to any of my emails over the semester, so I have completely given up on that class. I am at a very high chance of being on academic probation, and I have lost all confidence and hope in myself to bounce back. This is a lot, and I apologize in advance, but I don't know what to do. I can't drop out, I can't take a semester off, and I just don't know what to do. Anyone who has had similar experience in college, our made the comeback, how did you do it? Anyone who can provide insight, it is greatly appreciated. I know some of this sounds hard to believe, but I assure you this is as honest of a retelling as it possibly can be without becoming a whole biography.

"I pushback against those type of students' behavior but the majority of my colleagues acquiesce to them. They are afraid to challenge students on cheating and lies because students will: unleash the tears and sad stories, become ""outraged and offended"" that the instructor accused them of cheating (which they were), or take their complaints straight to the chair, dean, or college president's office (their favorite go-to).

"Third Year PhD student, funding got cut, no idea what to do, faculty are ghosting me. Hello, I am a third-year PhD student in the US (I am a US citizen), and I was employed by a research institution that essentially funded my PhD. Because of widespread budget cuts to science, my position that was intended to last throughout my PhD, and was my primary source of employment, even though at “half-time” hours, was cut abruptly. Basically, I got an email from my supervisor telling me sorry, you have been doing great, but we don’t have funds for you anymore, so your term ends at the end of this year. This means that any work I was doing with this supervisor, my “boss”, that was supposed to contribute to my PhD as a collaboration, is now over. Still, the PhD grind moves on, as I need to prepare for QE, assemble my committee, finish classes, and prepare my first manuscript for publication. I reached out to our department graduate advisor, and while polite, they gave me a hollow “I don’t know how to help you” answer. I asked my academic advisor for guidance, and they just told me they do not know any funding sources, and then went silent. I found out about my funding cut well after applications for teaching assistant positions were already due. I have been cold emailing research faculty and staff asking if they had any way I could work as a research assistant, but so far no leads. If anything, it feels like the faculty in my department have ghosted me, and I cannot tell if they would even notice if I just dropped out. I have tried so hard to be friendly and supportive of the faculty in my program, always showing up when help was needed with department events and support with research collaborations, trying my best to ask smart and insightful questions when guest speakers present to make them feel valued, so it is a bit disappointing to feel like everyone is just distancing themselves from me, especially after having shown so much enthusiasm for my work this past year. I even asked the graduate advisor what the process is for dropping out for a semester, and they didn’t really know how to answer that. I legit have no idea what I am doing now, this has been super stressful, and the uncertainty about what even happens next semester is causing me a lot of anxiety. I am even considering just ""paying"" for next semester out-of-pocket from my savings. I realize this is a very unpopular idea and overall how horrible a look this would be, but am I really just going to ""throw away"" my PhD like that? I currently have no job, but that does not change me needing to submit a 30-page research report this Friday, have a journal submission-ready manuscript ready in a few days, and have presentation-ready materials necessary to demonstrate my progress this semester and suitability for QEs, all hinging on python coding issues I am still diagnosing. I feel so ashamed writing about this here and even bringing this issue up with my advisor and program, because even though I honestly feel I am doing good work that advances the research of our program, and have overall performed quite well academically, I feel like my funding situation makes me a complete burden on the department, as if the faculty might lament ""I knew this student would be a problem down the line!"", as if I am just a liability at this point.

"Another complaint about collaborations and boundaries, I suppose. It‘s me again, just venting. This is my first post doc position. I am at an absolute loss here and just sad and disillusioned. Six months ago, the head of my institute invited a member of his own team, my team leader, another team leader, and me to suggest a new data analysis based on our large cohort data. The cohort is in the disease I was hired to study. My team leader is a consultant-level medical doctor so he was very busy and couldn‘t attend, he told me so in person. I went to the meeting. The project was discussed. After the meeting, I sent everyone, including my absent team leader, minutes and an update on first data explorations. My team leader responded, asking me what this was. I emailed him to explain. In September, I sent a progress update for this project to everyone. He responded again, asking me what this was and I explained again. In June, August, October, November and December, my team leader received general project updates from me (a list with projects, which journals or development stages they were at.). This problem project was on them every time. Once, he replied to tell me that it was regrettable that he hadn‘t heard of this problem project. I replied again, reminding him of the problem project. (I am labeling this as the problem project post-hoc, so to say). The head of my institute is a co-authors on all our papers and we frequently request his input for manuscripts and study designs. He once emailed me to ask me to proofread an analysis write up and help with the statistics behind it. For this, he gave me a co-authorship. As this was not considerable work, I did not think to request permission from my own team leader. My team leader had also previously told me that the idea of the institute was to facilitate free flowing exchange of knowledge.anyway, the head of institute ALSO didn‘t request my team leader‘s permission to add me as co-author. And then the paper was published and all hell broke loose because of the head of institute‘s incredible faux-pas of adding me as co-author without getting permission from my team leader. Everyone was furious with HIM. And now, I‘m in the fantastic situation where my team leader has instructed me as follows: do not generally reject all collaboration invitations, do not generally accept all invitations, do not email HIM to ask permission every time, decide on my own if I want to do any invited projects or not, but without any guidance at all about when to say yes or no. This is already really shitty. The other week I helped a co-worker from head of institute‘s team who usually does qualitative analysis with her quantitative analysis that she hadn‘t done in years. She offered me a co-authorship that I had to turn down (I‘d only offered to help her because she was kinda insecure, I wanted to be a good co-worker). So, the problem project was now ready to fully launch and I wanted input from my team leader. So I emailed him. He ignored my email. On the phone, he then told me he wasn‘t interested in the project, and it wasn‘t okay for me to have started this project behind his back with the HOI. Which was NOT what happened. He could have told me 6 months ago he didn‘t want to do this project. Anyway, I tried to talk to my team leader about this and he was very negative. And I tried to let the other team leader know what had happened and he also seemed to blame me. He told me, again, how very very angry everyone was at the head of institute for that paper with me on it and how it was a massive, massive faux-pas. And I was trying to let him know I was uncertain how to proceed or not with the project (as HOI‘s people are working on it and results are coming). And I wouldn‘t bring up the project at the next strategy meeting til I‘d decided how to behave. Anyway, his phone cut off mid-conversation. I could hear his kids playing in the background but when I rang back, he didn‘t pick up. He might be very busy because he has three kids at home but I know feel completely isolated in my team, and unwanted. I feel like whenever I have any issue now, this „everyone is livid at HOI“ thing is going to come back to me. And even though my team leader and I had talked things out afterward, it seems to not have gone away. I genuinely didn‘t know I should have rejected HOI‘s request for help writing up this analysis and arguing it in the paper",Attendance,Medium,1.0,web:pullpush:r/academia:submission:complaint,Medium,1,4429,811,2,"Another complaint about collaborations and boundaries, I suppose.",0
"Am I cooked like Arizona pot roast for or no? (be honest and tell me what to do). Okay guys to keep a mega story short, I got super sick this year, missed tons of class and had a first semester avg. of F (like an 18%). All my teachers knew this and refused to give me the classwork to do online. I came back from missing a bunch of school (this is a public school by the way) and was told I couldn't fix my grades. My mom got involved, I get sick again and behold, my mom gets an email. What does that email say? They kicked me out of school. No warning, no phone call, text message, letter or nothing. Okay so while I'm crashing out on the inside (because as an older sibling, I never break the fourth wall), I came up with a plan. I was going to retake some of the classes, graduate early (so I have a year to focus on my health and my super cool activities that mean so much to me and my college applications), finish my associates (cause I've been taking dual enrollment since freshman year), get some medical certificate, and go to an ivy next year. Problem you may ask? The people that signs off my early graduation? They say that they don't want to do it (literally said that they want me to do senior year, unprofessional right?) because they want me to have a senior year experience (I'M CHRONICALLY ILL?) and drum roll please the finishing touch. I can only retake AP Bio but I have to wait until June and the rest of my Fs and that one D ( I had 3 Fs and 1 D), I can't redo. In order for me to graduate early (which is near impossible at this rate) I have to be done by June (yes, the same day to apply to redo AP Bio). Right now, I'm homeschooled cause I'm super sick and I have a GPA of 3.6 (which is not bad with literal Fs on it) but I'm trying to do cray things and that requires a 3.9 (I had a 3.93 before this year cooking me like dinner) and now I feel mega cooked 3000 because I have always wanted to go to an ivy league out of my state because my family were intense opps to me as a kid and I want to prove them wrong internally so that the inner child and me feels like I'm smart enough to be surrounded by smart kids that care about doing well (not to mention some of these colleges have CRAZY classes and you CANNOT tell me they don't sound interesting). So what now? I have no idea. That is where you guys come in because not even ChatGPT knows what to tell me. By the way I was thinking of suing but my family is going through enough and I work at an insurance place online (because now I have freee timee yay!) and I want to be a heart surgeon when I get older. Here are my Questions : 1. Should I keep pushing for graduating early? 2. What should I do about my Fs and 1 D? (also there is a thing we have called grade forgivness but 2 of the Fs are AICE classes) 3. Should I just finish my associates or wait until I get into college (cause apparently the transfer admissions are muchhhh lower from ives) 4. If I stay in high school, should I just load up on online APs? (I never really took any besides this year because I felt stupid but I took dual enrollment? odd, yes but that was my thinking at 13.) 5. Also, after this year and if I have to transfer to high school, I kind of don't want to go back to that school because of how ruthless they treated me at my lowest. I have a scholarship to go to private school but it's not full ride, and the school that is the closet to me has all the kids from middle school that ruined it for me. My mom wants me to get a diploma and walk across the stage. So what is my next high school step if I do stay? Homeschool (no diploma), Private school (lowkey would need extra shifts at mrs. insurance place), Public school I went to (the school opps), or Public school I'm close to (the kid opps) 6.

"Situation of Indian Colleges/People. So, Hey Internet People,I wanted to share something. After my 12th, I appeared for JEE(Indian Engineering Enterence Exam) and got into this private college. I honestly thought, ""It's alright, it's what I deserve. I will work hard for four years, get a job, and then follow what my heart says."" And since it’s a private college, I assumed there wouldn't be much ragging from seniors. I was right—seniors don’t even interact with us that frequently. But something happened yesterday. There was a chemistry lab session at the start of the day. However, some students had not been attending the theory classes, so the Head of Chemistry didn’t allow them to enter the lab. As the day progressed, I felt it was better than the last two days, which were not great for me. I’m known for attending most of the classes because I don’t feel good at my PG (paying guest accommodation), so I prefer spending time in class. After the lab, I attended: C Programming &amp; Chemistry But some students didn’t want to attend the mathematics class. I asked them why, and they said they were doing a mass bunk (skipping class together). When I asked again why they were bunking, a girl from my section told me not to attend the class. Then, a boy next to her said, ""Bhai, she's asking so sweetly."" I replied, ""I’m not such a big SIMP that I’ll skip class just because a girl asks me to."" Then, out of nowhere, the girl and a boy started pulling my bag out of the classroom. I held my bag tight but hesitated because I was afraid that if I touched the girl by mistake, she might complain the authority about it. So, I let them take my bag. But then, when the boy was holding my bag outside the classroom and telling me to come out, I followed him and tried to take my bag back. I told him, ""If you don’t want to attend, don’t. But I want to."" That made him angry, and he said, ""Zayda Ho Raha Hai "" meaning, He’s getting out of hand. He was about to punch me. The Class Representative (CR) standing next to him said, ""We’ll deal with him later."" I got scared and called my dad. He told me, ""Go home, why get into a fight?"" So, I left the classroom (but some students were still in classroom) and went to the library to study on my own. But after what had happened, I couldn’t focus at all. A guy from my section told me, ""Class is still happening."" Some students had returned to attend the class. But I still didn’t go back. I went home, then later waited for the aptitude class to end. Afterward, I told the Aptitude Coach everything (she asked us to call her Coach instead of Ma’am). I told her, ""I just need advice on what to do,"" because I wasn’t able to focus on my studies. But after I told her what had happened, students attending the aptitude class surrounded us. She told me, ""You could have told your friends."" I replied, ""Whom should I trust?"" And I was right. Some A-hole told the same guys who forced me not to attend the class. Now, one of their friends—whose roll number is very close to mine—has messaged me, asking if I complained. And now I’m scared as hell. And if you think I’m weak just because my college doesn’t have ragging, you’re wrong. I’ve handled a lot of things—bullying, and even S-Abuse once, My Geography Teached held my bottoms for an uncomfortable amount of time. I could have handled this too, but when I saw that guy at that moment, I felt like he was about to kill me. I just don’t want to die like this. My parents have spent so much money on me. At the very least, I want to give them a decent retired life before I die.

"Is it not good to ask a math teacher for course clearance for basic prerequisite classes when I took precalculus in highschool but did horrible on the math placement test. First of all, I'm not a student who slacks off, I organize my time to do work, study, and review- but I did horrible with my course placement test for my community college (wanted to save money). In my highschool it was pretty much alright to use calculators all the time so taking a placement test without calculators kind of crippled my mathematic skills. (Yes, I am working on not being dependent on my calculator). I talked with my community college counselor about waiving off some math classes and immediately starting with Pre calculus or college algebra. I already got a B+ in my highschool precalculus class and I'm worried that e-mailing a math professor who I never met in person will make me seem like a greedy or some kind of jerk student.

"In college without much financial support. What should I do. I (19M) am at a community college just getting my AA right now and I've been becoming more and more disheartened by the fact that I don't have much financial support. That, and I'm not really sure what I'm doing here. My parents are immigrants so they always told my brother and I growing up that going to college is essentially the way to become comfortable and successful and how they'd support us. You know, the usual. The problem is, I don't have much financial support. They told me to take out loans and that they'd help pay for books and that's really it. I did the FAFSA but all I got was 5500 in Unsubsidized loans for both this semester and next semester total. Last semester I did I got, I think, 2500 in Subsidized loans but I only took 1750. I didn't qualify for grants or anything. I really don't like the idea of taking out loans and having a debt and it just becoming higher and higher. My parents even told me that they're both still paying off their loans to this day. That's so saddening to me. I recently got a new job but it's part time minimum wage and I don't have many hours as of now so that's not going to help me out. I have an Internship with Disney starting next year so maybe that could help me a bit? It also sucks that a lot of people are getting degrees and having trouble finding employment, or just getting a crappy pay when they have a Master's Degree. I want to be able to make something of myself and I don't know, be someone I can be proud of. Make some sort of comfortable living. I've always thought about pursuing Psychology or Social Work and becoming a LCSW or going into research if I don't like the clinical side. It's the financial side that worries me.

The midterm and final (35% each) had some multiple choice, with a focus on short answer questions that could be fairly vague in my opinion. The assignment (30%) also had pretty vague instructions, and the TA's seemed to refuse to give anything above a 90% even if it was perfect.

"How to deal with unfair professor. I am a first year masters student studying math. I am funded by the department as a research and teaching assistant. I am taking a real analysis class with about 10 other people. I feel that the professor is grading me very unfairly, and I would like advice on how to deal with this situation. I have several examples of this. * If a problem says ""Prove A"", and if I prove it in a way he doesn't expect, sometimes he refuses to grade it. If I ask him what I did wrong, he'll say ""I didn't expect it to be done like this."" If I ask him to go through it to see if I made any mistakes, he'll refuse. * Sometimes if I do a problem in a different way than he expects, he'll mark me off but not put what I did wrong. I've asked him what I did wrong, and he'll say ""You didn't get the problem wrong, but I wanted you to do it using."" even though the directions only said prove, and the method I used to prove it was already discussed and proved in class. I've asked classmates to see their solution to compare after they were handed back, and they used the same method I did but received full credit. * On one homework problem, I received 16/20 on it with no written explanation of what I did wrong. I asked a classmate to see his solution. He literally wrote the same thing I did word-for-word and received a perfect 20/20. He refused to go over this problem with me. He just said ""I think it could have been written better"". * On my first exam on his first time grading the exam, I received 100%. He went through it at least 3 or 4 times, and my grade fell to 80% the lowest in the class. I was literally the only one in the class that he graded multiple times. * On my second exam, we were asked to prove set A = set B. I first proved A subset of B, then I proved B subset of A. He wrote on the first part of the proof, ""This isn't enough to show A = B. You need to show B subset of A"". Literally half an inch below that was my proof for the second part but was ungraded. By this point, I was too exasperated with him to ask him about it. There are more examples of this. Each time I talk to him it is never confrontational. I am always calm and polite. I just say ""Can you please explain this to me?"" Or something similar. I saw one of my classmates literally yelling at him and cussing him out, and this person still gets graded fairly and consistently with the other students. This professor is the assistant head of the department and my graduate coordinator. He handles all contracts. Part of the contract says that if I have unsatisfactory academic progress or any host of reasons I can lose my funding. This makes sense to me because they can't have failing students being funded since not all students are able to be funded. I am afraid to complain too much because this professor writes and grades one of my comprehensive exams that I need to pass to graduate. Also, I don't want to be viewed as a trouble maker to the entire department because I might lose my funding. I know one PhD student in her last year that said she knew someone who got on this professor's bad side and lost his funding even though his grades were great and did his teaching assistant duties excellently.

Berkeley or Tufts. Basically I've been crashing out over whether or not I should choose Berkeley or Tufts for my undergrad. I'll go through some pros and cons of both and also cost isn't an issue.

"Research Internship vs Staying for Research. Hello everyone! I recently received an opportunity to travel abroad for a few months to work on a research project at another university. I have been struggling trying to decide whether or not it would be worth it for me to go, and I figured that I could get insight from more experienced researchers here! For context, I am studying Computer Science, currently completing my Master's and hoping to continue to a Ph.D. (either at the same university or a different one). The pros of taking this opportunity (as far as I can see) are: * I gain experience and academic diversity * It is fully paid for * Going abroad would be kind of nice The cons (again, as far as I can think): * The research area is in a subfield that I have little experience in, and likely not the subfield I would like to focus on in my Ph.D. (though maybe this could broaden my background/knowledge?) * While the professor is great and the past works seem interesting, the professors that I work with at my university are certainly ""bigger names"" / more well-known. * Not a huge issue (more of a side thing) but I am on a prescription for a year, and going abroad might make that a bit complicated (although still doable).

I failed almost ALL MY CLASSES that half. I have to extend to a 5th year which will be without my scholarship due to the university's policy. I just wanted a break.

I was also a social butterfly who had tons of friends and everything was. All the adults in my life always overhyped and praised me for being so exemplary; My family, family friends, made me feel like I could do anything in the world. But then, 8th grade--- 2021---- humbled me in ways I didn’t expect. That was the year everything changed. I thought that I had figured it all out, but boy was I wrong! That year, I soon started to realize how fragile all my dreams were compared to the harsh world. My parents’ divorce was the first crack in the perfect life I had imagined for myself. That day forced me to see the world differently. I started to really grasp the instability of life and how easily things could fall apart, even though everything seemed fine on the surface. That change made me more aware of how corrupt our world is, and how ly it needed to be fixed. However, that perspective change didn’t just stop at home, the realization pushed me to look further and make connections between the vulnerability I felt in my life, to the damages happening all over around us, not just to people, but to the planet. As I started paying more attention to the world around me, I began to notice how, especially in America, how most of the world prioritized wanting to profit over people and the planet. Its recently become clear to me that many of our issues I cared about, from inequality to climate change, were deeply connected to something bigger: capitalism.

When you’re trying to figure out whether an academic writing service is legit, transparency is the first thing to look for. Reputable platforms like [https://writeessaytoday.com/](https://writeessaytoday.com/) clearly explain what kind of help they offer, how pricing works and what students should expect. If a site hides contact details, guarantees grades or promises undetectable work, that’s usually a red flag. Another good sign is realistic positioning. Legitimate services focus on support such as editing, feedback, structure, formatting and research guidance rather than encouraging academic dishonesty. They also explain revision policies, timelines and limits instead of overpromising instant results. Finally look outside the website itself.

"To Future PTK members! Here's my thoughts on it. PTK is known as Phi Thetta Kappa that is only for students who are in the top 10% of their school. I got sent an invite a while back and decided to do some research and saw many comments saying it was legit and worth it. It's $99 and is a one-time payment, so I though it would be a good deal, but legit when I checked it out, none of it was related to me. Like, yes, I am going to be a transfer student perhaps, but not even my major was on there. Their courses are very general, and I have sadly not felt that it was worth the price. The thing that bugs me the most, is because it's a paid service to get very general things, and I didn't see many internships on their pages either. I even went to one of their meetings one time, and they said they offer job opportunities, yet on there page, there was nothing of the sort. \-- From my experience, here are some things I suggest doing, that I SHOULD have done better! 1. **Do more research!** I only did enough to know it was legit, and that I came across several posts and people I talked to in order to see that I thought it was worth it. And by people I mean, the members, my advisor &amp; counselor and some other peeps on reddt. But you should also check out the official reddit for PTK, as well as users who have complaints about it to understand both sides and have a better perspective on things. 2. **Make sure to know that your school has PTK benefits!** A large portion of why students go for PTK is because of the benefits they get when they transfer, but even then the scholarships are not guaranteed. They do make it glimmer, but at the end of the day, it's whether they are in your favor, should you consider it. 3. **Talk to PTK members.** Before anything, also look for people who have already signed up. Because I never actually knew what the service looked like beforehand, I was super confident in thinking it was worth it. But when I was ACTUALLY given access, it was very underwhelming. \-- Please note, that this is just my personal opinion on PTK since I basically got 0 benefits after signing up. And be aware, that when you talk to some PTK representatives, it is possible they also advertise and make the service brighter and glow more than how it truly is. *At the end of the day,* ***It's all about if you want it and if it's worth it to YOU!*** And I respect that!

"Professor Assigning Work After Semester Ends. Hello all, In my honors class, we are using this program called Soliya where you talk to people for 8 weeks from other countries. The issue with this is that it ends about 2 weeks after the grading period/semester ends and final grades are due. The other section of our honors program that is doing this is not obligated to finish this after our grading period ends. However, our professor said they would give our whole class IC grades which i thought was unfair so I went to the head of the honors program and also there was no syllabus so I reported that as well. Then in class, the professor called the student who said something a liar (sorry that you were held accountable) and suddenly there was a complete syllabus. Furthermore, the prof says we all have to fill out a contract saying we would complete this program and that if we didn't, they are allowed to change our grade. I looked in the faculty Handbook and it says a prof can only change grades if they miscalculate or make an error, so this would not qualify in my interpretation. Is it unreasonable for my peers and I to be upset that we have to continue doing classwork for 2 weeks after our grades are finalized? People have internships and jobs that start.

"TEACHERS NEED TO KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH BASIC STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH. They dont have awareness and I was physically harmed and almost banned from boards. because of a minor panic attack. in between my 12th board exam, i had a minor panic attack and couldn't finish a question, my paper was snatched away, completely reasonable of course, and I silently put my head down to not get any unnecessary attention until it passed. the invigilator went to the front and yelled with all her might- ""Well next exam, learn to manage your time better girl, and you won't be crying. \*chuckles\* Your generation just likes to cry and complain I imagine"" And she asked me to look at her while she spoke. The ENTIRE class with 50 students looked up at me. It was horrible. I quietly asked if I could use the washroom- our papers were taken so we should be free to leave right? she denied twice and when i asked the third time she let me. my legs and hands were shaking and i could barely walk. The entire school was staring at me. note, this was still a minor attack. i locked myself in a stall, sat in a corner and cried and shook just waiting for it to get over, usually doesn't take more than 5 minutes. Up till this point it was manageable. here's when it got worse. First few of the women security on the floor knocked on my door to see if I was okay. With a lot of difficulty I reached up and opened the door. Through stammering I tried explaining that I'm fine, and that this is a routine. They left. I locked the door. Then, my invigilator and another teacher BANGED on my door, and that sudden very loud noise increased my heart rate more. I opened, and they wanted me to get out immediately and go to the infirmary. I guess they were afraid I would commit suicide and that they would be responsible for it, which is honestly very understandable. They kept saying that too- that the school will be held responsible if anything happens to me. I was barely processing anything I was completely dissociated. Stammering I tried to speak as much as I could, but they just kept speaking over me. I was telling them I needed a minute, and I'll be just fine. I get that they don't understand anxiety. I wasn't going to not cooperate or anything. The invigilator yelled at me and made me stand up. As though I did something wrong lol. There was a huge crowd near the bathroom- it was a big scene, so much stimulus, which is exactly why I lock myself in enclosed spaces to cut off stimulus. But they don't know or understand that, they were just worried about very normal things that they would have to face. I stood up, tried explaining my condition one last time. Then, the other teacher said to the invigilator, ""Should we just call security?"" cutting me off. In a very condescending tone. thats when i realised they weren't going to listen to me, i kept my mouth shut. the invigilator DRAGGED me out of the stall. Like literally gripped my elbows and YANKED me out. i had red marks above my elbow until next morning- just to let you know the intensity with which I was pulled. i just shut up, washed my face, and walked out while 100s stared at me. my hands were still shaking. my heart was still palpitating. but i could walk. kinda. THEN LMAO THEY WROTE A LETTER TO MY SCHOOL STATING THEY'RE GONNA TAKE ACTION FOR MISBEHAVIOUR AND DISOBEDIENCE AND WRITE A LETTER TO CBSE. LIKE? my school obviously called my parents, who dont believe in mental health lol, and my mom took a day off from work just to hit me and yell at me lol, for all the unnecessary ruckus i create. bottomline, another person could've had a way worse panic attack, and if it were treated this way, all the noise, physical harshness, and just everything in general could have caused genuine harm. even physical. this is not okay. this is literal endangerment to students suffering from anxiety.

"Is University still worth doing during this Covid Apocalypse. **Backgounf Info:** I'm 30years old and moved from Melbourne to Adelaide to start uni in the hopes I could meet people at uni or at work and it wouldn’t be such a big deal. That was 2 weeks ago, needless to say, I haven't met anyone really, I haven't started any job and now can't get employment. I don't know anyone in Adelaide and I don’t have permanent accommodation. Going back to Melbourne would be my only option as my parents will let me live with them rent free (thanks mumsie). **The Situation:** Uni has closed its doors. Everything is online. I'm doing a ***Bachelor of Science*** for context I'm tossing up whether to stay in Uni or not. Seems pointless as we might not get any contact hours for 4-9 months. Each subject only runs for 1 Semester, which means the rest of the semester is online AT LEAST but could be the rest of the year. In some degrees that would work fine, but not so much in Science degrees. **Arguments to stay:** 1. I can't get a job anyway, might as well be student NOW rather than when I can get a job. 2. What else is there to do in a jobless apocalypse. 3. Might still get a degree in 3 years with some knowledge in environmental Science **Arguments against:** 1. Potentially going a year without lab/prac work 2. Uncertain Future, who knows what's going to happen with HECS(Student loan system in Australia) - I could pull out now an not pay or owe anything 3.

"A compilation of complaints against Mr. Admeeted. **EDIT**: Mr. Admeeted responds to allegations [here.](https://imgur.com/a/YNoKxEW) I first heard of Mr. Admeeted through a few reddit group chats. Multiple people were complaining about how he would not stop talking about his app, Admeeted in admitted student groupchats. Then, someone posted [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/g0gtzx/you_shouldnt_be_allowed_to_join_admitted_students/?amp%253Bamp%253Bamp%253Butm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp%253Bamp%253Bamp%253Butm_name=iossmf) which provided a lot of information on why people dislike him. Even after nicely asked to leave from some groupchats (and being forcibly kicked from others), **he would not stop.** [Here’s some evidence.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/g0gtzx/you_shouldnt_be_allowed_to_join_admitted_students/fnbtre9/) He also claimed that he was staying in these groupchats because he was deciding between schools and weighing financial aid. However, Harvard provides very generous financial aid, and furthermore, he had already commited by April 9th according to [this instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/B-xNICTBL9H/). What’s more, he is a Coca Cola Scholar according to their website [here.](https://www.coca-colascholarsfoundation.org/blog/our-2020-coke-scholars/) **It seems that Dalbert is inconsistent and unreliable, at least so far**. While the spam is annoying, it’s understandable that he wants to promote his product.

[In this comment,](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gb1eyd/remember_the_harvard_guy_advertising_his_website/fp46qzz/) Mr. Admeeted says this: “First, Admeeted has never made any revenue: there is no profiteering here. 1) Everything has always been free. 2) There are no ads.”. Yet, not does he claim that he has attracted venture capital attention [here,](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/4/23/harvard-coronavirus-visitas-admeeted/) but Admeeted is registered as a for profit company (see censored screenshot [here](https://coinsh.red/ipfs/QmZjaJs85N88RzfoZtUDpBVQnXxS2ARNgaBJnhj15ZA2Ve?filename=yeeted-admeeted.png)). To elaborate, venture capitalists would only be interested if Admeeted is or will be profitable, which goes against what he claims: “no profiteering here”. Mr. Admeeted also claims that (in the same comment) that “this has never been on my LinkedIn resume, nor any resume for that matter. I just want to help people”. Like I mentioned, this company is is registered as a for profit, not for helping people, and he has already talked to venture capital investors. Strictly speaking, while it is technically not on his Linked resume, he created a post on Linkedin about his “startup” and looking for people to hire [here.](https://ibb.co/pZyxY8S). He is also hiring on the Harvard careers website (same description). See [here](https://imgur.com/s4SaWMQ) and [here.](https://imgur.com/RuF8wmr) The next part of his comment addresses the dispute in removal of some people who helped him create Admeeted. According to him, “there was initially a team of volunteers that wanted to help me with my project - however, due to family emergencies and other reasons it became difficult to work with a group, so before any major contributions were made I thanked them for their support and they all agreed amiably to leave. There was not even a website at that point. I absolutely give credit where it is due, but in this case, the final product and website bear no contributions by those initial volunteers.” (Comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gb1eyd/remember_the_harvard_guy_advertising_his_website/fp46qzz/)). I’ll address the allegations in a bit, but I just find it hilarious that he copied/pasted this exact message in defense of himself in a GroupMe [here](https://imgur.com/a/wf5NX8l). Guess you have to stay pretty consistent with your lies if you don’t wanna get caught. With regards to his claim, a person who worked on it (comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gb1eyd/remember_the_harvard_guy_advertising_his_website/fp453pw/) says that they were removed without really agreeing to it. Furthermore, while not illegal, it seems wrong that these people who helped set up the website get no recognition or pay while Dalbert is hiring people and paying them (picture [here](https://ibb.co/pZyxY8S)). Another developer came forward and provided a similar perspective [here](https://imgur.com/L0aOnnc). It seems that the “volunteer” team put in significant work (contrary to what Dalbert claims) and that he plans to put ads on it, despite his claim that Admeeted is not for profit. Here is [yet another developer perspective](https://imgur.com/a/vNeTfHQ). &amp;nbsp; Just as a side note, he had a google form on his instagram asking for anyone who wanted to promote his app. Basically, the form asked them to copy/paste a message asking people to join Admeeted, since he is probably banned from most admitted student chats. The form is gone now, so you’ll just have to take my word for it. Here's a screenshot that someone managed to grab: https://imgur.com/gallery/JRmz9Yo There is some other suspicious stuff going on as well.

Defending the creator of Admeeted, but definitely deleted some other comments that were probably more blatantly defending him (seeing as he’s at -8 karma and he only has two comments at 0 upvotes). u/Atleasthesnotavirgin. Again, defending him, with some choice language. No posts or comments since then. He has two more removed comments insulting other people on the same post. u/zainali02. Older account, but hopped in the thread to defend Dalbert. Has no posts/comments on A2C before that. And one really weird comment [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gb1eyd/remember_the_harvard_guy_advertising_his_website/fp41t4v/) u/karenthethrowaway/. Another throwaway account created the day of the first thread. Only activity is the old thread (3 comments, 2 of which are removed) and then another post linking to the newer thread. That being said, there are some a lot of all bashing Dalbert in this thread, so who really knows what’s going on. Here are a few: u/fuckalbie123, u/throwaway_ploopy, u/throwaway92838381, u/titi0808. It seems that most of these are throwaway accounts. Perhaps they are involved with Dalbert or know someone who did. To me, the whole thread is suspicious--there are a lot of people on both sides attacking and defending the person with equal vigor. &amp;nbsp; Lastly, there is some really suspicious stuff going on with r/admeeted. It was created by u/Saholy, but they are no longer even a mod. The only moderator is u/SubjectBend, who has some strange comments like [this.](https://www.removeddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gb1eyd/remember_the_harvard_guy_advertising_his_website/fp44td4/) (I had to use removeddit since they deleted the comment). It seems like they’re trying to drive traffic towards r/admeeted, for whatever reason. I talked with them, and while it is not Dalbert, they admitted that they know him personally and that Dalbert wanted them to work on the Admeeted project. I have no clue what is going on here, but it just seems off to me. &amp;nbsp; I have only presented the facts (or what appear to be the facts) so far. Dalbert has also been accused of trying to get people’s acceptances rescinded when they tried to remove him from their group chat or talked bad about Admeeted. If anyone can provide evidence of this, that would be great. **I have also heard that a group of developers who had worked on the project are planning to compile evidence and come forward.** Here is a direct quote: “We're planning to do a more formal release with hard receipts showing the work that we've done, as well as a combined testimonial from as many people as we can get in contact with, but we'd like to try and emphasize that we don't wish to spread any hate on him as a person or have him rescinded for his actions. We just want him to own up to his mistakes, give credit where it's due, and make sure that he doesn't continue to profit off of stolen work.” &amp;nbsp; **In conclusion**: I have simply compiled all the evidence on Reddit and the contradictions between Albert’s claims and other people’s claims.

"I wonder why your mother wants to give you anxiety about going to college. Theft can occur in any group of people, whether it's a college dorm or a gym locker room or an apartment in the suburbs. In my experience of college, which was granted quite a few years ago, I never had anything stolen. In fact, the opposite: I lost my wallet and it was turned in, cash still in it, to the lost and found. Most people aren't crap. Five to eight people a room? Is she mixing up college and prison? In a university dorm you will probably have a roommate, though some schools do offer single rooms for an extra fee. One roommate. Some universities have suites, where you have four or more people sharing space, but they're usually double rooms connected to a common space. My university not only allowed microwaves, they supplied them. But some schools do have rules about that. If you don't have a microwave in your room, though, there will be one in the student lounge or dorm kitchen that you can use. There are certainly some frustrations about living in the dorms (there can be, in some dorms, a lot of noise, for example). But there are also a lot of fun things about living on campus. For one thing, it's very easy to make friends if you're living in the dorms. Lots of people around, hanging out in the student lounge, that sort of thing.

"A few questions about grad school from an undergrad student. I'm a mathematics major in my first year of undergrad. I'm looking for some advice from someone who's further along than I am. My goal is to pursue a PhD in mathematics or a related field. I might end up pursuing graduate studies in biology or programming with my bachelor's in mathematics. I'm not entirely sure. However, I know for a fact that I want to stay in academia for the most part when I leave college. I'd really like to attend a school with a top mathematics program at some point in my life; I want to be able to experience that. However, these top schools are usually really expensive. I've considered getting my masters at one of these schools just for the purpose of getting to experience the school for a few years, and then going to a cheaper school for PhD. Is that a smart move? (as opposed to going straight from bach. to PhD) Financially and professionally, what's the best thing to do? I was also wondering how grad programs feel about taking things slowly in undergrad. I've jammed all of my lower division classes into my freshman year; I'm taking 24 credit hours this semester and will be taking 18 next semester. So far, there hasn't been an issue (surprisingly!). I have a 4.0. My rationale is that lower division mathematics courses are not as bad as the higher ones; if I push myself now, I'll be able to slow down later and only take 3-4 classes at a time with only 1 ""hard"" class per semester, assuming I take a summer semester at some point along the line.

"Should I ask for retake. So basically I wanted to ask my professor this question even though I know the answer would probably be no. Basically I had a math exam today which I studied all week for hours for. The teacher allowed each student to bring a double sided printer paper that we could write anything on such as formulas and notes. I thought this was very generous but it really was necessary to do well on the exam. I had my exam later in the day but I knew that I should be getting there early and getting my paper printed early. I got to the library an hour early (to print and study a bit). Come to find out that my account to print was glitchy. Basically I could not print on my account and the staff nor could It really do anything to fix it. We were probably trying to fix it for 30 minutes and I ended up putting $20 into my printing balance to try to fix it (even though I already had money in the account) but I still couldn’t manage to get it fixed. I am sure that I eventually could have gotten the paper printed if IT could have used there account to print it for me, but they refused. At that point I was really running late for my exam so I went to my exam in a hurry without a formula sheet. I felt incredibly disadvantaged because every single student had a formula sheet but I didn’t. I know it was my responsibly to get one, but it’s not fair that my account was glitched and unable to print it out. I literally sat in my desk crying because I did all that studying and preparation (writing the formulae sheet) just for me to do bad on the exam.

"First, I don't have access to pay schedules for tenured professors so my initial post was in regards to the OP whom sounded like they had not been granted tenure. I have seen plenty of postings for adjuncts and know post docs so I'm familiar with those and I have seen job postings for upper admin folks and there is a significant pay gap. Why? Idk I can speculate all day but it doesn't mean anything. If you own and operate a business you are going to invest your money in the parts of your business that make money. A harsh reality (I respect my professors so take this for what it is) no one, until you are in grad school selecting your committee, chooses a school based off of one professor that they might get for one or two classes for a semester. Bringing that back to the initial point from the business perspective it is not readily apparent that investing in professors is something that will directly increase enrollment. How? The greater admin structure controls everything so they can design it however they want. This sentence is speculative but it feels apparent to me that it is structured as a business rather than a service. Couple examples that are objective that support this (my experience is in Arizona so know that is my frame of reference); marketing materials that focus on an extremely specialized type of research that you will not be allowed near unless you are a PhD atudent, lavish dorms that are resort like, campuses that make up a city but most of the class rooms are empty, yearly tuition markups even though the material is mostly the same, new programs being offered that aren't going to produce competitive job placement but money so why not offer them, etc. All of those things are not chosen by professors they are chosen by the greater admin structure. Bringing all my speculation together. admin policies are investable because in their minds they are revenue generating and professors are an expenditure. Similarly Americans have been indoctrinated into thinking university is the only thing that will allow them to move on in a career. So knowing it is considered a necessity the uni can charge whatever",Academic,Medium,1.0,web:pullpush:r/academia:comment:dorm,Medium,1,2147,376,0,"First, I don't have access to pay schedules for tenured professors so my initial post was in regards to the OP whom sounded like they had not been granted tenure.",0

"My time is running out to find a co-op. Is a leave of absence to focus on my co-op search overkill or should I last-minute enroll in classes? And would it be a bad decision to take a temp job that pays well but might distract me from my search. I've been searching for an internship/Co-op in my field (Software Engineering), as required to graduate with my degree. I was planning to have my Co-op set for this upcoming fall semester but I've really been struggling in my search and haven't landed anything. As of right now, I need to either 1. Get a Co-op for the fall semester, 2. Quickly attempt to enroll in classes and go to school in August, OR 3. Take a leave of absence for a semester to stay home and focus on my Co-op search and pay $700 to cancel school housing. It seems highly unlikely that I'd get a Co-op by August at this point. As for classes, I'm running out of classes to take, as most of my remaining courses are to be taken after I've had my co-op experience. Also, I've never had luck trying to apply for Co-ops while being enrolled in classes, I always struggle in my classes and my applications go untouched for months, so option 2 is really just postponing my Co-op struggle until January. Option 3 is looking to be my ""best"" option by default, which fills me with dread. There is a lot of dead time when going through application processes, especially for Co-ops that are recruiting 3 seasons in advance. I've never NOT been in school during the typical school year. Feeling like I'm not doing anything ""real"" with my time while falling behind everyone else taking classes would absolutely kill me. I know that if I take the leave of absence, the majority of my time will be spent being disappointed in myself and fretting over being behind in my degree plan. An additional complication to my issue is that I've applied to a short-term (5 weeks July-August) summer job program on a whim, not realizing how it may conflict with my current situation. This ""job"" is more like a paid learning experience for young adults, it's 100% no experience necessary, any career path welcome, and seems really fun. I've been looking forward to it. The job pays well, more than any real job I've had before. The money would be nice to have after that $700 cancellation fee if I take a leave of absence, which again, seems to be the most likely outcome. However, the job timeline would conflict with campus move-in and the beginning of classes, or the job hours might conflict if I receive any interview requests for Co-ops. Should I prioritize my Co-op search and take a leave of absence, or attempt to enroll in classes to avoid the housing cancellation fee and application process ""dead time""? Should I take the summer job knowing I might leave the program early to begin classes? If I don't enroll in classes, should I take the job knowing I might sacrifice either my performance at the job in favor of my co-op search, or the intensity of my co-op search in favor of the job? Or not take the job at all and miss out on the money and fun? Any general advice regarding my situation and circumstances? Thank you for reading this long post and thank you in advanced for your advice. Edit: Some details I left out that might make things make a bit more sense; I have a few extraneous classes I would be able to take this semester IF I am able to enroll in them. After that, my degree is essentially on pause until I get a co-op.

"Bit off more than I can chew and now I'm crashing and burning. I felt like I was lazy for most of college so I started really pushing my limits for my first semester of senior year. It felt great at first - I enrolled in five classes because it felt manageable for the first month. I took on a part-time research job, and made some meaningful accomplishments in it. But soon enough I had little downtime, and the few hours I did have, I didn't have the energy to use well. Setbacks started happening and the lack of give in my schedule caught up to me. I keep getting pinballed between whatever life throws at me, extra hours to make up for my slowed performance at work, then long nights to make up for how behind I am in classes. I would go to class but not understand anything because I was sleep deprived and behind. I wouldn't go to office hours for help because I had to work longer. Then I would take absurdly long to do my homework or study for exams, because I don't know anything, and that would leave me even more sleep deprived and behind. My grades are okay, but I'd say I'm several weeks behind.

"MFA admit having issues swallowing the bitter financial aid pill I was offered.feel stuck between a rock and a hard place. So. American student here. After two application cycles of nothing but rejections, I was finally accepted in December to a lovely two year MFA in Design program in New Zealand (Massey University in Wellington). It seems like a good fit, I had attended an open day for the uni while there on a research trip a few years ago, the coordinator I talked to was nice/informative (and this school seems to have a fair amount of American expats working there.) After I finish my degree, I would qualify for a 3 year work visa in NZ. But even if I wanted to come back home, the coursework is both accredited in New Zealand as well as with the national accreditation authority for art/design schools in the US (NASAD). I've wanted to expand my toolset into teaching in my field at the higher education level for some time now (or even the secondary level - as my state prefers its teachers to have MAs.). Skip forward some weeks, after the holidays, and I open my award letter from the university. No guaranteed financial aid beyond US federal loans for 23k in tuition and 18k in estimated living costs (per year, two year program.) One tiny scholarship I \*might\* get (6k NZD), but half of it is required to be used to attend a research lab in Sydney. I don't come from a rich family, so, suddenly I have a very difficult decision to make, and not much time to do it in as the program starts in mid Feb. I've already signed all the acceptance paperwork/completed my MPNs, but.the sheer amount of that much debt is still nagging at me really, really badly. I still have 60k in loans from my undergrad that I've been unable to pay on beyond watching IBR stack interest onto the balance, ever since I graduated with a BFA in 2011. My savings is very small for this move, meaning I'll be moving with not much but a couple of suitcases and leaving the rest of my belongings with my parent in the US (including my poor cat who I only just adopted a month before finding out I was accepted). Beyond paying on some last bits of credit cards, my financial life has come to a complete standstill over this to try and stockpile as much money, including I've not been eating well, and not paying attention to taking care of my health ($$$ to see the dentist/doctor? nope). I should be excited about this, but now, I really am not all that excited anymore. More like I've been losing sleep and have a constant headache over the issue. (the constant headache may also be the stress spiking my blood pressure/blood glucose levels through the roof). I'm considering asking for a deferral, as it would mean I'd possibly get more money to move with (my job is moving locations in July though, so I may be out of work before next year rolls around), but that's about the only clear positive benefit. The only other scheme I know that would not be reliant on this school's budget would be a Fulbright, but that's not a sure shot either, especially since in the US, my social network wants nothing to do with my wishes to go to grad school aside from shrugging their shoulders and making me remember that I live in a conservative city where design has never been appreciated or funded well, and my job has no intention to let me pursue grad school while I'm employed there, either. Sorry if this is a bit wordy, but, like the title says.I feel stuck between a rock and a hard pace with this. **tl;dr: US student with not much money offered admission into a MFA program that offered not much in financial aid, yet my career prospects also continue to be awful with just a BFA.

"Thoughts on UK Applications. I'm canadian and at a high school where many students (like a quarter of each year) have gone to the US every year with maybe 2-4 people going to a UK school (and like &lt;8 filling out the ucas) However, given recent events my (junior) class looks to be applying to the UK a lot more next year, around 25 people are already starting to work towards filling out their ucas, so I'm just curious what other people think about the UK application system Here's what it's like (from my understanding don't take my word for anything) You fill out a big common application that only lets you apply to 5 universities max, and only 1 of oxford and Cambridge - not both. Depending on your major you have to take a specialized entrance exam like the ESAT (Engineering &amp; Sciences) or UCAT (something else idfk). They don't consider EC's so they just look at test scores and grades, and they value your ap test scores. It's pretty clearly spelled out as in, you have these scores, you're probably getting in given you write a good personal statement and such. And then for most good schools most acceptances are conditional and require getting 5s on some of your APs (like for ece it'll be that I need 5s in calc bc mech and e&amp;m) they have some pretty good schools too, Cambridge oxford and imperial are obviously great, and then UCL edinburgh and manchester tend to be underrated quite a bit on American college rankings. a lot of the top schools in the UK are obviously not cheap for internationals, but still cheaper than some top schools in the us for an international Idk, if anyone has any more knowledge on UK applications than me let me know what things I got wrong.

"changing uni course. I’m enjoying my current course but I can’t help but feel like another one would be better. I’m about halfway through the first year and we have placement soon. I’m on a teacher training course and 98% of students get a job right after they leave. This might change because of covid but I won’t be leaving until 2023 so hopefully things will be better by then. The thing is I really like the sound of the creative writing course. The modules sound amazing and I could go into screenplay writing which is exactly what I want to do. Part of me wants to change course to this, but I don’t want to leave uni ans not have a job that uses my degree. I never considered other courses when I was applying last year because I made the decision to go to university very last minute, and I chose teacher training because I wanted to do it at the time. It’s not that I don’t want to do it now, I just want to do the creative writing more. Everyone on my current course is so enthusiastic about it and I just don’t feel the same way. I wish I considered other courses and went to other open days but I didn’t and can’t now because of covid. I just feel like I rushed into this course and now I’m regretting that decision. Would I be able to change course? Would I have to finish this year if my current course and then start the new one in September? Or would I just leave until September? Any advice?

"I need help choosing my college. I've been looking at my three big options for the past couple of hours, and I still don't know where I want to commit to. My options are JHU, Cornell, and NU for Pre-Med/CS. &amp;#x200B; Johns is the premier medical school, but because so many people are there just to study, I don't think I can actually enjoy my college years. I just spent 4 years of my life unable to do much of anything due to overbearing parents, and I want to be able to go to parties/clubs while studying. The college looks great and all, and the research is a huge plus. Also, my brother is going to commit there, so that's always a plus. Cornell. Ivy Name is nothing to scoff at, and it's not as cutthroat as Hopkins. I think I would actually have fun there. However, the high suicide rate concerns me, and I read it had a huge party scene which also is an issue, I want a healthy balance of the two. Also, the college is apparently in a rural part of New York, so there aren't many opportunities there. Grade Deflation also seems bad, but med school probably will consider that. Northwestern. Honestly, I don't know anything about this school. I actually just learned about it when I was applying due to their email, and I wouldn't have applied there otherwise. Apparently it's pretty fun there, but the Pre-Med classes are extremely difficult? My cousin is also at UChicago, so I can always go visit him. :) I kind of like the intimacy of Johns classes, but honestly all these schools get into smaller class sizes after the introductory classes. They all seem like beautiful campuses, and as I'm someone who will go for walks, my only complaint would be Chicago weather (doesn't seem that bad though). For financials. they all are pretty expensive, but alas, that's the issue with being in the middle part of the financial spectrum.

"a bit of a roomate conflict/issue going on wondering if anyone had any tips to help (night owl vs normal schedule). Its nothing too serious so don't worry, but currently there is a bit of a lifestyle difference thats making life for me and my roomate a bit tricky. We live in a hotel style 2 person dorm room so we are in relatively close quarters. I am very much a night owl, and I like to stay up really late either studying or playing games or whatever be it. However my roomate goes to bed a little earlier than I do and we've recently come to a bit of an issue. When I am using my computer at night and stuff he says the clicks of my mouse or the light from my monitor or the sound of my keyboard will keep him up or make it harder for him to sleep. I am super sympathetic for him and I don't want to be an asshole about it obviously so I try and move myself to the library or just stay up on my phone instead but lately its been getting kinda difficult. Being at the library and not in my own residence at like 4 am is a bit annoying and it kinda puts a damper on my whole day. Obviously I get that he also is affected by me being up super late/early and I am trying to find a way where we can both be content. I am looking for maybe a solution that means we can both keep our way of life like something for my monitor or a room formatting thing idk. Obviously if it comes down to it he is in the right, i shouldn't expect him to change his regular way of life for my non-standard way of living. But I also feel like I should have some ground or some way to live my own life without having to uproot myself every night to the library or some other common space. Its a bit of a tricky situation, and as simple as ""just fix your sleep schedule bro"" is I don't really see it panning out. This is just kinda how I've done it for a good portion of my life and its been working out well until now. This wont be an issue come next year when I get my own place but still looking for some remedies for the immediate future.

"Junior in a engineering program and doing horrible in my classes. I came in with a 3.0, this was because before freshman year I wanted to take a break and use the summer to do stuff and experience life as I was kinda a neet in HS. My single mother didn’t let me go out much, I felt suffocated a lot and she would make me feel guilty for doing things. I also wanted to take a gap year. She coerced me into doing preemptive summer classes to get a start when I voiced not doing that and just preparing for college mentally and emotionally. Of course I came to college during the summer and drinked, partied and whatever else…my classes went bad and I landed a 3.0 coming into my first semester. Semester after semester I have the same problems.not understanding being a student is my job, I did not the best I could do. Too many nights doing fuck all in my dorm. Eventually I wanted to do ROTC but my mom steered me away form that now I’m a junior. I am in the same boat.this year went horribly especially right now. I’m pretty sure I’m failing my classes this semester and my GPA is somewhere around a 2.7-8 after this idk where it’s gonna drop too. I joined a frat-a new one so it’s very starter company, no hazing- I joined the ROTC program which I’m loving so far but I feel like I’m about to lose it now because of my shit grades. The frat fixed my FOMO of being social to make up my lost HS experiences, the ROTC is generally very motivating for me. But I wish I did both earlier because as a person I felt I grew so much from both these experiences the fear and ROTC. Summer is coming up where I plan to NOT waste a single day and prepare for my next senior year, maybe even take an extra year to fix my GPA? I don’t know, but I don’t want to say it’s my mom’s fault but at the same time I feel I picked up this shit personality from growing up in that household. And now I’m 20, it’s like I can’t blame anyone but me. There’s other shit too that has happened, during my sophomore year I met a girl who tbh become the LOML but we had a rocky relationship because it was a secret cuz she was my boss in a scholarship program we were in so we couldn’t be public and she went abroad for a semester. Instead of being supportive my mom was in my hear of how I’m young and should experience life, she’s playing me and other stuff.hindsight respectfully idk why I let a divorced single mother tell me about love but we broke up and this really hurt me at all levels for a bit. I even went abroad during the summer to see thing from her eyes and get closure for myself which I was able to get some.

Is my professor being unreasonable. My professor has a very strict attendance policy. If you are not in the classroom at the start of class you can not enter. This also goes for exams. You will get a zero if you are late. The door locks at the start of class. People that were late for exams were not allowed to enter. Last week we had an exam. It's at a satellite campus that I had to drive to. On the way there another car hit me. I texted a classmate and told them what happened and she talked to the professor. I get a text back telling me to just go to the classroom. Accident I'd handled I get to class ten minutes late and take the exam. Today I get an e-mail from the professor that says she's sorry I had trouble getting to class but because I was late I'm still getting a zero.

"Is my professor bad or is it just me. In taking an entry level history class to fulfill one of my general education requirements and my professor isn't doing anything. Half the time we never have class (class meets twice a week) and the times we do have class he is usually 10 to q5 minutes late (class is only 1hr 15 minutes). Also time and time again we do not even cover the material, he just starts talking and gets himself off topic and we spend 85 percent of the class on that instead of the material. On his syblus he has the assigned readings for the entire semester and each day there are maybe 5 to 7 different readings (which isn't that big of a deal in regaurds to work) but maybe only once has those readings been touched upon on class. He initially had 4 assignments and a paper that would calculate our final grade (all take home, nothing in class). He then cancled two of the assignments so our final grade is two assignments amd a paper. The paper is due a week from today and everyone in the class has no clue what it is on (part of the readings) becuase we have literally done nothing in that class. He hasn't discussed any of the topics about the paper or the readings so sometimes it is hard to understand exactly what the text says and means to use for our paper.

"“Support” and “Foundation” Classes Required Alongside Math. Hey all. I had a quick question that I could not find discussed at all online. I go to a community college in CA and have recently started my math requirements. This last math class I took had a required “support” class on a whole other day that I was required to enroll in with the class I wanted to take. I figured it was just a class to go to if we needed help, like an office hour. Nope, it was another day of class, making it a 4 day a week class. The professor told us she couldn’t get through all of the required material with only 3 days. Now I am looking to take the next level, and now have to enroll in a Foundations of Math and Support Math class along with my actual math schedule. Instead of these classes adding a day to a 2 day a week class, they add an hour to 2 two hour classes. Making it two three hour classes instead. Is this the standard or am I losing my mind? I don’t mind doing the time to get my degree but why don’t they just say its a 3 hour class up front?",Faculty,Low,0.0,web:reddit:r/college:new,Low,0,1046,210,6,“Support” and “Foundation” Classes Required Alongside Math.,0

"Where can I get the best online MBA assignment services in Australia. MBA students in Australia often search for reliable online assignment services because managing case studies, research tasks and professional commitments at the same time can be challenging. Real discussions on Google and Reddit show that students want academic support that understands business analysis, strategic thinking and Australian university standards rather than generic writing. Many students report problems with low-quality services delivering duplicated or shallow content and with Google’s evolving algorithm now rewarding helpful and original content, trustworthy platforms focused on research depth are gaining more attention. Reddit conversations also highlight how user-generated spam and heavy competition make it difficult to identify reliable services, so students rely more on consistent community feedback. One platform frequently mentioned for plagiarism-free MBA assignments and structured academic support is [https://writeessaytoday.com/](https://writeessaytoday.com/), where users value business-focused expertise and timely delivery.

"This is an automated service intended to preserve the original text of the post. *Hey everyone, TL;DR at the bottom This post is a bit outside of the ordinary since I'm not an undergrad. Rather, I'm a neurodivergent (ASD level 1, ADHD-I, dysgraphia, 3rd percentile processing speed) and severely mentally ill (MDD - Moderate - Recurrent, Generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder. I also got PTSD from my PhD program, but the other disorders I've had since my teens) PhD student who has always been outside the standard deviation on predicted academic metrics a ton. What I mean is that I had a ton of predictors in K-12 for college success, but those never came to fruition at all. During undergraduate, I got thrashed academically at the ""stoner school"" of northern Ohio (they gave me near full tuition) despite a 29 ACT (I got a 24 on it without any prep. Notably, my math score was always low at the 22-24 range, even after I got help. It was to the point my flagship university said I would've had to do remedial math with them when I bombed a placement test. This is one academic anomaly among many I've had over the years), 26 dual enrolled credits with a 3.75 GPA, and a 3.71 high school GPA. I was also accepted to Case Western, but I never went because my family couldn't afford it. I personally think the reason is because I fell on the ""wrong side of the achievement gap"" with the high school I attended because they had no foreign language, AP, IB, or honors courses since they were a high school meant to accommodate those with diagnosed disabilities. I was in the Honors College at my undergraduate of choice and dropped out before they were set to kick me out anyway since I had a 2.9 GPA after my first two years. I also read that those with 29 ACTs across majors usually hover around a little over a 3.0 GPA their first year (like 3.1) on the lowest quartile. However, I had a 2.6 GPA after my first year. They even said they wanted me to talk to them about my situation before making any decision but I was so anxious that I went and dropped before meeting with anyone anyway. Notably, I didn't take a high school accommodation with me to college that would've let me had peer notes and/or notes from the lecturer themselves for my dysgraphia, which I regret in hindsight. Other than that, I had 1.5x extended time, typing instead of writing on exams, and quiet room. I reviewed their latest Honors College data and 90% of students stay above a 3.0 GPA. I was one of 10% who didn't at all. My parents hired a life coach to help me my first year of undergrad (who I didn't do a good job listening to my first year). Second year comes around and I listen to him more and actually do better thanks to the help of someone extra we hired to be ""boots on the ground"" and monitor my study habits (we only had that extra help for one semester though). My parents kept him for all four years of my undergrad. I should note that I did all of my work independently and its not like the coach ever went out of their way to do my homework for me or something like that. Fast forward to graduating and I had a lukewarm senior year (junior year was good albeit I had to withdraw a math course I was set to fail) because I took extremely difficult courses within my major (Psychology) and had a 3.25 overall GPA and a 3.52 major GPA (this includes transfer courses in the GPA calculation). Since I went for a BS instead of a BA as well, I got Cs in foreign language courses and math (other than Calc II when I retook it and got a B. My undergrad didn't do plusses or minuses). I wanted to do a Ph.D, but I got rejected from everyone my first application cycle because I had no clue what I was doing at all. Fast forward to my gap year and two coaches were hired to help me with my GRE and the graduate school application process. They helped me with emails, how to prep for interviews, and more related to the communication and professional pieces of the graduate school application process. I get admitted into 6/8 Master's program and my committee for the program I chose almost didn't let me graduate at all. I also ended up with a bad graduate GPA (3.48) due to a C+ that I got in a core course (this would be failing in grad school or meant I am up for remediation normally but my program counted it) and a B and B+ in two seminar classes because I got C-s on presentations (in what should be ""easy A"" classes). Fortunately, I did graduate with a thesis. I even re-consulted the coach and they helped me with Ph.D applications too. My first Ph.D advisor drops me my second year in the program because I lacked collateral skills to be a successful Ph.D in her eyes. Fortunately, I pass my qualifiers under her (for those who don't know, if someone doesn't pass qualifiers twice in a Ph.D program, its the end of the road). All research projects I worked on with her also got dropped completely (look up why publications are gold in the academic world for context). It's worth noting I didn't continue projects with my Master's advisor since he would reply to my emails irregularly and/or ghost me in the process. Fortunately, my current advisor took me and he wants me to graduate by May 2025, but I'm going to be dropping my PhD program since that data is relative (see my latest post on the PhD subreddit if you want more info). Data collection is done so all I had to do is write up the Results and Discussion sections, but it's severely out of reach. Furthermore, everyone who's worked with me told me that I'm good at doing things, but I need to be explicitly told what to do. This all checks out with my neurodivergence evaluations as my abstract reasoning and verbal fluency scores were consistently low. I also studied a lot with my cohort during graduate school back when I was still doing classes and they kept me on constant track. Here's a statement that was the biggest reality check from a professor who left a comment online, ""To be blunt, you do not seem to have the qualities that I would associate with getting a PhD and working independently. Your grades, lack of direction and the need to use your parents and life coaches all suggest that you are not likely to do well in any career that requires a self-starter who can work independently."" TL;DR - I'm someone who has consistently fallen outside the standard deviation when it has come to academics constantly. I'm neurodivergent (ASD level 1, ADHD-I, dysgraphia, 3rd percentile processing speed) and severely mentally ill (MDD - Moderate - Recurrent, Generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder. I also got PTSD from my PhD program, but the other disorders I've had since my teens) 29 ACT, 3.71 unweighted GPA (no AP, IB, honors, and foreign language courses), 3.75 college GPA with 26 credit hours at the time I graduated high school. Despite this, graduated with a 3.25 overall undergraduate GPA, 3.52 major GPA, and needed life coach support for all four years of undergrad. This support continued with my Master's and PhD program applications. I finished my Master's with a 3.48 overall GPA (with a C+ in a core course) and a Master's thesis thanks to the support of my cohort studying with each other often. I got a 3.9 something GPA in my PhD (as long as it's above a 3.0 it doesn't matter at the PhD level really) and a fellowship (which I'm forfeiting soon as well) and continued working with colleagues my first year of my PhD as well (just less often than my Master's). The main insults to injury are the following: 1.) I got into my ""stoner college"" undergrad's Honors College with a near full tuition scholarship. Current data shows 90% of their students remain above a 3.0 GPA their first year to stay in it. I was one of the 10% who didn't at all. 2.) My ACT score's lowest quartile GPA was around 3.1-3.2, while the other quartiles were around the 3.4-3.6 range. I had a 2.9 after my first two years. 3.) I didn't enroll in one of my state's flagship colleges (Ohio State) since they had me take a math placement test and I was put into the lowest level of math despite a math ACT score of 22 at the lowest (this improved up to a 24 at the highest at one point, but my two highest overall ACT scores were 29 at the highest since I took the ACT three times). I know there is some law in Ohio where students don't have to take remedial math, but this was a mandated thing at the time for upcoming students. 4.) I was dropped by my first PhD advisor for not having collateral skills expected of someone who enters a PhD program among other reasons (i.e., a misunderstanding I won't detail here). I've been rated severely low whenever I've given lectures and/or taught (like 1.4-1.8 out of 5 or high 1s out of 4), and never exactly ""failed upwards."" Here's a statement that was the biggest reality check from a professor who left a comment online, ""To be blunt, you do not seem to have the qualities that I would associate with getting a PhD and working independently.

"Thank you for this comment, let me clarify the points you have raised. She was brought to the team because the teams weren’t created by us, they were randomized. Two people on our team know no English at all and one of them is her. Not only that, but the others barely know English too, and they all had the chance to participate during the interviews by practicing questions beforehand. A did not do such thing, and was absolutely detached from everything from the start, to the point where she was more interested in drawing flowers on her notebook instead of even acting like she was interested. The balue she adds is, well, this isn’t a value based team because it’s randomized, so I don’t see any special value she’s adding. Secondly, all interview times given to us were allocated by interviewees themselves, we didn’t choose anything. They were so eager to talk that some of them talked to us for three whole hours, because this particular topic is not a popular subject of research. When your interviewee wants to talk, and while they’re actively talking, would you cut their speech in half saying that you don’t wanna work on a long interview? I don’t think that any professional would do that. Thirdly, we rehearsed with our advisors and fellow classmates before going in and the rehearsal was harder than the interviews, so no, we didn’t go in with empty hands and no thoughts. This reply might seem like me trying to convince you to believe me, but it just really is making reality more clear. I’m upset because I tried to be as professional as possible, and I have experience working in high stakes environments with hundreds of people where time and people management is key, but my days were filled with compliments from my managers and not a single complaint. However, in those teams I had people who were eager to do their best, not someone who didn’t wanna be there and sabotaged the well-being of the project for being lazy.

"Comprehensive Exam - Need Advice. I am going to start this post off with a rant - my advisor completely screwed me over the course of two years and now I sit here, staring at a blank word doc, completely unprepared. He has been absent since day one and has consistently ignored me until the department head essentially had to yell at him for neglecting me. I was supposed to sit for my exam back in April but that got pushed to sometime this summer because he didn't advise me and I made a small error while picking courses. After ghosting me essentially all of the spring semester, he comes out of the woodwork the first week of May to talk about this summer and preparation for my exam. He gave me four books to read (in comparison, others in my cohort read 60+ in preparation), we met two times to go over them. This past Monday, we were supposed to go over the last book but instead, he ghosted me - claimed he was in the (virtual) meeting room but I was there for over a half-hour and he never appeared. Emails me about an hour after our scheduled meeting with my exam questions and tells me it's due Sunday. I'm floored. First of all, this is the first time I've ever heard of a date for the exam, I honestly thought we had a few more weeks of discussion and I was going to do this thing at the end of July. Nope. It's now. And I am so insanely unprepared. I literally don't even know how to format this thing. It's day three and I have a few jumbled sentences. The other two people in my cohort spent the past two years (with a different advisor) preparing for their exams with clear expectations. Clear booklists by the end of the first semester with a handful of questions that could potentially be on the exam so they could adequately prepare. I'm supposed to start a Ph.D. program in the fall but I just feel so unmotivated and extremely defeated. My advisor at my new university is so amazing and has been checking on me all summer, asking me how my preparation is going. She has shown more concern for me in the few months we've been interacting than my current advisor has mustered in the past two years.

"A Nightmare Journey: My Shattered PhD Dreams in the U.S. In July of last year, I eagerly applied for a PhD program and embarked on my journey to the U.S. in September, filled with high hopes. However, this path has been nothing but torment and disappointment. I encountered a professor who made my PhD experience feel like a nightmare. In our lab, we were divided into two research directions: one that my senior colleague and I were responsible for, and another led by an American student and a Chinese male student. From the moment the four of us entered the lab, my nightmare began. The professor, who is Chinese, held two group meetings each week. For my senior colleague and me, these meetings were sheer mental torture. He would endlessly berate us — each meeting lasting an excruciating four hours, meaning we had to endure eight hours of mental assault every week. None of this ever happened to the American student or the Chinese male student. Our research progress wasn’t slow; we were actually moving faster than their team. But somehow, we became the professor’s targets for venting his frustrations. He never directly answered our questions, always telling us to “look it up in the literature.” We exhausted ourselves digging through countless papers, but still couldn’t find solutions. When we tried to ask him again, he would respond with utter contempt. On top of that, he would criticize our clothing with mocking comments, yet never once said a word to the American student or the Chinese male about their appearance. The lab didn’t have a fixed working schedule, and the professor had said that as long as the work was done, there was no need to keep regular hours. So, my senior colleague and I usually started our day around 9:00 or 9:30. But one day, after a particularly draining experiment the previous day, we arrived at 10:00, only to be met with a torrent of abuse. Meanwhile, the American student arrived at 11:00, and the professor acted as if nothing was amiss. Our research direction requires us to fabricate devices in the cleanroom. In other groups, producing ten devices a month is already considered a lot, yet we are expected to make fifty devices in a single day. To keep up with this pace, we work tirelessly in the cleanroom from morning till night, barely having time to eat. This exhausting routine has lasted for over six months, and my senior colleague and I are on the verge of breaking down. What makes it even worse is the constant personal attacks from our professor. He calls us trash, says we’re useless, and even claims that a few undergraduates could outperform us. These insults are never directed at the American student or the other Chinese male, even though their progress is painfully slow. I feel helpless and anxious, even struggling with insomnia, often dreaming about the professor shouting at me. I now rely on melatonin just to get some sleep. Once, I mustered the courage to speak to the professor. I cautiously expressed my anxiety and distress, pleading with him to treat us a bit more kindly. But he coldly replied, “This is exactly how you should feel.” The mental torment felt endless. My physical health also started to deteriorate; I had debilitating menstrual pain that left me bedridden, yet I still forced myself to work. Even at 11 p.m., I would receive WeChat messages from the professor, filled with scolding and more tasks to complete. The most heart-wrenching incident happened when my senior colleague and I both fell ill with high fevers and were unable to go to the lab.

"Unsure how to go about AI accusing. Hi, I'm a TA for an upper-level social science class, and I'm basically in charge of looking over some of the student's papers before they turn them in for finals to give them feedback and stuff. One of the students, I'll call him Bob, turned in part of his essay draft to me. I read it over, and it was pretty good, but I began to get suspicious at one specific paragraph, which seemed kind of AI-y to me. I'm not an expert on this sort of thing, so I ran it through multiple AI checkers, and it came back 0% AI on all. But I swear, the way the paragraph was written was so much of a red flag. A sentence that felt especially artificial intelligence-y was this one, which was super run-on like: ""Notably, she expresses to the audience as well as her parents that she did not have any issues with abuse, that she did not enjoy the experience of being in an altered state of consciousness, and that she had no plans to ever do it again, however, she ultimately took on a defiant tone in her discussion with her parents, who were quite strict, and thus they believed she needed serious intervention."" I don't really know what to do, if I should bring this up to the professor? I don't have any backing aside from the writing just feels weird.

"Receiving Gifts From Successful PhD Students. I have occasionally received gifts from students who I've supervised. Mostly sentimental stuff. One is a wafer that a student etched with a *microscopic* stick figure of me saying ""The worst outcome is you die, I die, we all die"" - which is something I am known for when telling students to try something new. Another was the abandoned nest of a Montezuma oropendola which I proudly hung from my ceiling until H&amp;S made me take it down. Occasionally, I'll get a bottle of scotch or similar. Nothing that would suggest I am being bought off. A colleague recently came to me to ask about a fountain pen he received as a gift. As my colleagues know that I like fountain pens, he came to ask me if it was as valuable as Google seemed to think it was. Shortly after graduation, a now former student gave him a very expensive (likely worth about $3,000) Japanese fountain pen. Neither of us could find a policy that applied to professors. The only policy we could find discussed gifts to the University itself. I suggested he reach out to HR for more guidance. My wife is a doctor, and her ethics allow her to accept gifts of token value where refusal might cause offense, but there's no way she would accept a gift like that. What say you all?

"My University embraces the responsible use of AI. Will it destory STEM education at my university. I am a tenure-track assistant professor at a non-US research-intensive university. I am mainly evaluated on my research impact. I saw teaching an undergraduate course as a way of motivating the students to master technically challenging concepts, as well as identifying keen students who might be interested in doing research. **I have thus taken on more teaching responsibilities than what is required of me, but I am starting to regret it.** **My university does not ban the use of AI for students.** When ChatGPT first came out, the Provost intially banned it but he quickly backtracked due to complaints from the students and some faculty members. Last semester was when I first notice our undergraduate students use AI on the assignments. I was wondering why the students were getting the same question wrong and made the same mistakes. I fed my assignment into a LLM and knew why. I felt really silly for putting more effort grading the assignments than the students put into doing my assignments. **This semester, I am teaching a course on introductory statistics.** This was a new course created especially for students in our undergraduate program, because our students took the introductory statistics course from the department of statistics and more than half failed the course. I looked at the teaching material from the other statistics course, and I saw that the material was really high quality. The lecture notes were immaculuate and the assignments were well designed and assessed foundamental skills. If this course was available when I was a undergrad, I would have taken it. However, the students hated the course, bemoaned about the workload. and **the students even filed a complaint letter with the Dean regarding the instructor for this course.** So, for my new replacment course for introductory statistics, I added more programming component but kept the mathematical derivation component. I also reduced the weighting of the exam. As I catch up on my assignment marking, **I am just starting to realize how pervasive the use of AI has become at the undergraduate level at our university**. In class, I had repeatedly discouraged students to use AI on the assignments, and I encouraged them to use AI for revising English and providing second opinions. I fed my assignment into a popular LLM and discussed why the outputs are bad. Some of the students (who did attend my lectures) submitted the very same code that I had pointed out was bad. Two students submited the exact same AI-generated buggy code. When I finish going through the assignments, I am sure that I will identify many other duplicate submissions from other students. I will have to hand out a lot of zeros. One of the students was pretty keen and asked lots of questions (relatively speaking). I had also created an online multiple choice quiz question in which I used AI-geneated answers in the available options. Only one student got this quiz question right. Most students selected the option that matched the AI-generated answer, *even though I had walked through the mathematical derivation step-by-step in class for this very problem in class a few days before the quiz*. It's really now difficult to design good math and programming questions that are appropriate for the undergraduate level but that AI cannot solve. The students don't want to grind through basic problem sets to develop foundamental mathematical and programming skills. The students use AI to solve these problem sets. When I create more challenging real-world assignment problems, students become confused because they never learned the fundamental skills from the basic problem sets, and they just give me AI-generated nonsense to grade. **So, in the era of AI at a university that does not ban the use of AI for students, how can I motivate the students to go through the pain of solving technical challenging math and programming questions?** Many, many years ago, I took Geoffrey Hinton's undergraduate course on neural network. As far as I can tell, he used this course as a way of identifying keen students, and he holds office hours to engage with them. His course was actually fairly easy. We were expected to master the technical details. The assignments consisted of playing with pre-implemented machine learning models and seeing how they behave in response to tuning parameter and training parameter changes. The exams only tested superficial high-level knowledge of machine learning. My favourite undergraduate course, however, was on algorithm and design. This was the most challenging course that I have ever taken. (I was a biology major.) I actually failed the first mid-term exam, but got an A- in the course in the end. I loved the challenging assignments, and I had to work with other students on them and attend office hours to even have a chance at solving the problems. If these two courses were taught today, the assignments in these two courses would be ineffective, since the students would just AI. The instructors would have had to go out of their way to make the assignments difficult for AI to solve, which would likely make the assignments too difficult for keen students who do not rely on AI. I know that prompt injection can work, at least until the students realize what's happening. My colleague used this technique on his quiz question in the same course, and the vast majority of our students failed his question. The students simply didn't bother to read the prompt that they copied and pasted, *even though my colleague explicitly warned them about reading the pasted prompt carefully in class*. **My colleague and I are now pretty sure that most of the students will fail the exam.** I had warn the students that I won't curve the grades, but I am guessing that this warning will do about as much good as telling a 5-pack-a-day smoker about the health risks of smoking",Academic,Medium,1.0,web:pullpush:r/Professors:submission:complaint,Medium,2,5979,995,0,My University embraces the responsible use of AI.,0

"Dealing with problematic teacher (PLEASE READ I AM DESPERATE). Here’s the deal: I’m a full honours student, I’m good in class, I behave and I do homework and I get good grades. This semester I had honours chemistry with a teacher who is known to be bad. I had him for a previous science course and was able to get my grades from online resources and doing extra homework, it was too bad. But this year I’ve absolutely lost my control. I have done everything, such as going in early, taking notes before the lesson, doing online research, and reading the entire textbook. The material is simply too hard to understand without someone explaining it. My teacher is horrible at explaining. We are constantly confused as to if something is an example or a lesson. We don’t know what is what because he is teaching as if he’s explaining an example to someone who already knows how to do it if that makes sense. Basically just saying what happens but not elaborating on why or how. He is also routinely absent in the morning when all teachers are supposed to be available for tutoring. I’ve reached out to over a third of the class. Every single one passionately agrees that he’s awful. As students we are hesitant to ask questions because of how degrading his answers are; he makes us feel stupid. I’ve personally put my pride aside on several occasions and his answers just aren’t helpful. I thought I was just had a chemistry for a while and was very upset to think there was something a couldn’t learn. I prioritize school and I got very low grades on the past 2 exams as did the rest of the class. Then someone from the other honours chemistry class sent me their teachers review before the final and it was like an epiphany. I’m not exaggerating when I say I cried because I understood chemistry and I loved it again like when I was first exposed to it. Everything made sense. Everyone in my class read that review and did nothing of our teachers to study and it helped a lot. There’s only 2 honours chemistry classes next semester and I’m with the same awful teacher. He’s been with the school for 14 years. Everyone passionately agrees he is terrible. The teacher once commented he was shocked how many people are dropping out of his class. Here’s my problem: I need to take honours chemistry this year to fulfill the program I’m in. Otherwise I would lose a certificate when I graduate The other class has a 45 person waitlist to get in I cannot tell you how much of a teacher problem this is and not a student problem. We are a bunch of honour kids, we didn’t suddenly decide to ignore one class. The other class does consistently better, and they get material the practice, and notes. Their semester was also well organized whereas we had to cram and didn’t really get through the last two units. If you have any concern that the students need to change let me know why and I’ll explain everything I can. I’m so desperate for one of you to give me a solution. I have a meeting on Monday with one of the heads of the school. I’m going on behalf of over a third of the students in that class who I asked their opinion, again, of which 100% agree we need a solution. Can I ask the faculty to have the other teacher teach both honours chemistry classes? Is it ridiculous? I’m desperate, this class has made me feel terrible about myself, and the past few times I’ve gotten nauseous from being there. My friend also told me she recently gets headaches in and after that class. I think this is as a result of anxiety. For the record, I’ve taken what is considered the hardest class offered at my school. I was bad at it, my grades were lower, I had to work hard, and the teaching style didn’t suit me. But I would never, ever suggest there was a problem with the teacher. He would explain to me, and when I put in effort I was able to succeed. For reference, I am literally spending 3-5x the amount of time and effort in this class, which is easier, and not getting the same results. Again, everything made sense when I read the other teachers review. Also if it helps, he recently docked me every mark on a test question because I didn’t use a molar ratio when it wasn’t required. It was 1:1 and I was cross multiplying, I got the right answer and everything, but he said I got lucky. He also docked me for writing amount instead of volume which I would understand had I not put the unit for volume next the it. For reference this was when labeling a titration graph which I’m 90% sure isn’t dependent on the word ‘volume’ specifically but correct me if I’m wrong If you have any questions at all with my case let me know and I will answer them.

"Is it weird as a 26m to hang out on college campuses I don't attend. Hello all. I'm a 26 year old guy, currently studying 3D animation online. Since all my classes are online only - I've been exploring around various different community colleges around my area; finding good study spots or libraries to get my work done. I hate being cooped up at home all the time (I still live with my parents), and the community colleges around me generally have better hours, more space, and overall better vibes than sitting in a local library or coffee shop all day. I find being in a college environment really helps motivate me and keeps me in a ""college student"" mindset, which I find difficult to achieve in my online classes. It's also been a great source of making friends now and then, I've even met a couple nice ladies at these schools. Now - I'm just wondering if anyone thinks this is odd? At first, I didn't think much of it, as I first started doing this when I was 22. But now, being 26 (my animation program is taking longer than anticiapted), I can't help me feel like I don't belong there or something. am I just overthinking things? I do have bad anxiety. I just don't want students who actually go there to be see me as some creep or loser who just hangs around at a college I don't even attend. Is it strange for me to try and talk to students or befriend them? What about hitting on women? Should I just keep to myself?

"BS in biology wanting to pursue MS in biostatistics. Hi everyone, So for my last cycle, I applied to many schools with MPH and MS in biostatistics and MS for statistics and data science. I didn't have the best of success getting stuck only in MPH programs. I got into MPH with a focus on biostatistics/epidemiology but when I did real in-depth research I found out that pursuing an MPH will make it very difficult to become a biostatistician as you would need 2-3+ years of experience before the transition can occur. As a result I'd rather take a gap year now to figure out my plan of action before accepting the MPH to USC to find better options. Since I really want to be a biostatistician would taking a data analysis boot camp such as those from UC Berkeley extension school or UC Davis extension be any benefit on my application? I feel like this would give me extra benefit in applying showing to the schools that I am serious about pursuing a career down this path. Any advice from you guys that could be beneficial on what I can do to increase/improve my odds of getting accepted for this upcoming cycle? The issue isn't my grades as I do have a 3.636 overall GPA. I did have two data analysis internships, one being at a community hospital and the other apart of my undergraduate biostatistics group at UC Davis. (these are the only statistics focused internships as my other was biology based). Im not sure why I came up short on my applications, it could be due to the fact my GRE score wasn't the best either. Since I took a minor I have completed all the pre-requisites for all of these courses. There aren't any courses that I could take at Community College that could realistically help me significantly to improve my resume as I have completed calc 3, linear algebra, and differential equations.

"An Extremely Unscientific Analysis of Asking Students to do Class Evaluations. I've been teaching a general-education statistics class (~70 students each semester) for 3 years, and the content + structure of the course has been stable for the previous two years. I thought it would be interesting to see how the way I ask students to complete the course evaluations impacts the evaluations. The (incredibly unsound) methodology: * In the 2023-2024 year, as part of their attendance activity for the week, I had students check a box that said ""I pinky promise that I filled out the class evaluation at {$url}"" * In the 2024-2025 year, as part of their attendance activity for the week, I had the students check a box that said ""I have filled out the class evaluation at {$url}"" The 2023-2024 year resulted in an average response rate of 65.7%; the 2024-2025 year resulted in an average response rate of 53.6%. [Here's a bar chart of the results by question](https://i.imgur.com/C8xg9rD.png); note that all ratings were on a scale of 1-5. Apparently, having students ""pinky promise"" that they've filled out the evaluation improves my overall evaluations by ~0.2 points; my ability to explain content and the utility of my feedback were the biggest winners with a full 1/3 point jump! For reference, the typical standard error of the mean (after the finite population correction) each year was around 0.07 points. Looking at the raw data, I have about the same number of 1's, 2's, and 3's no matter the year---the number of 4's marginally increased and the number of 5's greatly increased. My hypothesis is that the students who are less likely to violate the sanctity of the pinky promise also tend to be better students and thus have better experiences in the class (yielding higher ratings in the course evaluations). Blah blah lack of temporal randomization, yada yada other disclaimers, this is just for fun so there's no need to complain about how I could've done the experiment better or made a better plot that takes more than 2 minutes in Excel",Attendance,Medium,1.0,web:pullpush:r/Professors:submission:attendance,Medium,1,2050,346,2,An Extremely Unscientific Analysis of Asking Students to do Class Evaluations.,0

"Advice on handling a professor threatening to contact administration on me despite having an outstanding academic track record. Hi reddit, apologies in advance I am new to reddit as a concept and have very little forum experience. Background info: I am currently a student working towards a semi-difficult STEM degree and in my junior year of college. For this, I am currently in an upper level physics course and have gotten good grades on my tests and assignments up until this point. The course is attendance optional and due to the teaching style it has been more worth for me to read and study on my own then attend the early morning lectures, to my knowledge he is aware of this despite the large lecture size. I have good grades in all my courses, and have worked hard despite numerous disabilities to have above a 3.5 GPA in a difficult STEM field. Additional info that can sway your advice: If I had a completely clean record, I would be less concerned but over 2 years ago me and my ex had a pretty massive breakup that resulted in both of us requesting the university to get involved so I have that on my record and It can be used as leverage on my character regardless. However I have drastically increased my grades and mental health since then, have worked on my self drastically and have worked within my field in several internships since. This has not been escalated at any point and at the moment of us filing this we have had no contact besides her stalking my linkedin occasionally. I have gotten As in all my core classes, my GPA went from a lower 2.0+ to a 3.5+ since enrolling and my advisor as well as my core professors alike have commented on my growth as a student my success in the courses I take. Additionally when attempting to review my first exam, I had no issue in doing so. I have been doing better on exams since that first one with this past exam being the outlier. I have considered other reasons for why this has been difficult such as possibly miss-grading my exam and recognizing it after (either mistake or even purposeful at this point), however I haven't mentioned this to anyone and plan to keep an open mind until I see the exam for myself (if that ever happens given its been several weeks trying). There is another person in my lecture with the same first name and similar last name sharing the first 2 letters and same letter count. This person has averaged around what I got on this past test, for me it is an outlier although still possible i messed up. I just want the option to review my mistakes in preparation for the final Clarification: I haven't ever violated anything warranting me in violation with my universities AIV. I have never done anything that merits anything of the sorts, I am surrounded by people who take short cuts and I haven't ever done that throughout my academic journey. I think me even wanting to see an exam I did poorly on demonstrates my integrity as a student. I also am a student with disabilities and have utilized these as needed throughout my academic career. My professor is aware, and I take all my exams in this course in a separate testing center for people with disabilities which is heavily monitored. I leave my phone at the front and am only allowed to go back with what is permitted before being handed my exam. I don't believe this is graded at the testing center but I could be wrong. I have been using all of my allotted time for all of these exams, since this isn't one of my core specialized classes and I take more precaution where im least comfortable. It was a 50 question multiple choice bubble sheet exam and it was also worth 12.5% of my grade. it shouldn't be this hard for me to see it. Main summary of information concerning this: On my most recent exam, I received what I considered to be a bad grade (B- including the extra credit points I earned). I have gotten A's up until this point with the EC, and this time around I got more extra credit points than I usually get (quiz based EC instead of curving grades). I initially thought ""no big deal, I will just show up to office hours and review it"". the syllabus states that I need to give advance notice so I wrote an email just asking to review my exam. After not hearing back for several days, past one of the proposed meeting times, and after I received a response after reaching out to the department about why I may not be getting a response, he basically said ""talk to me after class"". This was on the day of a lecture but I was sleeping in so I did not see it to after, I was also a bit taken back given that the department said he would reply to my previous emails and I didn't get a direct response. Since the syllabus requires advance notice and I made the dates clear to him and one of them had already passed by the time he responded so i followed up with ""I will be at your office hours on Thursday (and the date), see you then"". I got a response from him the next day basically saying that I would not get to review my exam but instead he would be using this as a teachable moment to discuss my behavior. I was floored at the moment to receive this, given that I have responded very nicely to him, and have a good grade in his class compared to my peers. I also at this point felt very uncomfortable and at a loss and I called the department and asked to speak to his boss and forwarded the email chain basically explaining that I am just trying to use office hours to review my exam and that I feel pretty uncomfortable with the response I was given. It has been over a week and despite many back and forth and despite hearing from his boss that I would be able to review my exam I have been told that he is still going to be using it as a teachable moment which seems unfair given the circumstance. Additionally in the follow ups i asked specifically for confirmation that I would not be approached aggressively and that I would just get to look over my exam, to which he outright refused. After talking with my parents they reached out behind my back and basically just said that I was a good student and they just want me to be able to review my exam to which he threatened to contact the office of rights and responsibilities on me and portrayed me as a bad student which is far from the truth. I want to take this up with university but my parents are scared that this will fall back negatively on me, and on top of that think that I just need to show up to the lectures and deal with him directly despite his continued lack of perspective on how a student might feel being subjected to this. They want me to just suck it up and start attending the lectures despite them agreeing that I haven't done anything wrong to warrant this. I have remained professional in my emails and have continued to stand my ground on scheduling my exam review but hearing how he was talking to me to my parents behind my back makes me feel like I will never get a chance to review my exam. I feel a responsibility to take this higher but have received advise that I may be taking on something that I will not be able to handle even with the damning email chains and my professor basically admitting to having preconceived notions about me as a student, lying about my academic standing in his course to my parents, and not letting me review my exam despite me having a good track record in his course (doing well on previous exams, doing all the extra credits, finishing homework early etc). It feels surreal that me trying to just review an exam has lead to this but considering it is an outlier I would like to review it from my own academic growth and I cannot give that up. So I'm asking for some perspectives on the situation and how I should handle it moving forward. Looking forward to hearing from you reddit :). Goal: My goal is graduate as soon as possible and I am trying to avoid even being halted for an investigation even if it is BS to begin with.

I went to the Z library and learned that there were textbooks in this stuff. I googled people in this subfield in my area. I learned that there was a prof in this research niche at a college 40 minutes away from my college. I learned that someone who grew up 60 minutes from me was in this subfield. I downloaded some textbooks off Z library and put them in a folder on my laptop. With them in hand I went to my minor advisor. I told her this field existed and I was very excited. I knew there was an independent study course in the department catalog. I said plz plz, would you let me learn from this textbook as an independent study?

"Wrongfully Dismissed. Hey everyone, I’m in a really tough spot and could use some advice or just a reality check. I was recently dismissed from my MSW program (at EKU) because I failed my field placement. I’m currently drafting my appeal letter, but I’m terrified it won’t work. The Situation: My placement was at an agency serving adults with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (I/DD). A major project was to create a Sexuality Curriculum using PowerPoint slides. The issue wasn't that I couldn't do the work, it’s that my supervisor (""Ms. X"") made it impossible to finish. She created a complete moving target regarding the content: • Week A: She would tell me the slides were too simple and demanded I use ""Professional/Clinical language."" • Week B: I would spend hours rewriting everything to be clinical. She would then fail the assignment, telling me I was being insensitive and that it needed to be ""Plain/Simple language"" for the clients. • Week C: I’d switch it back to plain language. She’d get angry that it wasn't professional enough. It felt like she was gaslighting me. I have emails and texts proving she gave these contradictory instructions, which I am including in my appeal. Where I Messed Up (and I’m admitting this): I’m not claiming I was perfect. The biggest hole in my defense—which I am owning up to in the letter—is that I procrastinated starting this specific assignment. I didn't ask her about the PowerPoint parameters until the internship was nearly over. Because I started late, I didn't have a buffer for her flip-flopping. If I had started month 1, I probably could have involved the school sooner. I also waited way too long to call my Faculty Liaison because I was afraid of looking incompetent. My Appeal Strategy: I’m writing a letter to the Academic Standing Committee. My plan is to: 1. Show the ""Receipts"" (emails/texts) proving she gave mutually exclusive instructions (Do X / Don't do X). 2. Take full accountability for not starting the project sooner and compressing my own timeline. 3. Admit I should have alerted the field office earlier. Has anyone here successfully appealed a field dismissal? Does admitting that I started the project late ruin my chances, or does it show ""insight"" and ""accountability""?

"would this be a good essay topic orrr. So I've been brainstorming ideas for my college essay, and I have a pretty odd one that I think might work. I've always struggled with anxiety, and during the past few years I've had a really hard time dealing with stress etc. Because of this (and some other issues) I lost my period for around a year, and ended up with some really bad medical complications. During then, I felt like I lost a whole part of my identity, and on top of that I wasn't coping well with the stress in my life either. So, in general I want to talk about how I eventually learned to manage stress and how losing my period felt like losing a part of myself. I want to convey how I grew through that experience and became more resilient yk. I'm hoping to major in the field of psychology, and I'm hoping this topic would show my growth and resilience somehow. I know that writing about being ill and mental health is kind of icky with admissions officers, and a lot of people tend to avoid these subjects, but I really think that my topic might help show how I've grown and matured as a student.

I am a TT professor, so scholarship and professional development is part of my review coming this fall (my 3rd year review). When I started my school said that each teacher had access to a pool of funds to pay for conferences for PD. This was completely cut during Covid. They brought it back this year but they will only pay your entry fee if you are a presenter and will not cover any lodging or travel expenses. There was a conference this past weekend that was close enough for me to drive so I decided to go. I would say with gas, entrance fee to 3 days of the conference, two nights in a hotel (I got the cheapest and by nature the sketchiest hotel I could find) I spent maybe $500. I’ll be honest I was incredibly stressed about $$ the whole time. I skipped a networking event because I didn’t want to lose my free street parking and taking an Uber would have cost $30 each way.

"I'm going to do a french exit with my phd program. Over the last 3-6 months, I've posted quite a bit here and on the PhD subreddit. Shoutout to anyone who recognizes me. I promise this will be my last post here. The VERY short TLDR: I'm in my second year of my PhD program. I have a very toxic relationship with my PhD advisor. He's made fun of my body and health conditions, frequently yells at me, compares me to his other students, gave the rest of my funding away to his newest student, genuinely has no respect for me, etc. I I found a new professor to co-advise thinking it would be better--until I found out he is arguably worse than him (the first time I met this man I was heavily insulted and told how useless my degree and research is). Last semester, I went to the dean, program director, ombuds office, and union to help me with my bad advisor. No one could do anything due to the complexity of my situation. Here I am now. Months away from taking my qualifying exam. I spent all winter break reflecting on how my program keeps getting worse for me. I'm not even looking forward to anything. In fact, I dread it. This winter break has been particularly hard on me. Since the beginning of December, I was diagnosed with an ultra rare disease, was hospitalized due to horrible side effects from an antidepressant I was on, found out I have thyroid dysfunction causing premature ovarian failure, and now I have muscular atrophy from a botched surgical procedure. Being in a position with so many health issues my whole life as been hopeless. Nobody understands--friends, family, even my therapist. To have an advisor who puts me down for me and makes comments about my body and health issues makes it so much worse. I spent the last few weeks heavily considering MAID because every day is just too much for me and my body. Most times I doubt if I'm even physically capable of doing the research I'm assigned. At the start of the year, it got to a point where I realized that I was unhappy with a lot of features of my life--but most of them always pointed back to my PhD program. I cannot deal with my chronic health issues on top of being in a toxic environment. The only way I can leave is to drop out altogether. I can't transfer programs or advisors (no one at my university has funding--I emailed so many people), I am not in the position to transfer schools, and I don't have the mental or physical capacity to spend another 4 years in this program and ""tough it out"". When I made posts here in the past, many people were supportive and encouraged me to leave. I was so stupid to not listen, but to be fair, I never had a game plan career-wise up until now. Last month I had a serious conversation with my advisor and told him all I wanted was to be respected by him. I thought it was a productive conversation and for the first time in over a year, he treated me like an actual person. Until I got a snarky email from him today complaining about how I haven't been as communicative over the last few weeks (uhh--yeah I have like three different health issues going on at once and I am genuinely so depressed at the thought of being infertile and having a longer list of health issues? But I can't tell him that because he won't understand. It's not like I completely ignored him.) The email upset me. He is never going to not be toxic to me, or at least long-lasting. I've been passively looking at careers completely irrelevant to my degrees. I've messaged some people in those fields and I think I'm going to do it. I'm finally going to drop out in the next month. I know the right thing to do is to tell my advisor or give him a warning about my plans. But truthfully? I think when the time is right, I am going to quietly return my lab keys to admin and withdraw from the university without a peep. Is that horrible of me to do? Yeah, probably. I just can't stand to be yelled at by this man one more time or criticized when he can't understand my position. And I'm tired of my university failing me and not wanting to help me in the slightest bit. I think I officially exhausted any other options. I've been ghosted by everyone I've reached out to for help because it's gotten to a point where they don't know how to help me. I have too much going on and I'm not interested in having this program make my life worse than it already. I don't even want to use him as a letter of recommendation at this point. I just want to leave. I guess I just want to know if there are any other negative implications of leaving my program without telling anyone? Or if I am genuinely stupid and making a terrible mistake.

"What constitutes academic misconduct and is this worth reporting. TL;DR. Good friend has a mental breakdown a few weeks before project is due. Career advisor insists on keeping good friend's name in the project despite non-contribution and tells the group to use friend's individual submission as group submission. The group refused the career advisor's suggestion and removed good friend's name from the project too. To set context, this was a group project involving 5 individuals (A, B, C, D and me). One of my project mates and close friends, A, had a mental breakdown and was warded into a mental institution a few weeks before the project is due. A has a solid track record in terms of academics and her parents expect her to remain on the dean's list. Introducing 'E', the career and counselling advisor for A and my group. The family members of A reached out to B to inform them of her mental health condition and express wishes to maintain A's GPA for this semester. The group already has issues with dynamics for this project, with C and D not contributing to the project. Both B and I texted in the group chat, asking C and D to contribute and even allocate ""easier"" portions of the project to them. Zero response from them, but based on both of their Instagram stories, they had the time to be out partying and clubbing. At this point, the project was making decent progress with just the efforts of B and I. B and I lamented over leaving out A, C and D's names from the project. Ultimately, we decided to cut out A's name first, and decide if we should cut C and D's names out closer to the submission date. E starts pressuring me first to keep A's name in the project as ""she is still a student of the college"". I refused. While I do sympathize with A's mental health struggles, she did not contribute anything to the group projects. We have modified her workload by leaving her with the easier portions (summary and conclusion) and even visited her house when she told us explicitly she feels better and is ready to do the project with us. I explained that it isn't fair for B and I since we are both trying our hardest to make this project work out. We have already made reasonable concessions taking into account A's declining mental health. E calls me, and I quote, 'cold-hearted b*tch who wants to see her friend fail'. I hung up from conversation. E realized that she is not going to convince me. She approached B, and starts pressuring her. Unfortunately, B cracks and agrees to put A's name into the document. E also starts infodumping A's personal and mental health issues to B. Subsequently, E accuses me of non-contribution to the project to B despite having zero evidence whatsoever. B gives me a heads up by sending me what E accused me of. Introducing 'F', the professor teaching the tutorial slot for the project. Prior to my meetup with Professor F, she is already aware of A's mental health issues by E. I explained to Professor F the entire insanity of this situation. She agreed with me, also saying that it is not fair for the team if A does not contribute and we leave her name in the project. I told B to tell E that we have already sought the advice of Professor F, and she has given us the approval to omit A's name. B informs E. E tells B that A did contribute, and asked B and I to check our school mail for any documents by A. Both B and I did not receive any emails from A. E insisted that A did contribute, and started pressuring B again to leave A's name in the project. It was later revealed that A submitted the project individually. Professor F got the entire group to meet, and hashed out all discrepancies with contribution with C and D, warning them to be more responsive and contribute or else she will get B and I to omit their names during submission. After the meeting, I checked in with Professor F about A's individual submission for the group project. Professor F confirmed with us that A submitted the project individually, and reaffirmed her prior advice to allow our group to remove A's name from the project. When I asked if we could see A's submission to compare similarity, Professor F refused, citing potential plagiarism issues for the group if we unintentionally get influenced by A's content. She later helped us compare A's submission and our draft for the project, and reassured us that the content is completely different from the group's. E sends B a copy of A's submitted assignment. When B asks E how she obtained A's assignment, E said she downloaded it via the submission portal. E then tells B to use A's submitted individual assignment, modify a little, and submit it as a group. B tells me of E's suggestion, and I shut down the idea completely, citing plagiarism and ethics. It is important to note that E is also a professor. However, she is NOT teaching this particular module for this semester. I immediately informed Professor F about E's alarming suggestion and sent her the incriminating screenshots. I also informed Professor F about E's baseless accusation about me 'not contributing' to the project. She then tells me to disregard E's instructions and she will deal with E at a later time. At this point, C and D had contributed to the project albeit to a lesser capacity. I also informed C and D of the situation. We wrote a paragraph as a group informing E that unanimously, we will not pass off A's individual work as group effort. B then sends it to E. E continues to harass B by infodumping more personal details of A until the semester concluded and demanding B to help A, leaving B unnecessarily distressed. After submission, I called E with B to set the record straight: 1. I have contributed to the group project in all stages. I was the person who created the document and provided MY PERSONAL essay outline for the project to speed up the writing process. 2. I informed her that she needs to issue a formal written correction for her false accusation as this kind of accusation is taken very serious in an academic settle. E refused to take accountability for her words, saying that: 1. She added me into a group chat and claimed I did not respond to her texts. Hence, I was ""not contributing"" I told E that if her message was that, she could always drop me a text or email. However, I did not receive a single text or email from her during the alleged week that I was 'added' into the groupchat. B backed up my claim by also helping me visually double confirm that I was not added to any group chats. I checked all of my school communication platforms after the call, there was absolutely ZERO group chats I was added into by E. 2. She refuses to issue any correction because I am 'rude'. For the record, in this call with her, I stuck to only the facts and what she alleged over text. While I might have been firm to get my point across, I'm very sure anyone in my position would have used the same tone to get this very serious message across to an individual who refuses to listen. I tried reasoning with her on why a written correction is an appropriate response. My thought process was: ""If E accused me of non-contribution over text, then if proven untrue, it is only fair she issues a correction over text, the same mode of communication E abused to throw baseless accusations relating to my work ethics."" Of course, that was made by constant interruption from her to the point where B had to forcefully mute E to allow me to finish. Questions: 1. Did E commit academic misconduct by pressuring a student (text trail as evidence is available) to take another individual's work and pass it off as group effort? 2. What recourse do I have against E for her (very clearly and reputation damaging) false accusations? 3. Is E even allowed to reveal private information of a vulnerable individual to an unrelated 3rd party (ie. tutorial mates)? Some considerations: 1. Full-ride, aiming to grad school and above. I am mindful and aware that some educational institutions may try to cover up this incident or even retaliate against me for 'seeking trouble' against a teaching staff member. This is an even bigger motivation to quash E's baseless claim since it also will impact my scholarship if her accusations reach management level. 2. Any grounds to even pursue action since I feel what E had suggested and done falls in the gray area of what could be defined as academic misconduct. [EDIT] 3.

"Desperate. Preface: This is a really big emotional rant. If this isn't compliant with the rules of the sub, please alert me to it. It would be great if I could be redirected to the appropriate sub, if applicable. I would not like to post this in r/math, since that is primarily for informed mathematics discussion, and I am anything but an informed mathematician. Also, if anyone has any paragraph chunk issues, yell at me. I black out during tests. Every test I’ve had. Undergrad through now. In my undergraduate institution, I was able to secure extended time for my exams and my exam grades shot up. Every time I forfeited this option (usually for ego reasons) I ended up with something horrendous that I could hardly recognize and that I didn’t even remember doing. Background: I study math. I struggled with it growing up (I mean, I literally went into college unable to multiply exponents or add fractions or explain what a function on a graph was) and clawed and fought my way through hordes of adults telling me I wasn’t talented enough to become a CS/Math student in undergrad, with mostly As to show for it (after 18 years of Ds.) My undergraduate professors all noticed my inconsistent exam performance, and luckily, one of them was extremely adamant that I get sensory/time accommodations for exams, so I did. I am interested in pursuing graduate Theoretical Computer Science and work full time as a cybersecurity engineer, so I’m going to grad school part time. I have been doing excellent in my abstract algebra course thus far, if you judged me by the proofs I do in my assignments. I’m usually at the top of the class here. I like doing the assignments. I sometimes do harder problems for fun, to test my understanding. I find excuses to use abstract algebra at work. I can't fucking stop bringing up things I learn in class to my coworkers, boyfriend, etc, and inevitably end up teaching them (and myself) the material. But of course, we just had our first exam. I thought I knew everything, and I thought that the professor (who is a somewhat crotchety old guy) would think I was stupid if I requested extended time, so I didn't. I remember a conversation I had with another student prior to the test, and I explained some concepts to him that he found confusing. He remarked I’d probably do well and I shouldn't be anxious. I knew he was wrong. I don't remember taking the test. I don't remember how I got to some of the absolutely absurd conclusions I came to. I don't know why I did anything. I should have been able to do everything, but my brain would not. Fucking. Concentrate. It would loop over stupid things over and over again and mess up basic arithmetic; stuff that should have been second nature by now got thrown out the window in favor of complete gibberish. It was like I was operating in a fourth language, like one half of my brain was inadequately functioning in overdrive and the other half decided to sedate itself. I could not pull myself to attention no matter how much effort I exerted. I still cannot explain this. It took me TWENTY MINUTES to do ONE INVERSE OF A 2X2 FUCKING MATRIX. YOU KNOW. THE EASY ONES FROM UNDERGRADUATE LINEAR ALGEBRA. I kept scribbling over stuff over and over again, panic swelling up and taking up space in my head and clouding my vision over and over again. My professor recently pulled me aside and expressed concern over my exam. I was initially confused, because I studied hard and could do every problem. He said my answers were, to be verbatim, ""incomprehensible."" He asked how I was doing in the program, and I said that I had gotten an A- in a statistics course (the exam was a take-home with an in-class portion. You can guess how I got the minus.) I talked about the in-class portion of that exam and how I could not process one of the questions at all, no matter how I read it, even though it was supposed to be easier than the take-home portion. He wanted to attribute my nonsensical answers to a complete lack of understanding of the (very basic - I'm literally talking just properties of groups and subgroups) material (which I had in undergrad! And did well in! And did on the homework assignments! I cannot stress enough how ANGRY I am about that!). I ended up getting frustrated, throwing my hands up in the air in front of him, muttering in between attempts to suppress the emotion: ""I don't know, I don't know why I did anything. I can't explain it. I'm just really stupid."" I am demoralized. I don't feel like I have any talent for math. I really never did. I do proofs in my spare time because I enjoy them. I work regularly with algebraic structures (finite fields are generally a godsend in my area.) But now all I want to do is drop out. I don't know where to go or where to turn for help. I don't know how to progress knowing that there are students who don't do this, who are more talented and smarter than I am, who would destroy me in any PhD candidacy exam.

"That is a huge amount of debt that would really negatively affect your quality of life in ways you probably don’t understand right now. I am not even sure you could borrow that much without a parent or other guarantor and I’d be reluctant to support that, myself. You’d be sacrificing vacations (and it sounds like international travel may become important to you), eating out, and many other fun activities for years while you pay that back, and you’d probably need to delay things like buying a house or having kids. I wouldn’t take out loans like that for any major/program that didn’t have a 99% probability of leading to a high paid job with a lot of openings. You’d want to be preparing for a job that pays close to $120-$200k a year so you could make a reasonable plan to pay it back before you turn 35. Medical school, nursing, possibly a good CS major fit that. Chemistry probably doesn’t. Maybe chemical engineering but you’d have to really research that. The www.onetonline.org website will tell you about expected demand and pay for every career by state. It’s pretty useful to research careers. See what you come up with for jobs with a chemistry degree. I think you’d be smarter to find a cheaper way to do college, if you are paying yourself. For example, if you work at Starbucks you can do a degree at Arizona State online essentially for free and use your wages to cover you living expenses. UPS also gives about $10k in tuition reimbursement to even part-time employees and that should cover tuition at a community college. Michigan has some excellent public universities you can smoothly transfer into after doing GE and basic prerequisites at a CC. UM is renowned worldwide, MSU is quite good and there a several others that can give you a solid start. You should be looking at the schools you want to transfer into and what they require From the very first class you sign up for. And I think you could go on your local CC website and sign up for an online class starting this month. I know CC is not glamorous like moving to the UK for college but it also won’t ruin your life and you can probably cover most of your living expenses by working and going to school. If your family income isn’t high a Pell grant should go pretty far towards covering CC. And this doesn’t have to mean the end of your relationship. You could work and save up and then either do a formal study abroad in Europe (there are some good scholarships out there for that too but I don’t know much about UK opportunities) or sign up for a semester of online classes and do them from the UK. Your girl could study abroad in the US or maybe try to work here. Shoot getting married would make you independent for financial aid purposes (you’d qualify for Pell grants and other aid regardless of parental income) so her moving to the US and marrying you is probably less insane than taking out $200k in loans to go there. But you are 20 so keep in mind you are both likely to change a lot over the next few years and in-person a long distance relationship can fizzle - especially if money is a constant issue.

"I messed up and I know it's small but I'm annoyed. So I say this in a ""haha well that sucks!"" kind of way but I am lowkey mad at myself for this. My first class/term in grad school, I finished with an 89.8% in Canvas. I didn't expect my professor to round up but obviously hoped he would, and sure enough he reported an A to the university.

As for CalPoly i haven't heard very much from their physics department, most i know is i did reach out to one of their professors a while back to ask about an internship but i was told to reach out once i transfer and they'd be glad to consider me but im not sure if they were just being nice. **Community** at Berkeley would be nonexistent upon arrival, i would have to make new friends, figure out housing, and hopefully land job somehow. I'm a very independent individual and have been living on my own for a couple of years now but it's still a little concerning that i would have to restart again. At CalPoly, because i lived nearby i have like all my closest friends there, guaranteed roommates i know ill get along with, and a good connection to an on campus job, I've also been pretty involved in the campus culture because I was part of the band for a year and got to surround myself with that community alot. Overall I would have a developed support group there. **Financial Aid** is a tricky topic, on my fafsa this year i have to apply as a provisionally independent student, the issue is that the process to verify my situation will take too long, meaning i won't have a financial aid package before the selection deadline. I did contact both schools and they mentioned if i qualify (which is likely) i may receive up to my full cost of attendance, but i can't make my choice based on that assumption. I'd really appreciate any help, if yall have any questions regarding the situation I'll be glad to answer them",Attendance,High,2.0,web:pullpush:r/ApplyingToCollege:submission:attendance,High,2,2299,417,2,CalPoly or Berkeley: This is tearing me apart.,0

"Low GPA (3.32/4) from India — advice on improving MSCS admissions chances. Hi everyone, I’m planning to apply for MSCS programs (Top-15 in the US) and would appreciate some guidance. I’m from a Tier-2 university in India with a GPA of 3.32/4. I’m aware that this is a weak point in my profile for top 15 uni, and I also understand that one year of work experience won’t really offset a low GPA for MSCS FALL 2027. I have around 6 months before I start working, and I want to use this time effectively to improve my chances. I know that high GRE and TOEFL scores alone won’t be enough, so I’m trying to understand what actually matters more for competitive admits. My main doubts are: What carries more weight: research internships with strong LORs or research publications (for example, IEEE conferences) or working on publishing in top conferences? Rank them. If publications matter more, does the conference quality make a big difference? (ieee, springer etc) Are LORs from research mentors (from internships or research projects) valued more than LORs from regular coursework professors? Can strong research experience realistically help compensate for a 3.32 GPA, or is Top-15 still very unlikely? Given my situation, what would be the best way to use these 6 months to strengthen my profile? Also,How should I address my GPA in the SOP so that it doesn’t hurt my application or avoid discussing it unless asked?

"Strategy for Making Friends in College. I really struggle with making friends. I’m on the autism spectrum and have had to really learn from trial and error how to connect with people. I was very lonely in high school, and was determined to have a different experience in college. I feel like I’ve finally started to figure out my own way to make new friends. This advice is for anyone looking for a way to connect with others and build lasting friendships. So if it helps, here’s my highly strategic method of making friends: 1.) I observe the students in my classes/around campus and watch for anyone who strikes me as compatible. For me, this often includes students who share a special interest of mine(maybe they mention Legos, or have a Dungeons and Dragons sticker on their laptop), alternatively dressed individuals, or people who are openly part of the LGBTQ+ or neurodivergent community. I’ve found through experience that I often connect easier with people of these categories, but your own compatible categories will probably look different. 2.) I wait until I have an opportunity to connect with them over something, often through the form of compliments or interest in something they’ve said in class. One girl mentioned a lego sword she was building during her self introduction on the first day of class, one person was dressed in head-to-toe Pokémon merchandise, one girl was just wearing a Hello Kitty jacket. I would wait until after class or during a group activity and (even though my social anxiety tells every cell in my body to run in the opposite direction) I casually approach them and ask a question about the shared interest, or make a conversation opening comment. 3.) If I’m being positively received, and still think based on this first impression that we could be compatible friends, I tell them flat out that I want to be friends, suggest we hang out sometime, or ask for their phone number. And then I follow up by reaching out again to get to know them more and reinforce the idea that I’m interested in their friendship. Not many people pursue friends this directly, and most people are pleasantly surprised and flattered by my interest in them. Think about it, wouldn’t you be delighted if a person in one of your classes noticed you, and actually bothered to tell you that you seem like a cool, interesting person to know? The key point is that every time, this method created an opportunity where I had a subject matter I enjoyed talking about(decreases my nervousness, gives me plenty of things to say) and that is meaningful to them(they’re usually excited to talk about the niche subject, which lowers their social anxiety and fosters connection). I might ask to see a picture of the project they mentioned, compliment their merch and ask where they got it, ask a question about their interest like who their favorite character is/their opinion on it, or— as I’ve gotten more confident in this method of approaching people, sometimes I’ll even just tell them I’m interested but don’t know much about it and directly invite them to info-dump( this method has led to some very enthusiastic and adorable responses), or if I’m feeling especially brave, Ill just come right out and tell them, “Sometimes I just get a weird feeling that I could be friends with a specific person. And I have that feeling about you!” I have yet to ever have this strategy back fire. Because the universal truth is that it’s hard to make friends as an adult, and telling someone in an open, genuine way that I want to be their friend is usually a major compliment and relief to them. They usually respond enthusiastically that they’d love to be friends, and we exchange phone numbers or walk to our next class together. Sometimes the friendship doesn’t lead anywhere, or as we get to know each other we seem less compatible and drift apart. But I’ve also met two of my closest friends using that strategy. I call it the “Kindergarten Strategy”, and I’ve found that outright telling someone I’d like to be friends is the fastest, least confusing way for me to make new friends. A big obstacle for me normally is reading social cues about whether or not someone is just being polite, or actually wants to get to know me. By telling them up front that I want to know them, it then leaves the ball completely in their court about how to respond. If they aren’t really interested, they’re usually still nice, but don’t show any enthusiastic interest. Maybe they end the conversation, don’t respond to texts, or just generally don’t reach out or approach me to talk in class. I accept these as signs that they are not interested, but it’s still a much gentler let-down than being flat out rejected or led on. Instead it often leads to having a pleasant, casual acquaintance in class, which is nice if we ever need to work together on a project. Best case scenario, they respond with enthusiasm, or sometimes even ask if I’m free to hang out that same day! I realize this strategy might sound odd, intimidating, or juvenile, and probably won’t work for everyone. But it has greatly increased my friend circle, and has actually built a lot of my confidence in approaching strangers. The important thing is to be kind and respectful. I want people to feel noticed and included, not harassed or uncomfortable. And I do my best not to take it personally if a potential friendship doesn’t work out. People are complicated and not everyone fits together, but it’s so worth it to find people who truly get you. And it makes college so much more enjoyable when I get to look forward to seeing friends on campus or after class. I’m slightly embarrassed to share such a personal thought process online, but I wanted to share anyway in case there are other neurodivergent or lonely people out there who could benefit from what I’ve learned. Please be kind and respectful in the comments, even if you disagree with my advice, or if it’s not for you",Academic,Low,0.0,reddit:r/college,Low,0,5945,1039,0,Strategy for Making Friends in College.,0
"Absolutely. I was even going to say I understand classroom distractions. Only people with service dogs should have animals in the classroom. But if a college allows ESAs in dorms, and the dorm mates are okay with said animal. It should not matter. As long as the dog is trained to use the bathroom outside, and trained well enough to act like a good boy or girl while around people, I really think it's not a big deal. I live off campus because my dog is bigger. So it wouldn't be fair to my dog for me to live in a dorm with her. She deserves a hard and an apartment.

"I'm angry about the limitations of my body and this pandemic. I have experienced relatively serious seasonal allergies since I was a child. My parents didn't seek treatment for me beyond a battery of allergy pills since we all assumed that I would grow out of it, like they did and many other people do. Instead, my symptoms got worse as I got into my 20s and the allergy seasons seem to get longer and longer. Because things clearly weren't getting better on their own, I finally underwent formal allergy testing when I got to grad school. I was supposed to start allergy shots this March, but the sera for that literally arrived at the university clinic the afternoon that campus was shut down due to COVID-19. Although some non-emergency departments at the clinic have re-opened for treatment, there is still no re-opening planned for the allergy department, and no other allergy clinics near campus or my hometown are taking new patients for the foreseeable future. So, like so many other people with technically-not-an-emergency health conditions, I'm stuck. My symptoms include unpredictable and severe headaches and bouts of fatigue, which pose serious obstacles to studying. I'm going to have to seek academic accommodations for the fall if I want any hope of staying afloat, since I struggled significantly the past two semesters due to these symptoms. What really worries me is that my written qualifying exam is coming up in January; adhering to a study schedule has been a nightmare and I don't see academic accommodations giving me any kind of reprieve in this area. I'll take any advice, but honestly I just needed a space to vent about this. I'm tired of bringing up the (increasing) severity of my allergies or the treatment plan just for people to ask if I've tried Claritin, tell me that things can't possibly be so bad that I would want allergy shots, or something dumb and unsympathetic like that. \------------------ ETA: I just want to thank everyone who shared their suggestions and support. Just for some updates, in case anyone cares: The clinic is still closed for allergy shots, but my allergist told me that he heard it will open in September and that I've been bumped to the top of the queue.

"I believe my PhD advisor unethically utilizes AI tools to evade his professional responsibilities. I am a senior PhD student in the physical sciences at an extremely widely-known research institute in the United States, working for a PI who is well-established in his field. Over the course of my PhD, I've grown exceedingly discontent with the way my PI manages (or rather, doesn't manage) his lab. However, his recent reliance on commercial artificial intelligence tools has eroded any remaining respect that I held towards him. * He has publicly disclosed (*bragged*) to lab members during group meetings about using AI chatbots to write examination questions for the intro-level undergraduate course he teaches. * He sent out a group-wide email with an attached document that was clearly generated by AI. This document *poorly* summarizes a research topic that my PI is unfamiliar with, and contains a bibliography entirely composed of hallucinated references. He then instructs the group to compile all these fictional references into a dropbox folder and to prepare a presentation based on these imaginary articles. Obviously this is an impossible task. * He likely used AI tools to write sections of a recent grant proposal. I do not have direct evidence of this, but based on the reviewers' comments, it seems more likely than not. *""We""* applied for the NIH R35 together last cycle. I put *""We""* in quotes because my advisor did not contribute a single word or substantive idea to the research proposal; I wrote the entirety of the research strategy as well as most of the accompanying supporting documents. One of the few sections of the grant that my PI actually contributed to was the PEDP (Plan for Enhancing Diverse Perspectives). Here are the reviewer's comments about the PEDP section: Reviewer # | Comment ---|--- 1| ""The PEDP was described only in very general terms, without concrete in-depth consideration"" 2| "".the PEDP section appears underdeveloped and shows little connection to the proposed research activities."" 3 | ""PEDP does not appear to be integrated with the proposed research and is unlikely to have any meaningful impact."" Overall, we received a pretty decent impact score (30), and so part of me thinks that maybe the reviewers were just trying to find something to nitpick. But the rational part of my brain is saying that this PEDP document was generic slop from an AI chatbot, and the result was of such low quality that every reviewer felt the need to point it out. * One of our undergrads was applying for the NSF GRFP last cycle. Understandably, she took a few weeks off from research to prepare her application materials. My advisor wasn't super enthusiastic to hear this, and demanded an explanation from our undergraduate about her recent lack of experimental progress. Our undergrad responded by saying that she was struggling to write her research proposal, to which my PI responded with ""Just use ChatGPT to write it."" At the time, my colleagues brushed this off as a joke, but now I think this was an earnest suggestion. * My PI is also likely using AI to write letters of recommendations for his trainees. The same undergraduate student from the anecdote above was applying for something (either the GRFP or a graduate program). She requested a reference letter from my advisor and within 5-10 minutes of the request, she received an email notification that the letter had been uploaded to the portal. This is very suspicious because in the past, previous trainees would need to remind my advisor for weeks and weeks to get him to write a recommendation letter. I've told these stories to a few of my friends and colleagues and have received a mixed bag of responses. Most agree that this is highly unethical, but I also received a higher-than-expected number of responses saying that this behavior did not seem that serious or out of the ordinary.

"To include an author that is problematic on an article. Alright, so I’m working on writing up a research article for pub from my doctoral program. I am now a TT professor at another university, 3 years. I was the main researcher (development, data collection, and analysis) and writer of the document; however, I was working under my mentor at this time. It was a small project I was working on post dissertation data collection. If this would have been submitted at the time of data completion, I would’ve included my mentor on the author line. As it is now, this manuscript has been sitting in my “to do” folder in deference to other manuscripts, career, life, etc., and in that time, said mentor has left the previous university under alleged legal complaints (that I was privy to and believe due to recorded evidence although I was not the complainant(s)). From what I understand, they no longer work in academia due to the allegations. They also were not integral to the project in data collection, analysis, or writing of the manuscript. BUT with that said, I was able to use their lab space to collect my data (very generous) and they provided minor feedback to the development of the project. In any case, I am oscillating between including them on the author line because: 1) their suspicious exodus from the university and the ensuing drama from said exodus 2) their relative lack of involvement on the project aside from providing lab space 3) they were known, in grad school, for providing the minimum and requiring first authorship 4) to be honest, I’m also afraid of them finding a way to connect with me again However; 1) they did allow me to use their lab for data collection 2) they did provide minor feedback on the development Ugh, I wavered towards including them, but I’d like your feedback.

"AP Seminar IRR, keep getting flagged as ai even though it's original. Testing your IRR in a bunch of AI checkers always gets super confusing, half of them basically disagree with each other lol. The last time I was prepping my own report, I almost drove myself nuts changing every other word, worried some bot would nuke my grade. In the end, I realized dumbing it down just messed up my voice, so I stopped overthinking and focused on making it genuinely personal to what *I* found most surprising about my sources. If you want to keep your writing sharp without accidentally sounding robotic, I think varying your sentence lengths and dropping in little moments of doubt or surprise helps a ton (“I hadn’t expected.,” “weirdly, a pattern emerged.”). Sometimes just admitting you struggled to make sense of a source or include a random, honest opinion plants enough humanity into the text that AI detectors back off, at least in my experience. When I was double-checking my draft, I ran it through a mix of AIDetectPlus, GPTZero, and Copyleaks just to see if any flagged really weird sections. That helped me spot areas that kept tripping the detectors, especially paragraphs where I got too formal. I wouldn’t stress about it too much, though - College Board isn’t going to nuke your score unless your whole essay reads like a bot. What sources did you end up picking for your IRR?

"I built a simple students friendly app that makes expense tracking as simple as writing a Note✍️. As a student, most expenses are small but frequent — snacks, coffee/tea, transit, random online buys. And honestly, opening an app, tapping 5 buttons, selecting categories… it’s too much friction. So I’d stop tracking altogether. I just wanted something as simple as writing in a notebook. So I made [BudgetNotes ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.budget.notes)— where budgeting works exactly like writing notes. For example, you can just type: 15 Maggi 40 Coffee 120 Cab And it automatically becomes a budget list with totals. No forms. No categories. No friction. What I personally find useful is that you can also write thoughts next to expenses. Like: 300 Headphones → didn’t really need this It makes you more aware of your spending over time.

"Need assistance dealing with my advisor. I am studying towards a PhD in Statistics, and having recently completed all my required coursework and passed my comprehensive exams, I have been in straight researching this semester. I am fortunate enough to have a TA position from my school, which provides me with enough money to just get by in supporting myself. I have been working with my advisor for a few years now, and I genuinely enjoy working with him. However, this year I feel as though I have began to have more issues with him and I was wondering if I could get some feedback as to if these issues are genuine, or if I am just completely overthinking things. \-I feel as though my advisor does not know what I am doing/working on. He doesn't really keep up with I am doing, and as a result, our meetings typically follow the same 'formula'. My advisor will tell me that because of how busy he is there was no time for him look over what I have done or sent to him. He will ask me to remind him what I was working on and to write up summary reports for him to read before the next time we meet. Some of the research we are working on involves a few other collaborators, and as a result we will have group meetings on Skype fairly regularly. Within these meetings, I am always asked to carry our end of the conversation, and my advisor will ask clarification questions which directly relate to the reports I have previously emailed. \-I am becoming incredibly overwhelmed with the amount of work I am being asked to do. We are currently working on two projects, but on top of doing all of the coding and writing for these studies, my advisor will pile on new unrelated tasks every week. He will ask me to write up all of the grant applications we are going to apply for, collect every scholarly article I can find about particular topics, teach classes for him when he is out of town.etc. Last week he asked me to compile a list containing the contact info of every individual researching in our specific field in North America. As a result of these additional tasks, I feel as though I am struggling to get any work done, and have become very anxious. \-My advisor really wants me to go to conferences and present my research, and is constantly pressuring me to apply to these events. However, he has made it clear that he will not provide me with any travel funding whatsoever, and will repeatedly tell me of all the conferences he paid out of pocket to attend while he was doing his PhD. The first exposure with this issue occurred when, upon his recommendation I applied to attend a conference abroad in Europe. Upon being accepted to give this talk, he informed me that he couldn't fund my travel, and then proceeded to tell me the cheapest possible way to navigate my way around overseas. He suggested that I take the cheapest possible flight, then take a train and a ferry to the conference location, staying at hostels along the way before leaving directly after the talk, which would have ultimately used up all of my summer funding. I have attended one conference in my hometown which I paid for out of pocket, while it was a good experience, it took some time to recover financially. &amp;#x200B; I am sorry for the long post, I just needed to vent a little. Despite these issues, I do believe that my advisor wants what is best for me--he is relatively young and inexperienced with having graduate students.

"My Division 1 Crashout (ADVICE IF YOU CAN! &lt;3). Hello all! I joined today to ask about how I can better my living situation. So I (18f) am a freshman in college. I’ve always been ambitious and I love sitting down and doing school work, reading, all that jazz. I’ve been so excited to go to college since I first stepped foot on a college campus, in like 5th grade. I am a Bio major (specifically animal and human health) and hoping to be a doctor, but I am ever open to other paths. So…my story starts when I come to college. It’s a public college about an hour north from my home town, so I do have the advantage of going home on the weekends and also not too far if there’s an emergency. I have a car on campus so the world is my oyster. When I first arrived, I knew my roommate as we met on a little platform my college has to meet future students in your year. She ended up dropping out the next day, having only spent one night on campus. We left in good standing, me respecting her decision to drop out and pursue other endeavors. (We still keep in touch!) But…for the next half of the semester (it is November when I’m writing this, obviously) I had the fortune to live alone! I did keep everything on one side of the room as I did anticipate getting a new roommate. I was always open to the idea, after all. I am an extremely paranoid person so it was a nice idea to have someone else to hold down the fort if I wasn’t there. For reference, I usually leave early in the morning and don’t bother coming back to my dorm throughout the day. I just galavant from class to class and study in between. My campus is very pretty so I like to enjoy the sights. Now.cue an email from housing I receive about three weeks ago. We will call my new roommate G, for anonymity. G was fine at first, she actually knew me before so she got into contact with me and we even arranged our beds (lofted them on top of each other) and she was accommodating throughout it. She talked herself up a lot, claiming she was easygoing. I did warn her, however, I have OCD and my living space can greatly impact every other part of my life. So it’s important that the place I live is kept nicely. She insisted that she was clean, and we deviated from a traditional split-down-the middle and organized things less divided. However, within the week we spent together…she was extremely messy. Food messy. She ate in bed (top bunk) and the crumbs would fall down onto my bed (bottom bunk) and would always make up an excuse to be unable to clean it. She grew rude and took back her word on a lot of things. She also talked in her sleep…and woke up early, silencing her alarm every five minutes which would wake me up, too. What was so unfair about this situation… was that she got thrown into my room two days before the housing change window closes. Luckily, I submitted a request because I had some other issues living in this residence hall entirely. There were extremely rude people, my neighbors, who had even threatened me before (TL;DR I asked them to quiet down, they didn’t, so I called an RA. They threatened me.) So I was already looking for excuses to move out. I was really only hoping no one would move in. So, when someone did, I really had nothing holding me back. Presently…they care closed again. So I’m stuck with my current roommate. Fast forward and a panic attack later over coming back to food on my bed…I move halls to a much nicer, renovated hall. My current roommate, we’ll call her N, was kind and courteous. She still is…but she does not understand that I need my recharge time. Communicating with her can be tricky because she has ADHD and autism. Luckily she is cleaner for the most part, but a lot of things irk me. I hate feeling like I need to even clean her side— I never do, always respecting her belongings and space, but I just hate coming back to my dorm. On top of the nonstop talking to me even after discussing with her that I NEED my recharge time without talking…she snores. Loud. I’ve always been a light sleeper, and I just cannot get used to it. These past two weeks when I sleep on campus…I have not gotten over 4 hours of sleep. My grades are slipping. Im at a low point, a point I never thought would get so bad. I’ve never faced suicidal feelings before, but it seems that these past weeks I feel…out of place. Like I have no where to return to. I’ve always been ambitious and goal-driven, but I just feel like I can’t focus any more. Im sure the sleep really isn’t helping my mindset on top of usual seasonal sadness. I love this college. I love the campus, the environment. I love the classes offered and the professors too. I really, really don’t want to leave. I got a new therapist after opening up to my mom about these feelings. She’s worried, my family’s worried. My therapist wrote me a very brief letter in hopes to help me get a room accommodation where I can live in a single. I’ve been emailing housing trying to advocate for myself and explained my situation, and they have sent me some more details on ways to increase this chance of living alone. But, I want to see what other college students would have to say. Please let me know what I can do, I really can’t keep living like this. I’ve never really felt hopeless like this so Im sorry if this sounds super dramatic, but I’m sure we’ve all been there.

"Feeling very frustrated with my study choices, what should I do. **Background** Basically my entire life I had been coasting through school without issues. No high grades or anything, but I passed every course in due time. This was the case for elementary-, middle- and highschool. I then went on to complete my bachelors (undegrad) in Computer Science as well in 3 years without any delays. **Context** I was 21 at the time and immediately enrolled into a Masters program (Graduate) for Computer Science. However, around this time I started worrying about whether I had chosen the right career path.I started becoming interested in Business and Psychology and started looking for alternative study paths. I became so worried about making the ""wrong"" life choices that I decided to disenroll from my Masters program in Computer Science and instead enroll next year for a masters program in Business Informatics. This programme is advertised as a link between Business and IT, in the department of Information Sciences. **Current situation** This brings me to today. I am 23 years old and nearly finished a full year of this Business Informatics programme. Suddenly it struck me that some of the topics, like writing reports for instance, really does not interest me and that some of the courses are quite trivial and easy compared to my Computer Science classes. A lot of the business process analysis/modeling feels like a dumbed down version of Computer Science topics. I started looking into other people's experiences with CIS programs and similar fields. Most of them agreed that the course material is a step down from a Computer Science degree, and that the degree itself is less recognized by companies/employers. **Aftermath** I am so angry and dissapointed with myself for taking so much time to realize that I might not want this degree after all. I finished all the courses related to this Business Informatics programme for an entire year's worth of credits. I am very sad that the programme that I enrolled into nearly 2 years ago was the correct option after all and I was too blind to realise it. I feel like I wasted a lot of time and I am not even sure whether I can still apply for a Computer Science/Data Science MS programme for next year, the application deadline for some universities is already past. **Decision** Should I even consider going back to a MS degree in Computer Science/Data Science? Or have I invested too much time at this point and would it be ridiculous to put all the effort for this BI programme I put in to waste? I am stressed out right now by this choice and am looking for some wisdom before I make a stupid choice AGAIN. I am also not a very ""studious"" person. I'm worried about whether I'd even manage to study for another 2-3 years, especially when I could have been nearly done already! It is so frustrating. &amp;#x200B; Please let me know what you think of this situation and if I am being ridiculous. ***important info: I study in the Netherlands and tuition fees are very low here (about 2k a year), so I am not racking up a lot of debt.*** **TLDR;** * Finished Bachelor/Undergrad degree in Computer Science at 21. * enrolled for a MS degree in Computer Science, decided to quit and try MS in Business Informatics/CIS. * Thinking about quitting again and going back to MS in Computer Science, but wasted 2 years in the progress",Faculty,High,2.0,web:reddit:r/gradschool:search:fee issue,High,2,3382,585,6,"Feeling very frustrated with my study choices, what should I do.",0

"my anxiety has never been this bad and I don't know what to do. Sorry if this is a long one, I may waffle quite a bit but I just need to get this all off my chest regardless if anyone responds, it may even break the 'reassurance rule' but who knows, I don't really know what I want at this point. Uni student here. I'm currently studying Biomedical Science in the UK and I am currently halfway through my 2nd year. My entire university experience as a whole has been well and truly fucked thanks to C*VID and with hindsight I would have not enrolled at all, at least not until things were much better. I took the placement as a 'clearing spot' sort of on a whim because I was told the degree is extremely broad in relation to my chosen field of science (a love of mine, however my true passion lies with animals and animal care) and i wasn't sure where to go from my current position after just finishing college, where i had just graduated with a level 3 advanced technical diploma in Animal Management, focusing on animal science. For almost my entire life I have wanted to be a vet surgeon, but over time I felt like this was a somewhat unrealistic aspiration for me as I crave a good work/life balance so I've settled for wanting to simply work with animals abroad is some fashion, I'm trying to leave my options open. For a long time i was sort of predetermined to find a high paying job involving animals, naturally shooting for the stars but as I've gotten older and my outlook on life has changed I have come to despise formal education which I would require lots more of if I were to go the vet route, I've decided to prioritise being happy over a particular job instead. Now, my current predicament stems from C*VID and the complications it has caused essentially. For the majority of my first year I was commuting, which was fine with me as I'd done it for college for 2 years. Eventually I got my act together (its worth noting that I am a chronic procrastinator) and got a contract sorted to move into student accommodation where I could really experience everything Uni has to offer. I was there for 11 days before covid hit and I was called home, i never even got to go out and have some fun. As a result of this, I lost £1500 due to the fact that I paid out my rent in a lump sum as I was entering into a short term contract and I wasn't able to get that money back. I somehow managed to finish that year to a decent grade despite being locked down and ridiculously depressed for the first time in my life due to the stresses it caused. For the second year I had managed to enter into a house share with some friends I'd made with hopes for things to get better and they did, for a while. Then lockdown 2.0 hit and things got really fucking bad. Depression and anxiety were at an all time high. My work and eyesight were suffering from doing nothing but sit in front of a computer for 15+ hours a day reading notes off of slides and watching online lectures. My relationship with my housemates was deteriorating and i was smoking weed more often than i should have been as a coping mechanism for everything. Eventually I reached my breaking point and I wanted an out, so I finished the work required for my first semester and applied for an academic suspension so I could return and finish the year off a year later when things would hopefully be much better. This meant moving back home, getting a job and continuing to pay rent on a house I wasn't living in, which again tanked my mental health quite a bit. Fast forward to now and I seriously regret this decision. If I hadn't done this, I'd be close to completely finishing uni and having it all over and done with. My justification for suspending was that my education and mental health were suffering so much as a result of lockdown and I hadn't been on campus for over a year so coming back when I could get the most out of my money seemed like the most logical decision to make. Things were good just before I restarted at the beginning of February. I had moved out into my own space, i was exercising regularly, my diet was really good, I hadn't been smoking at all, I was organised and I was even keeping a journal, life was good. Until the first week of lectures. Up until then I was keeping good track of all my work and then I got hit with the flu which had me bedridden for a few days and completely fucked my routine up and I still haven't recovered from that. I also started smoking again which is seeming to exacerbate my issues. It's now been nearly 2 months since I started uni again and I hate it. I've not been keeping up with the work nor have I been on campus in weeks. I dont know anyone on my course as im now in what was the year group below me. My depression and anxiety keep fluctuating like crazy and my anxiety is now so bad to the point where I get muscle tics. Thinking about doing the work now makes me anxious as it is, then I remember I still have a whole year ahead of me including a dissertation which makes me feel sick to my stomach. I'm really in a dilemma at the moment and my head is in tatters. I want to drop out because naturally it is the easiest way to put a stop to all of the things causing my current problems and at this point I feel like my degree wouldn't even be worth it, at least not functionally, as I can barely remember a single thing from the last year and a half in regards to uni and im basically just working assignment to assignment to get it submitted regardless of the quality. I simply don't have the motivation or the heart to put serious effort into my work anymore, I just want it over and done with so I can continue with my life, where ever that may take me. I also want to stay because I don't want to be a quitter and give everything up after the time and debt I'm now in. Again, sorry for the waffling. I understand I'm certainly not the only one with these kind of problems but I'm going to reach an ultimatum at some point and I just want to make sure I make the right decision. Im not even sure what advice I'm looking for. Justification I suppose? I dont know. I've talked to friends and family and they pretty much unanimously agree I should just crank it out and get it over and done with and that regardless of what you know the degree will still look good on me and open doors that otherwise woudlnt be there at all, but ultimately they just want me to be happy and to not factor in their opinions into my decision too much as they'd be proud of me regardless, which I agree with but my mental state is currently struggling to accept and take on board. I want to do as much travelling as possible once I'm out of my current predicament and just live my life a little, would my degree help with this? Does anyone with a Biomedical or similar degree know if what I'm doing is worth it, considering my life goals and aspirations? Anything to help shed some light or broaden my perspective at this point. I feel like the stress this is causing me now simply isn't worth the opportunities that become available to me that I may not even end up using. I'm sure I could get a job I'd be happy in using the diploma I already have, but that could just be the stressed irrational me talking.

"I have a suite mate from hell and want to hear your stories of awful roommates/suite mates/neighbors. At the end of my first semester in college I was in my suite mate’s room and when I sat on her bed I felt something vibrating and when I looked under the sheet I saw that the vibrations were coming from my electric toothbrush which I used three times per day for the entire semester. Since I am a nice person, when I told the RA about it I asked her for advice. I also asked her not to report her for sexual harassment. Since you’re probably wondering why I was so nice about it, I’ll tell you. The reason is because I don’t have the heart to get her kicked out. She has pretty bad autism and has never been treated, so she didn’t really understand what she was doing. I also had pretty bad autism as a child, but I was fortunate enough to get help and can now understand what is acceptable (for the most part). Another reason is because I know she isn’t trying to be a room mate from hell, because when I’m sad or have a PTSD attack she comforts me. She is honestly one of the sweetest people I have ever met. She just doesn’t understand social norms. I gave her a lecture on deviant behavior the other morning. I would have given her a lecture sooner, but I had to figure out how to explain what masturbation is and that masturbation isn’t wrong, but that you can’t do it with other people’s stuff.

"Sad Senior Rant (feel free to skip). Yesterday, I got rejected from RISD, and, by extension, the Brown-RISD program. Having been told by parents, teachers and peers that I had a good chance, and having myself stalked every possible current student and portfolio I could find online, I was really hopeful. Upon reflecting on my rejection, I realized that perhaps what I had considered my best work didn't reach the global standards. My parents - who have encouraged me constantly (certainly a luxury and privilege I am SO grateful for) - were worried that perhaps they hadn't done enough. Yes, I know that most parents are surprised when their children don't get into a particularly good college, and yes, they're certainly biased. I know it is stupid to be so ungrateful with COVID-19, which is why this post is mostly for me to find an alternative to stewing and brooding about a decision that has as much to do with me as it does the school's priorities; at the end of the day, I am 100% certain there were people more talented/hardworking than me that deserved to get in. My only point of annoyance is that some people also had a much more guided process in crafting their applications. For instance, while I consistently formally requested our school to provide an IGCSE art and design course, they refused and only implemented it a year later. Because it was no longer available to me in 10th, I met weekly with the current teacher and worked on submissions the 9th graders were working on while completing my own 10 subjects. I say this just to show that I really tried to commit to the arts while shouldering other responsibilities. I researched all free course opportunities online and audited several courses on skillshare, craftsy/bluprint and coursera (as these were a little expensive). In IB, we VA students were given a (literally) rat-infested classroom despite paying a hefty sum for the school fee and the first teacher refused to guide us and was fixated on creating realistic observational drawings. The second teacher - my first real mentor in visual arts - was hired \~6 months before applications and had to teach 2 curricula they were completely unaware of before this. They have been an incredible mentor, but because they arrived so late, most of my portfolio had to be completed while I was dealing with the workload of the full IBDP course. Yes, perhaps this was a bad choice on my part to take IBDP, but I guess my complaint is that these schools often don't take into account the difficulty that location causes students. For instance, for a particular science experiment, it took around 2-3 weeks to procure wooden dowels that might've taken a day to obtain from any American craft store (I used to live there). Most projects involve this level of logistical difficulty, and on top of that, the area where I live constantly prioritizes science over art - as I perform decently well academically, I am more prone to this - so I didn't receive actual artistic attention (for a formal academic course) until a few months ago. What I'm trying to say is, I remember growing up in the US and not at all counting my blessings. I only realized once I moved that its so much harder to do everything as an international student. The biggest thing in the US that is in students' favor is the FREE education system. I know that my peers are probably a lot nicer than I was, and understand much better the struggles of applying internationally. But I'm really irritated that most people still don't seem to understand the day-to-day difficulties of this kind of education. I am certain that if I had been afforded more opportunity, I would have been able to take away a lot more from it and perhaps even gotten into RISD. Maybe I'm completely wrong, but I still believe that location and instruction really factored into my own ability to build a portfolio - RISD may have been right in rejecting my body of work, but I feel like they neglected my potential to grow by overlooking the sparsity of opportunities I was given, and how I tried to do the most I could with them. I think everyone who got in certainly deserved to. I guess at the end of the day, I'm just complaining about how life is unfair, and that's something I'll have to get used to. But I hope that admissions officers can also be more aware in the future about the inherent inequality in the situations of applicants. And I'm not just talking about the best/T20 schools out there or the best in each field. I mean other schools - schools that matter to just as many people - as well.

"How to salvage degree. I'm currently in my 4th year doing my biology.

"Coronavirus is an Opportunity for our Generation to Combat Economic Inequality. 2020 in the USA is a time marked by absurd wealth inequality, a plurality of Americans working as wage slaves, with or without collegiate degrees and the associated debts, and a fragile economic system marked by the ""need"" for two trillion+ dollar stimulus packages since the turn of the millennium. Student loans are a relatively risk free loan, in the sense that you cannot default on them, it takes 30 years of living in destitution for them to be forgiven, and your death bequeaths these debts onto your children. However, *student loans are not offered at prime lending rate*. That is to say, many loans that are considered a *greater financial risk* to the lender are offered at prime lending or close to it, while our perma-loans are nearly twice as expensive or more. The conclusion is clear: our generation has failed to collectively bargain in the fashion that the ruling class of our society continues to, especially now. We stand at a precipice. Unemployment and social unrest are rapidly increasing as our federal government continues to prioritize economic gains at the expense of the health of our people. Trillions of dollars were fed into a thinly veiled pump and dump of our stock market, meanwhile most students in this country will see no financial aid from the government. Those who graduated before and have entered the workplace fare no better. As workers are furloughed in increasing numbers, rent payments have not ceased. Student loan debt continues to accrue interest. Complaints against this odious system are gaining a critical mass. We are frustrated by a world where we find financial ruin by quarantining, or find that same ruin by seeking medical help with an almost unpayable price. Most Americans support Medicaid for all, and yet this is argued upon podiums as if a contentious or unfeasible issue. Even notable celebrities are starting to comment on the systems of wealth inequality that punish us all - Brittney Spears and Fran Drescher caught my eye just today. If rich socialites can speak freely on the internet regarding fiscal disobedience, so can we. Now is a crucial moment when people are paying attention to their screens, having nothing better to do. now is a crucial moment when the government is ill-equipped to reign in a collective political force motivated by dissatisfaction at the status quo. #Is this the time when we start collectively deciding not to repay student loans?",Fees,Medium,1.0,web:reddit:r/college:search:complaint,Medium,1,2509,417,7,Coronavirus is an Opportunity for our Generation to Combat Economic Inequality.,0

"I’m starting to believe the real problem isn’t students failing college. It’s college failing every student who touches it. Honestly I feel like I’m losing my mind with how messed up college actually is. I don’t know how we’re all just accepting this like it’s normal. We’re taking four or five full workload classes at the same time, each with hours of reading, labs, papers, discussions, exams, group projects, quizzes, software to learn, all on completely different schedules, all with completely different expectations. Then professors act confused when half the class is behind. Like bro you gave us a three hour assignment on top of a full week of work from every other class. What did you think was going to happen. I see people walking around like zombies. Everyone is tired. Everyone is overwhelmed. Everyone is pretending they’re doing fine when they’re clearly falling apart. And every “solution” adults give us is stuff like “use a planner” or “start earlier” like that fixes a system that’s just not built for real humans. College isn’t even hard because the content is impossible. It’s hard because the structure is a disaster. No central organization. No clarity. No real way to keep track of everything unless you manually build your own complicated system. It feels like we’re juggling 20 different versions of school at once. And honestly that’s why a few of us started building Durify. We were tired of drowning and tired of acting like school has to be this chaotic. We wanted something that actually pulls your assignments together in one place so you can see what’s going on for once. Stuff the school should’ve already done, but hasn’t. It wasn’t even supposed to be a big project. It just came from the fact that we’re all struggling the same way, and nobody with power wants to admit the system is outdated. Students aren’t the problem. The setup is. I’m just tired of pretending this is normal. I’m tired of watching people burn out over stuff that could be fixed so easily if colleges actually cared about how students function instead of pretending we’re robots. If anyone wants to try it out, let me know. We’re giving it free to early users because we’re still figuring everything out and trying to get feedback.

"Is there a way to report harassment/bullying if I don't know the harasser/bully's name. I (22f and autistic) have been attending college for over a month now. My academic life has been alright. I was able to make friends as well. However, there has been some issues. So there's an English class I take. The professor enjoys talking to the students. He tends to joke and banter alot but at least he's more tame with it towards me. But of course because of that, sometimes the students and will banter and tease each other as well and with the professor sometimes. However, there's this one classmate (25f) in the course who does join in the bantering with others. However she has starting to somewhat pick on me. She seems to be the type to hide it with ""it's a joke"" but even if she was, she's not that ignorant. She could tell I feel uncomfortable around her. I did try to ignore her but it's been getting out of hand. Unlike my professor, she doesn't care when she's going too far. She seems to like getting a negative reaction from others, especially from ME. I don't know exactly why nor do I care why because there's never a good reason to continuously do something that will make someone uncomfortable. She's literally an adult and still acting like some high school mean girl. Yesterday, I finally spoke to my professor since he's been getting concerned with my mood shifts in class. I told him everything. Despite me not knowing the girl's name, he does. He at least understood how I felt. He even stated how while he does enjoy the bantering and teasing in class, he will not tolerate it if it goes too far, especially if someone is getting uncomfortable. He told me that he'll do something about it and have a word with her. I hope he means it. I could be wrong but I noticed how college seems to take bullying/harassment more seriously than middle/high school. Even if my professor's gonna take care of it, I still wonder if there's a way to get her name, just in case she attempts on retaliating. I could try using the student portal/Canvas but my professor doesn't use it, he just emails us for class announcements and reminders. And even if I were to find a list of names in my class, I may not be able to tell who's who if most don't have any profile pictures",Academic,High,2.0,web:reddit:r/college:search:attendance issue,High,2,2274,417,0,Is there a way to report harassment/bullying if I don't know the harasser/bully's name.,0

I've already talked to her about volume, but she seems to need more reminders and I don't want to keep reminding her each time. I go to the library to study but prefer my room, so it ends up being 50/50. I'm an introvert and it's also been difficult for me energy-wise, it feels like there's always a third person in the room. It no longer feels like my space. I bought airpods max specifically to be able to focus in my room, but her voice still comes through, and I cant keep blasting loud music in my ears when I'm studying. With that being said, she never calls at unreasonable hours (never in the mornings or past 10pmish), and I know it's also her room and within her rights to use the space however she wants. She's not a nightmare roommate that throws parties in the room, leaves trash everywhere, sexiles me 24/7, etc and I appreciate her friendship a lot too! I have really tried to be understanding this year (hence the airpods max, most of the time letting her call her bf and not commenting). Am I being unreasonably sensitive or is she being inconsiderate? A combination of both?

"I did answer the question though? If a student does what they can to make up for the class and assignment they miss, then they should be able to earn back the attendance credit. It's great that you offer buffer days, not every professor does. I also explicitly mention participation as being a valid way to grade, so I'm not sure why you assumed thar I think that students should get points for just sitting on their ass. Using the 100% on exam is completely different as well. If you study and try hard, you can earn that grade. If you get a question wrong, you lose points, simple as that. The difference is that you can earn a 100% by studying, and if you get something wrong you should have studied harder. Attendance doesn't have that, cause you can't just 'try harder' if you have a family emergency. That's why I think you should be able to earn back attendance credit by making up the work.

Please take down if not appropriate) So last year I was invited to speak at a small local conference by the largest industrial organisation in my field. As a post-doc at that time, I was ready to present free of charge, as we all tend to do in academia, as long as they covered my airfare, accommodation, and meals. But to my surprise they asked me to invoice them for a speaking fee too. I didn’t know what the going rate was so I charged them USD165. I knew I probably could have charged more but I wanted to be affordable so that they might invite me back in the future. And they did! So I charged 10% more this year accounting for inflation, though my partner said I should’ve gone even higher because I’ve been recently promoted too. They liked this year’s presentation so much that they’ve asked me back for a webinars and another in-person conference in a different city.

Anyways, I wanna go to a concert for the first time (my parents also think that concerts are satanic, if they find out I went I am dead).

"In my experience this is how my department handles **posters**, not papers. Pretty much anything can get you on a poster (e.g., minor edits to the final poster), but on papers, authorship is earned. I have 3 first author publications in prep right now (one is co-first author) and the ONLY names on there are people who have or are expected to at least contribute something. I would only extend guest authorship to people if I knew that they would help me in some capacity and they would also be interested in the work I was writing about, and my advisors have never pressured me to change that viewpoint. It's all about the culture of the department, which you're right, is in some ways unfair when someone is on 25 publications they did absolutely nothing on, and you're on maybe 7-8 that you worked SUBSTANTIALLY on.

"postdoc: lack of support from PI. As an international postdoctoral researcher based in the US, I've been consistently pushed by my mentor to publish and to continually raise the bar, even after meeting his previous standards. While I've successfully published in top journals multiple times as the lead author, handling most of the work myself, I must credit my mentor's persistent push for motivating me to expedite this process, as I lack the inherent drive to consistently grind. My mentor is diligent and hardworking, which makes it challenging to voice complaints. However, I've found he is not very supportive and selfish at times, especially when I felt pressured after a threat regarding my H1B working visa sponsorship if I didn't produce more publications. While I recognize the value I bring to the table, this situation has left me feeling uncomfortable and anxious, almost like a tool being utilized. Or I can't get support to conferences if my work is not accepted for presentation as a talk, but a poster. I feel I am an emotional punching bag for him to share his stress. Despite having got publications and being at a solid platform, I sometimes doubt about whether my mentor will provide a strong recommendation letter, when I pursue future positions (maybe I am just overthinking cause I fear he may use it as leverage again). My main struggle is feeling inadequately prepared to be independent and doubting my competitiveness in the job market. Perhaps I need more practice in presenting myself and applying for my own funding opportunities, both are limited by my citizenship/language barrier.

"My Pursuit of an MS Degree and Graduation Worries. I just want to make a post to share my experience with graduate school, vent a little, and maybe get some advice or encouragement. I'm feeling really stressed and worried and have been for some time, but I'm getting ready to graduate soon. This is increasing my anxiety. This will be a long post, as I mainly want to put all my experiences down and explain how I have snowballed into the place I am currently in. So I apologize for the length. &amp;#x200B; So I was born in. JK, I won't go back that far. &amp;#x200B; I graduated from undergrad near the top of my class with tons of recommendations and job offers out of the gate, and I felt really good. I worked for 3 years before deciding to go back to get my Masters. My last job was fun and rewarding, but it had a difficult social environment and tons of professional challenges. I had a research project from this position, where I was the lead author, and I was trying to complete the manuscript with a few of my old coworkers as coauthors. &amp;#x200B; I accepted a MS position at a lab in the southern US with prior warning that the advisor was difficult to work with. However, he seemed frank, and initially we got along great. I also enjoyed the work, my labmates, the school, and the location. I was highly motivated at this point and was always the first into the lab and last out, even coming in on weekends. I picked up another research project unrelated to my thesis work and had a draft nearly ready for submission by the end of my time there (6 months). I also took part in other graduate students research projects and assisted them since I had a higher level of coding skills and understanding of statistics than some of them. In addition, I picked up other research projects that had been dropped by his former grads who had moved on and had little time with their new jobs. I had not yet selected a thesis topic but had several options that I presented to him for consideration. He also had me meet with other potential researchers about working with them on a project, and there were no major issues with any of these. &amp;#x200B; About midway through my first semester, I began to see some of what I would call red flags in regard to my advisor. He spoke with general disrespect about other graduate students and his colleagues and joked about the low-level jobs obtained by his former graduate students. He also displayed emails sent to him by former graduate students seeking professional advice on the projector prior to the class he was teaching so everyone could read them. When I pointed this out, he said he knew. His teaching style was very erratic, and he seemed agitated by questions he was asked by students, generally responding in a snarky or disrespectful tone. Many of the other students expressed displeasure with him as a teacher. Other faculty members also insinuated to me that he was known for stealing research, but I never had any direct knowledge about this. &amp;#x200B; I started to run into a bit of trouble midway through the first semester after taking a 2-week research trip, which my advisor insisted I go on. On the day I returned, he gave me a test from his statistics class to take, saying he didn't want to give me any additional privileges by giving me time to prepare to dispute my absence. I passed, but with a less than excellent score. I also received a C in an intro to graduate school-type course since the email I sent about the research trip was not received and the absences counted against me. However, I received all A's and one B in my classes otherwise. There was also a conference I had no time to prepare for, which he insisted I present at, and he had some weird format he insisted I use that was antithetical to every rule of presentation I knew. I did it his way and received no questions, after which he came up to me and insisted I should have done the presentation in the manner in which I would have otherwise presented. &amp;#x200B; At this point, I was getting very frustrated with him, and it was finals week and I had tons of work and papers to write. The first day of finals week, he called me into his office, presented me with a letter of remediation, and told me I needed to review it to see if I agreed and sign it, or I couldn't remain in his lab. He had four points in the letter, which I don't remember word for word but were something like. I will participate in lab research projects, maintain excellent academic standing in classes, and do some other things that I cannot remember. I felt I had already achieved all of these things, and I asked him if he thought I hadn't. He told me he did think I had but stated he wanted to ensure I continued to and that if I didn't, this would allow him to remove my funding next semester, but that ""I should not view this as a punishment but a contract between us."" We already had an agreement, so I didn't know how to feel about it and disagreed, but I agreed to sign it so I could get back to work. Throughout the week, as I was trying to finish up my final projects for each of my classes, he continually scheduled meetings for me with other researchers to flesh out potential thesis projects. However, this left no time for me to work on my finals, and I remember staying up past 3 AM every day that week and waking at 5 to make it to school and get everything done. &amp;#x200B; I was fed up and went home to rest over the weekend, hoping I would feel better, but I was just so agitated I couldn't recover or stop thinking about everything and why he would do and say these things (I'm glossing over a lot of the little trivial details that tend to add up over time). When I left on Friday, I had no plan to quit, but by Monday, the idea of dealing with this man for another 2 years had convinced me to quit. I went in early to get the paperwork started and return my library books, and I had everything ready for him by the time he rolled into the office around 9. I knocked on his door, and he greeted me and asked if I was able to get to all the meetings and finish my finals last week, inquiring how I did. I told him I thought I did well on all my finals (and had) and that I did make it to all the meetings, and we briefly discussed some of the research proposals. I then finished the meeting by telling him I decided to leave the program and handed him a paper to sign in a similar manner to how he sprung the letter of remediation on me. He seemed shocked and refused to take the paper from me. He then told me he couldn't sign until I turned over all of the data, analysis, and writing I had done on research projects in his lab, including the manuscript I prepared (contracted through him), which he had not worked on. I complied, and when I returned to his office, the door was locked, and he did not respond when I knocked. I emailed him, asking to meet so I could get the paper signed, and asked if there was anything else he needed from me before he would do so. I waited until around lunch before deciding to go home and await his response since I had nothing to do in the lab. Around 3 in the afternoon, he replied that he had scheduled a meeting between himself, the dean, and me and asked if I could attend. We all met. I explained my reasons, and he walked out halfway through without saying a word. The dean asked if I still wanted to withdraw, and I said yes. I made my way to my advisor's office to get the paper signed, and he was in there with the lights off and his head down. I took a pen from his desk and slid the pen and paper over to him. He signed without looking or speaking to me. &amp;#x200B; I took about another year off and worked in a warehouse, which I actually enjoyed. I was pressured to pursue another graduate program by my parents despite not wanting to and still feeling burned out. I got into another program pretty fast, actually, with an older, more experienced advisor who I absolutely love. The advisor is well respected and great to work with, and the program is actually more prestigious. I was feeling pretty motivated and working well, to my surprise given the level of exhaustion I was still feeling and the worries that soon the other shoe would drop and I'd be back in hell again. Then COVID hit, and we had to work from home. Rent increased yearly, and the stipend wasn't as large as previously and didn't meet my needs to support myself. I also had teaching responsibilities and had to design labs that could be done online (difficult for an anatomy course that involves dissection and identification of specimens). Despite the challenge, I managed to persevere, despite some minor hiccups. But I couldn't afford rent on my stipend, so after speaking to my advisor and parents, we decided I could move out of state to stay with them and continue my research (there were some events I glossed over but had finished classes by this point mostly, and the rest could be online). However, I could no longer teach, and so there was no stipend. &amp;#x200B; My current research involves historical analysis of organismal catch and population demographics spread over a large geographic region. There is a lot of data from state, federal, and private institutions, and I'm modeling catch and population trends over time and in response to many environmental and anthropogenic covariates. It was hard to obtain a lot of the data due to everyone being out of the office during COVID, and it was even harder to make all the disparate sources of data work together. In some cases, the original research objectives are simply unattainable due to the sparsity of data. I slowly began to feel really burned out again as we shifted research objectives, searched for additional data, and changed methods. My access to my advisor and committee was reduced due to my physical distance (although my main advisor was great about always meeting me via video conference and provided a ton of support and advice, etc.). (I love this guy.) However, my productivity defiantly declined along with my motivation as I increasingly felt burned out. I wrote 1 of 3 chapters, with a large chunk of the third completed, but revisions and changes to the first took over a year (one chapter is just background information). &amp;#x200B; Fast forward to now, and I have a hard deadline to graduate in the spring. CH2 is complete but only reviewed by 2 of the 3 committee members (one may have forgotten I exist). CH3 is full of NULL results due to poor data. and I have to get everything wrapped up in a few months and defend. My advisor thinks I can do it, but I have my doubts. &amp;#x200B; I also feel like having taken 4.5 years to do my masters, plus the 1.5 years wasted in the previous attempt, has put me behind my peers. The lack of motivation and burnout I have had the last 2 or so years of this project also makes me worry that I will not get great recommendations (although my advisor hasn't suggested this). and I feel it will be hard to explain why it took me so long to get my MS to any future employer. I also feel my thesis is disappointing, and the work within it doesn't reflect even a tenth of the effort I put into trying to make something out of a bunch of old data that was never meant to go together in the first place. &amp;#x200B; Thanks for taking the time to read this, if anyone actually did. I just feel burned out and have this overwhelming sense of doom that I will fail or that even if I succeed, I will have no job prospects, and it will all be for nothing. I've had to give up on both the manuscript I was preparing with my coworkers from my last job and the manuscript from my first graduate school attempt. If I fail here, everything I've done for my entire adult life will have been wasted, and I already have next to nothing to show for my efforts (which is a bad feeling)",Examination,High,2.0,web:reddit:r/gradschool:search:attendance issue,High,2,11878,2208,5,My Pursuit of an MS Degree and Graduation Worries.,0

"Speaker Fees (Zoom). If you have somebody Zoom in to speak to your class, what do you normally pay them? I'm in the humanities (tenure-track faculty going into my second year so still pretty new to the institution). I am hoping to have someone related to my field (in an adjacent non-profit role) come speak to my class on day in a 75 minute class session (so maybe 1 hour long presentation and discussion?). She agreed to come and said she could re-use one of a couple of lectures she's recently given elsewhere, so sent me the descriptions to choose from. I had asked what her fee might be, so as for payment she said, ""I'm sure your university has a standard rate"" and that she would want the university to make sure to include enough to cover international wiring fees. To be honest, I don't think my uni or a dept does have any standard payment rate for speakers, and there aren't any dept funds for this so it would be me paying her directly out of my pocket. (I did ask my chair once about this, and though he didn't seem offended by the question or necessarily rule it out in every case, he basically said that's not done and that it's assumed we are being paid to teach/cover our classes, which I get!) So though I did intend to pay her myself when I reached out to her, I was kind of tacken aback by the possible disconnect of her assuming there's standard university funds available for this and a little intimidated, wondering what she must be expecting.

"Should I get a different advisor. My advisor kinda messed me up academic wise. When I registered during my first semester at community college, I’ll admit my ACT score was low. So I knew I’d have to take a support class of some kind to make up for it. But my reading score was average, she signed me up for not one but two support classes didn’t do me any help at all. So that semester I technically only took 4 out of my 20 required classes. It got worse when I signed up for my spring semester. I told her I wanted to sign up for more than four classes. She looked at me like I had said something baffling. She pressured me into only taking 4 classes even after I told her I had a good feeling I wouldn’t pass my statistics class. Which meant I wouldn’t be able to go into my anatomy and physiology class for spring semester,She signed me up for it anyway. When the time came,I was a few points away from reaching the passing mark on my exam,I failed. And on top of that,I went from 4 to 3 classes. I even went back and set up a zoom call to discuss signing me up for another few classes after my grade. She told me the classes I needed were either full or in person on a different campus across the state.

"I'm worried that I'm not going to be successful in grad school. **Trigger Warning:** &gt;!Sexual Assault and Harassment!&lt; Hi everyone, I hope you're all doing well! I know a lot of people start college again this week, so if you are, good luck with your first day. First off, to everybody who reads this, I know this is a super long post, and I'm really sorry it is, but thank you for reading this. I'm a rising fourth year undergrad right now, and I'm honestly worried I'm not going to be ready for grad school. I was really lucky that my first year of college was great, and it was one of the best years of my life, despite us being online for most of the year and being on-campus for only two months. However, I had a change in heart in what I wanted to study, and decided to try to transfer schools. When I transferred right at the start of my second year of college, I was sexually harassed by more than five different groups of people. These incidents were incredibly hard for me because I have PTSD from being sexually assaulted multiple times since I was a kid by many different adults in my life, and experiencing harassment has made it hard for me to move on from my past. I noticed a lot of students at my new school don't take sexual assault and harassment seriously, which really made me feel unwelcome at my new school, and I still feel unwelcome here 2 years in. Additionally, I've found that student life at my new undergrad school is incredibly different from my former school, and I've found it really hard to make friends and form connections like I did at my former school. At my former school, it was very common to find groups of people just playing a board game together or talking about books they enjoyed together, etc. but at my current school, most people wanna talk about stocks, finance, and status. In other instances, a lot of them like going out to drink or use weed, and while I'm super happy for everyone who enjoys finance and drugs, I've had a lot of trouble finding others who like me aren't into those scenes. On top of this, I've found that I receive far less support from my professors at my new school versus my former one. I've had several professors that show up late to class repeatedly, and one professor who promised to write me a letter of rec forgot to submit them to several summer REU programs I applied to despite me reminding him three times by email, and it lead me to getting rejected from all of them. All of that has made me incredibly concerned that I'm not ready for grad school. I've been hearing from a lot of professors at my current school that to be prepared, we have to be able to be completely independent when necessary while also being willing to form connections and teamwork. I've spent most of my time at my new college alone, so while I have learned to become really independent, I've found it really lonely honestly, and I'm worried if I spend 5+ more years like this, I'll lose myself. Furthermore, if my grad school has a similar culture, I'm scared I will find myself unable to open up and form connections like I hope. Lastly, I just wanted to say I realize this post is so whiny and selfish, and I'm incredibly sorry about this. I don't blame anyone who sees it that way. I realize I have a lot to be grateful for in my life. The fact that I have loving parents and an amazing sister, food, shelter, water, and the ability to go to college to study a field I love are all things I am so thankful for and realize I can't take for granted, and I don't want to make light of this and I wanna use the privileges I have to try to make other people happy because if maybe my undergrad experience wasn't the best, maybe I can help the classmates I do meet have a better one. But I just can't help but worry I'm running in circles, and I'm so scared that when I go to grad school, I'll find myself in a position like I am in now again.

As both a former high school student and a current college student, I often struggled with one big question: how do you stand out when everyone is told to build a “passion project,” but no one tells you where to start? That experience inspired me to build a website designed to help students discover and develop passion projects based on their interests, skills, and goals. Instead of starting from scratch or copying ideas online, the platform guides users toward projects that feel personal, achievable, and meaningful. So here you go, it's still in it's testing phase, but I hope this can inspire some of you guys to start your own projects!

Hi all, I’m new here👋 a little background on me, an accounting &amp;amp; finance student in the UK currently on placement/internship year who is getting into final year this September, just wanted to get some opinions on module selection for the final year of studies and I’m officially unemployed😬😬 Currently I’m stuck between 4 optional modules to choose from, those being “private equity &amp;amp; venture capital”, “fintech &amp;amp; cryptocurrency”, “advanced management accounting” (not really looking forward to it if it’s compulsory hahah) and “information system &amp;amp; digital business”. After graduation I’m uncertain if I’m going for masters, if I’m not I’m looking to get into sectors like consulting, IB, other finance sector, auditing (this being the last due to I’ve had placement/internship experience with it and I decided not to place it as the first choice of job after graduation). I’m especially uncertain regarding the versatility among those subjects when it comes to getting a job (ideally those which are listed above) in the UK, or anywhere in the NA Can anyone who is in the similar situation, had similar experience, or even those who are working in one of those field provide some advice on this please?

"Ive hit an accademic dead end and i feel like the last three years of my life have been for nothing. i dont know if this is the right place to post this but i seriously need some advice by people who mightve been in the same place or that might be having a similar experience. i am 20 years old, I am greek and i entered university in 2023-24. I study civil engineering in the University of West Attica and have had experience in construction and development due to my family's background beforehand. im also really well versed in Construction Design and have always been proficient in designing. I also have Dyslexia. I was in a really bad place when i entered University as id lost my father recently, and also happened to break off from my childhood friend-group for some personal reasons, plus id gone through a really bad break up. Also it should be noted that due to the first major covid outbreak that hapoened when i was in the last year of middle school i graduated to highschool without having to pass any exams, and due to the field of study i chose in highschool I never had to concern myself with Physics or advanced math. Still, while covid was still at large we also barely ever studied properly due to always having online classes for about the first and a half year of highschool, so i never really got used to studying the proper way. Regardless I studied and entered Uni, even though i originally wanted Architecture but couldnt get high enough of an examination score to apply for it. I moved to Athens from my hometown and made it my priority to get back on my feet. I barely had any friends for a while but eventually throughout the first two years of my stay in Athens i managed to change that, and regain some of my confidence. Studying was a different matter all together though; much of what we had done in the field of study id chosen in highschool - which mind you was construction related and meant to teach us what we would need to know in order to perform well in Universities such as the one im in now - basically only covered 30% of what we are studying now, and that 30% is only barely related to what we were tought. So i entered the first class of the year and the teacher kicked both me and at least 5 other people out once he heard what field of study we were in at high school, because he knew we hadnt been tought any of the math required for it. I mean dont get me wrong, I still dont know squat about the equations they are teaching us, but i was barely 20, and had no right to be sure about this university being the right choice for them, their job is to teach me about it and to convince me i made the right choice isnt it? No one owes me shit, i hear you say. Well yes they dont owe \*me\* anything sure, but, they do actually, owe everyone that got accepted in their institution something else, and that is reassurance that they didnt work their asses off for nothing. All my friends from different Universities have not once told me they feel they dont know what their doing, and they feel good with their chosen field and are also doing good - where as i have not felt for one second that what ive been doing has any meaning. I went in some of the other math classes but i couldnt really follow them and the same was the case for physics-related classes. I tried going to tutoring centers for said classes in my second year, and filled my schedule to the brim with classes from both the TC's and university to the point where i had barely enough free time to get a meal and still i understood and passed absolutely nothing. The few classes that i passed are the ones that actually had to do anything with the proffession im supposedly being taught how to perform one day, but they are only like 8 out of the 70 we have throughout the 5 years of University, and 4 out of these were team projects so i couldnt even claim the full credit for the work i did. I really want to be a civil engineer but i cant actually perform in any of the subjects because most are based on knowledge i dont have, and i just dont have the option to try a colledge. So far i should have passed 31 classes and ive only passed 6, and the number of failed ones is only going to grow. There is nothing else im good at (that can be an actual job that will make me feel secure and capable of not only financially sustaining myself in the future, but also thriving, and feeling confident) besides construction, designing and developing, and there are no other universities that i can apply to that will let me properly accomplish any of this. Im almost 21, and I feel like im having a mid life crisis already, and the worst part? even if I do Graduate it wont matter. In this time i worked as an assistant for a Civil Engineer and also discussed the issue of what we are being taught with other professionals and they basically told me that the Degree doesnt matter in anything besides credentials and being able to sign your work, because most graduates barely know anything about what the actual job entails compared to people with actual experience. So with all that in mind; What the hell was the hole point? i struggled, i worked, i got into this fucking University and then studied even more just to barely make even, and never once have i felt rewarded just to be tought jack shit about the actual proffession so what the hell Have i wased these three years at anyway, and what should i do? There is nothing else im good at, and the only thing im good at is something i will likely never be able to actually perform as a job, so im stuck and have no options but to waste the next two years doing Tantalizing thankless work for no results what so ever because i just cant give up",Examination,Medium,1.0,reddit:r/university,Medium,1,5704,1082,5,Ive hit an accademic dead end and i feel like the last three years of my life have been for nothing.,0
"Weirdly easy ""upper level"" classes in my major. Ok hear me out on this one. If I took chemistry or physics I would not be making this post lol no matter where I went to school. I'm a double major, but one of my majors (biology) is just weirdly. easy? We have some core requirements, but then it's VERY open ended to the point where each ""upper level"" class feels like a pass/fail elective. Basically in one of my upper level ecology classes the professor said that everyone would be getting A's even if they turned work in late. Our final was a ""group art piece."" I had a neuroscience teacher who gave so much extra credit everyone was getting 15/10 on quizzes. He also brought it food every class and we ended 15 minutes consistently every class. I guess I'm learning some things, but I don't feel like I'm getting my $$ worth. I'm at the point where I can't relate to other people who have the same major because their classes are so much harder and they actually have final exams. What am I doing wrong?

"Advice: Leaving an Internship Week One. I'm an advanced standing social work graduate student, with a family. My daughter is eight years old with high functioning Autism and some emotional issues and I'm commuting to NYC from NJ for both school and internship. I also have some mental health and other disabilities I've dealt with most of my life, which is why I chose my school and my career field. My concentration in school is policy in contemporary social issues. I was lucky enough even after almost 10 years not working to be offered a handful of interview to go on two, be offered both, and take one at a prestigious research academy. Unfortunately, hindsight is 20/20, and I'm realizing that my choice was based mostly on prestige and how great it would look on my resume post graduation. The work itself seems a bit too ambiguous, and because of the type of organization it is, and the department I'll be working in its more separate from population contact than I would like. It's pretty much completely research based with a lot of project variation. I've immediately felt that I wouldn't connect with the staff the department who are all really nice people which makes things even more difficult. I find it harder to say I might have trouble working with nice people because that just sounds terrible, but in reality, I feel a totally lack of connection, greater than first week nerves that I don't forsee ever coming to fruition. The next issue is my commute. It's location in the city makes my commute awful because of its abscence of good subway access making my 7 hours of interning into a nearly 12 hour day. A few of these things may be managable to me, but not all of them on top of each other; then on my second day the icing on my cake came. I was told that the dress code was business casual with a more casual leaning prior to starting. For my first day however I wanted to dress to impress, I wore a nice floral dress, below the kneee length, it wasn't high cut, but wasn't low cut either, and I added a nice blazer to compensate for the fact that it was sleeveless and that I had somewhat large breasts; which can make a some cuts seem lower than they are. I asked the opinions of others before walking out of the house and felt proud and professional. The first day I was taken on an orientation tour and introduced to every department head, including the president. Between my first and second day I received an email from HR asking if I could stop in at 10:30 when I came the following day, I assumed it was to pick up my ID. I arrived at 8:30am the next day, after missing two trains and walking a mile from the subway, and fixing my computer to another email asking if I could come sooner. When I arrived, I was asked to sit. The casual nature of the dress code was again explained, and then I was told that the president was ""offended by my breasts"" when she saw me. What I was currently wearing was fine, but keep it covered because she (the president) ""found my attire really offensive."" I've been sexually harassed by men in the work place, I've been cat called, I've been a lot of things, but I have never been so insulted in my life. I was so shocked I could barely react and when through the day just trying not to cry and thinking of ways I could never show my face there again. I emailed my field placement person at my school, who I think seemed sympathetic and possibly wasn't once I told her I had yet to say anything to my task supervisor at the internship. I honestly don't know what to do, I feel like I can't do this internship, and the whole thing makes me question even attending grad school. I also don't know how to even bridge the conversation with my agency task supervisor.

"How thoroughly are you learning the material from your classes. One of my biggest regrets of undergrad was not being able to fully understand the material. Even when I got an A in a class, I often felt like I was just learning material to do well on an exam. That was a huge motivator for me to pursue graduate education. I made it a goal in grad school to gain an extremely thorough understanding of all the material in my classes - I was thinking reading every single page of assigned reading, understanding the derivation of every single equation from first principles, doing every single optional problem, and understanding on a fundamental level why every single step in every problem or method is done the way it is. For example, I wanted to understand Legendre transforms not as ""that thing you do to go between U, H, G, and F"" but as a fundamental mathematical construct and be able to apply it to unfamiliar systems, and I wanted to understand Bragg's law not just as ""the formula to calculate coherent scattering in crystals"" but also how to derive it from the Laue equations and apply it to reciprocal lattice. However, after starting school, it's pretty clear that there's just not enough time in the day to learn everything to that depth, and I'm reminded every time the professor says ""you don't need to know that for this class"" or the textbook says ""the proof is beyond the scope of this text."" After doing homework, learning exam material and stuff for my research, TAing, and household chores, there's just not much time left for ""extracurricular"" studying. Does anyone feel the same way?

Everyone has heard of the recommendation of studying “2 hours outside class for every 1 credit hour” a week thing but I can’t even get CLOSE to that.

I would show up to class half paying attention and maybe review for an hour TOPS the evening before an exam and got As.

"This sounds…strange. I don’t believe we’re getting the whole story. With sixty credits, a 4.0, and a first authorship, after seven years you’d be close enough to defending that from an advisor’s perspective, it’s more injurious to lose you than to just push you through a dissertation defence unless you completely left and refused to perform. Even handing you off to junior faculty who need a successful dissertation defence for tenure/promotion would be preferable to having you walk away after all that work, unless you failed the qualifying exams of something, but I doubt you’d be at quals at 60 credits and seven years unless you put them off for too long and were dismissed for that. Advisors are measured by their effectiveness — how many graduate students they’re getting graduated, and other metrics which vary by department and college. But no advisor is going to have a track record of losing or dumping graduate students and remain in good standing with their peers and the head of the department. It just doesn’t work that way. It sounds like this may be recent and you’re upset. What about regrouping and trying to explain again exactly what happened? There are many people here who are willing to help, but the facts have to be calmly and clearly articulated in a realistic, coherent manner. I’m sorry you’re upset right now, but as it stands, the closest sense I can make of what you’ve said is that maybe you put off sitting for quals, the department sent you formal notice to sit or take a hike by x date, you got sick, didn’t sit, and were dismissed.

"UW Madison or CU Boulder. Title: UW Madison or CU Boulder for undergrad? Hi, I’m an international student who got accepted to both UW Madison and CU Boulder. I’m going for UWMadison’s Geology/Geophysics program and Boulder’s Geological Sciences. I’m really torn between the two options. Additionally, my undergraduate studies are going to be sponsored by a scholarship program and they just sent the initial university placement emails today. Apparently, the Placement Team thinks CU Boulder is the better option because it is highly ranked in my major, and because there is no saturation issues like in UWMadison? Many students sponsored by the scholarship attend UW Madison as well so they prefer CU Boulder. They still gave me the opportunity to add my rationale as to why I prefer UW Madison over Boulder, but their response was that the rationale I provided was also true for Boulder, while also facing less saturation issues, which makes it the preferred final placement for me. The rationale I provided was: **“1. Academic Reputation: Both UW Madison and CU Boulder have strong geology and geophysics programs, but UW Madison has consistently been ranked among the top universities and specially in geoscience programs in the United States. The university has a long-standing reputation for excellence in research and teaching in these fields, which can provide a high-quality education and open doors to future opportunities. CU Boulder may be higher ranked in my major but considering the other factors mentioned next, I think UW Madison's pros outweighs the cons. It’s also a more well-known academic institution for research.** **2. Faculty Expertise and Research Opportunities: having looked into the faculty members and their areas of expertise in the geology/geophysics departments at both universities, UW Madison has a diverse and accomplished faculty who are involved in research across various sub-disciplines of geology and geophysics. Engaging in research projects alongside Madison’s experienced faculty can be an amazing experience for my academic and professional development.** **3. Facilities and Resources: considering the facilities and resources available to students at each institution, UW Madison boasts laboratories, field equipment, and research facilities, providing students with hands-on experiences and access to advanced technology. These resources can enhance my learning experience and help me develop practical skills that are essential in the field. They also have other amazing resources that students can utilize to support them in their academic journey during their time at the University.** **4. UW Madison has strong ties with both local and national industry partners, offering opportunities for internships, networking, and potential job placements. In addition to that, the university's strong reputation in the field can be advantageous after graduation.** **5. Location and Field Opportunities: Considering the geographical location of the universities and the field opportunities they offer, Boulder is located near the Rocky Mountains, providing geology/geophysics students with easy access to diverse geological formations and natural resources. I specifically mentioned this on the survey without giving Madison much thought. On the other hand, UW Madison is situated in the Midwest, which offers unique geological features, including the Great Lakes region and glacial landscapes. Considering that UW Madison’s location aligns with my specific interests and the types of field experiences I hope to gain, UW Madison seems to be the better option for me.** **6. Campus Culture and Student Life: Taking into account the overall campus culture and student life at each university, UW Madison is known for its inclusive campus community with numerous student organizations, extracurricular activities, and cultural events. As I come from a biracial background, these aspects of UW Madison really appeal to me. The diverse social and cultural aspects that are very important to me and the university environment at UW Madison, I strongly believe will contribute to my personal growth and well-being.** **My decision between UW Madison and CU Boulder for a geology/geophysics major is based on my preferences, career goals, and the specific opportunities each university offers. After careful consideration of each University and talking to a student from the same scholarship program who is currently studying at Madison and also happens to be a Geology/Geophysics major as well, I gathered as much information as possible to make an informed decision that aligned with my aspirations.”** They also gave me the contact information of a student to get in touch with. She’s a senior from the same program, who is currently studying at CU Boulder. I asked her a bunch of questions but I still don’t feel satisfied. She’s a ChemE major and she told me she doesn’t know a lot of students pursuing the same major as I, so she can’t tell if the program is going to be “difficult,” but she thinks it’s going to be hard. I can’t make up my mind, where do you guys think I should go and why? I need help writing a rationale to convince them that UW is where I want to go, but I still am not 100% sure. I have relatives and family friends in Wisconsin. On the other hand, I don’t know a single person in Boulder, which might also make me a little biased toward Madison",Examination,Medium,1.0,web:pullpush:r/university:submission:placement,Medium,1,5410,853,5,UW Madison or CU Boulder.,0
"Hi all! I could use some advice. I was accepted to two grad school programs and am still feeling unsure about which program to choose and I need to make a decision very soon! Any advice appreciated! I was accepted into NYU's Silver School of Social Work to pursue my MSW. Pros: 1: A track to follow and a career path to follow once I graduate. 2: I basically grew up in NY, so I have a lot of connections there and friends and potential opportunities. 3: Transit is endless, I'm legally Blind so this is important. 4: A multitude of opportunities within the city. 5: Exploring a brand new field and seeing if it's the right fit. 6: Guaranteed field placements right away and experiences in the field. Cons: 1: So, so, so expensive! I attended BU for my undergrad, so have already been through the financial stress that comes with 60k+ a year schools and am not sure if a SW degree will make up for that financial burden. I know it's about the passion and not the money, but still. 2: I have my BS in Early Education and am pretty sure I do not want to continue to work in the classroom setting, I still want to work with children and families in some capacity, just not as a teacher. The issue is, I am not 100% sure if Social Work is for me either. I mainly applied cause I heard that the field was broad and would allow me to work and create change for those in need and was a track to follow. Aspects of the field appeal to me, but not really case management and more behind the scenes work, I love direct interaction and am just not 100% sure that I'll be happy as a SW. I also applied and was accepted to a Child Life MS program and that's a field I've had a long time passion for, but after doing more research and seeing the many barriers that often keep people from pursuing the field, I decided to defer with that program. I never has that innate spark with Social Work, it interests me, but I'm just not sure if I should invest all the money and time. 3: I love NY, I lived their for 13 years, but it's also an insane place to live and there are things that I HATE about it. (Garbage, nuts, constant vigilance, quality of life, etc) I'm note sure if I could deal with being there again full time. I love it, but it is intense to say the least. 4: Cost of living. 5: I already had my fed loans dismissed because of my disability, so in order to get more loans, I need to say that I am able to work and provide medical proof, not a problem, but then there's a big possibility the new loans and old loans which will be reactivated, will not be dismissed after I graduate. I know lots of people deal with student loan debt, but I'm worried about taking on so, so much debt for a field that historically doesn't pay that much. Other program is through UMass Boston, (I'm an in-state resident.) Called Global Inclusion and Social Development, an MA. Pros 1: So, so much cheaper then NYU, by a HUGE marin, as I'm a resident, so receive in-state tuition. Same deal with the loan dismissal thing, but I'd be taking on so, so much less debt. And if I ended up not liking the degree, it would a far less scary decision to leave the program or switch or something. 2: UMB has great resources, has a lovely campus and offers study abroad opportunities, something I really want to pursue, at a very affordable rate. 3: Is close to some of my family and Boston, which I love. 4: Pro/Con The major is very broad and is almost self designed, you make of it what you want. From their site the major description is: ""The 36-credit GISD MA program examines global, national, and local issues related to inclusion and social development. Students seek solutions to complex challenges in today’s rapidly changing society, such as health disparities, environmental justice, community development, participatory decision-making, and economic inequality, as well as discrimination based on gender, disability, sexual orientation, age, race, ethnicity, and economic status. Our graduates go on to serve as leaders in their communities, as well as in national and international nongovernmental organizations; local, regional, and national governments; foundations; community organizations; and the for-profit sphere. In all these roles, they work to increase inclusion and social development regionally, nationally, and globally."" Cons 1: Not a track or specific career to go into after graduation, it's a broad degree with a lot of different paths to go down. I feel lie in order to succeed, I really need to find a track to follow that will help me reach new and better opportunities, that I haven't been able to achieve through my BS degree. 2: Campus is more isolated and harder to reach. You have to take the subway (T) and then a shuttle bus. 3: Not a garmented field placement or internship, but can be built into your degree plan. &amp;#x200B; I'd love to hear your thought and any advice you can offer!

I regret to inform you that Mr. Fornetti has written so many, and so grave errors and wrong explanations on the first 50 pages (see the proof on the website below) that it was meaningless to read the rest of the book and write a complete evaluation. The errors have been pointed out and corrected in the critique of his book “Conquer Radio Frequency” which can be found at: https://conquerrf.wordpress.com/#story I have also sent the review to the two corporations AWR and Wolfspeed, who financed the creation, promotion, and selling of the multimedia package. A gentleman from Wolfspeed responded very briefly that they will take the complaint seriously. Few closing remarks about the nature of this quality issue. Among more than a dozen of serious errors, wrong formulas, and false explanations, Francesco has described an ideal inductor to be able to maintain a current flow out of one of its terminals, while no current enters into its other terminal. He also claimed that voltage is not a physical quantity, and that at low frequencies the power is not transmitted by electromagnetic fields. For those not familiar with electrical engineering, let me illustrate how big nonsense these are. It is like saying that a liquid can flow out from a funnel without the need to poor anything into it. The mentioned errors are only samplings from the first 48 pages, and there are many more errors in the rest of the book, which contains about 200 pages. I sincerely hope that something can be done to prevent future publishing of low quality text books full of conceptual errors in the name of real science.

"The asymmetry of ""turf wars"". I wonder if others have run into this. I've been accused of engaging in ""turf wars"" a few times. And it's true I have attempted to defend my area and my ability to contribute to it. But that's come in response to others trying to expand their own turf, or the accusations come from people who gleefully engage in their own turf wars. Just a few examples- my Department has a few sub-fields. One sub-field is always fighting to ensure it gets more resources, hiring lines, etc. When, in a recent hiring discussion, I pointed out that my sub-field now has fewer people than the supposedly embattled one and the last hire went to them, I was accused of fighting to defend my turf. I run an interdisciplinary program. Supposedly interdisciplinary, but when I took over it only had classes from one Department. So I decided to expand that. Not remove their courses, but also require classes from other Departments (including mine). I got attacked via ""reply all"" for engaging in a turf war. My Department is debating a spousal hire, the partner of someone being hired by a different Department. This person basically teaches the same things I do, so I suggested we have a discussion about what they would teach so there's not overlap. I was attacked by someone for ""defending my turf."" Ironically, this person frequently goes after anyone who tries to get research money or offer classes that are in their area. I think it's a function of me being newer. The other people were here first, their turf wars are normalized, so I'm seen as the problem.

"Flunked out because I can't focus and I don't know how to get better. So after a streak of bad semesters I was dismissed from my university and will allow to be re-enrolled after a semester. I was diagnosed over the summer with ADHD but I also struggle with anxiety; have had a few deaths in the family and health issues since I started college so overall I tried to give myself some grace for failing but I'm so sad. The truth is I had the entire semester and all the cards to succeed the semester but every time I tried to do work I couldn't focus. I would go to the library and try to read then go on my phone then cried because I felt so guilty for not doing the one thing I should be doing and somehow still not doing it even after feeling guilty. I procrastinate everything and I lost my sense of urgency--missing an exam or an important deadline doesn't affect me anymore. Failing my classes makes me feel lazy and even dumb, even though when I'm able to get some work done I think to myself ""damn, this was easy--even interesting, why didn't I do it by the deadline?"" It's so depressing to feel my potential slipping away. I am unmedicated for all these diagnosis and my therapist moved two months ago so I haven't been seeing anyone; she used CBT approaches anyway and I'm not sure if that helped. Again, I try to be kind to myself because I've spent the past years dealing with grief and depression but I just feel so stupid for failing instead of just getting off my phone and worked. I want to get better but now I genuinely don't trust myself--what if I go back to school and I still can't focus at all? Is it even possible to take proactive steps to stop procrastinating without medication? Is this beyond my control? Has anyone been in this boat before? I love learning, I love my major, and I want to get my degree more than anything.

"Realize, OP, that your vision of ""research"" sounds very much like STEM and lab-based impression. In many other fields, including most humanities research, people work alone; they don't have teams of grad students working on their projects and they aren't working in places/setting where you'd see them at work anyway. Many disciplines also rely on fieldwork, some of it in teams but much of it also solo. Today's philosophers, historians, theologians, ethicists, poets, literary scholars, and others pretty much work as they always have-- alone, with stacks of books and something to write with. None of my graduate committee, all of whom were accomplished scholars with many books to their name, worked with other people and they certainly did not work with groups of grad students. That said, the actual jobs of faculty (in the US at least) have changed dramatically even since I was a student in the 1980s. Back then the professoriate was still mostly male, mostly white, and there was an extensive apparatus supporting their work-- both formal and informal. There were secretaries that answered phones, type manuscripts, dealt with students, made copies, opened mail, manage budgets, and most other routine tasks that we do ourselves today. Perhaps more significantly, there were ""faculty wives"" who managed both the home and social engagements for many professors still, ""relieving"" them of duties around child-rearing, cooking, cleaning, and normal household labor that is far more often shared today (because faculty aren't paid enough to live on a single salary, and of course because women have lives outside the home now too). Teaching and tending to students has expanded to take up incredible amounts of time too-- no longer do most faculty simply walk into a lecture hall and repeat lectures written years before to masses of students who will eventually take exams that someone else grades. And of course the meetings.25-30% of my weekly work hours today are spent in meetings, far more than my professors did. And email?

"Could use another person’s opinion on this (Roommate Conflict). Hey everyone, I know this post is long but I’d appreciate it if you could read it 🥺. A TLDR is included but read if you need context. So I live in a suite with four people. Our room arrangement is a single/double/single, and the person in the first single (let’s call her Susan) recently brought a whole bunch of issues to me and my roommates attention (we occupy the double, and we’ll call her Eliza) She has avoided us since Nov. 6th (and no, it’s not because of U.S. election stuff, we all lean the same way) and last Thursday (Dec. 5th). Any time I’ve tried to talk to Susan since then, like when she’s coming back from class, I haven’t been able to as she closes her door and locks it before I even get the chance to speak to her (she rarely does this unless she’s sleeping) However, this past Thursday, Susan broke her silence. On Thursday afternoon, she came into our room and started scolding and yelling at us, about what issues she had about us. She didn’t ask if we were available to talk about it, she just came in our room and started yelling about it, when we were both busy doing something. Her complaints were as follows: - That our room has a slight odor and when we leave our door open it makes the hallway smell a bit (nothing too severe, but still a slight odor, nothing unpleasant), - That I broke her 80$ laptop charger (which I don’t remember doing, but I do break chargers a lot so it probably happened), - That our old suitemate that was in the other single moved out because of us, - That I’m using Susan for her money and resources (I asked for $20 last year and said I would pay her back, and while I planned to, I did not have a job back then, and wasn’t able to. We did come to somewhat of an agreement that I wouldn’t need to it her back because she broke my handmade pottery bowl I use to make ramen). All of her points are valid, as well as her feelings, and I’m not going to say that she’s wrong, cause I haven’t been the best suitemate, but the way she conducted herself and brought up the issues on Thursday was unacceptable. And it affected both me and Eliza as we were planning to go meet Hank Green (yes, that Hank Green) but now weren’t able to cause we felt like absolute shit. Which brings me to what I want to do and whether or not it’s justified in this situation. Yes, everything she said is fair and valid, but that doesn’t give her a right to come into me and Eliza’s room and start yelling at us, not giving us any input into the situation and cutting us off when we try to speak, have her little anger tantrum and then storm back to her room and lock the door again. While I do plan to pay her 80$ for her laptop charger (which is a crime to humanity, why is it that expensive), I’m not going to do so until we have a conversation like adults. My thinking for this situation is “I repay adults that act like adults, not adults that act like children”. Susan said that if I didn’t pay her back when I returned from winter break, she would tell the RA, and when I brought up the fact that it may take an extra week or two cause my work has been putting me on for less hours, she yelled at me and said that it had to be done by the moment I came back or she’d tell the RA. (I do currently have the money to pay her back, that Eliza has loaned me) She also wants to be an RA next year, but since I’m friends with ResLife and the person who does the RA interviews, I don’t feel comfortable recommending Susan to be an RA if this is how she handles conflict resolution. **Do I tell her that I’m only going to pay her back if we have an actual conversation about it and talk about it like adults, or should I just pay her back and move on?** Am I overreacting about the whole situation? Any extra input is appreciated. TLDR: Suitemate didn’t bring up the issues she had with me and my roommate in a civilized manner, basically just yelling and scolding us with no actual conversation going on, and I found out I owe her $80, which I don’t feel comfortable paying her back until we have an actual conversation about the issues she has with me.

"How to actually wake up in college. I am going to be a freshman this fall, and one thing I am worried about is not sleeping through my alarm but more importantly, not sleeping through any of my classes. I have a class at about 9am which would require me to be up by about 7:30 or so. However, one issue I face at home is sleeping through my phone alarms. I have tried everything: sleeping with my watch so it vibrates on max, turning up my phone alarm volume to max, and even setting obnoxious/scary noises to get me out of bed. Nothing seems to work; all are slept through no problem. I am a crazy deep sleeper, so I would appreciate it if any of you guys could give me advice on how to get up!

"Scan it and house it in the LMS so it isn't ""published"" for the public in general. The rule of thumb we always used when making *paper* copies of texts like this was keep it under 10% for fair use. If it's out-of-print and you're using only a small portion like this I would have no personal moral concerns about sharing it, though your campus may have different ideas about what is strictly legal. Back in the 80s it was commonplace for faculty to make up ""course packs"" that were just copies of articles/chapters for the entire semester, and then these were sold to the students by the bookstore. In the 90s many campuses got serious about copyright and we'd then have to license all that content (which is reasonable) so prices for those course packs often went up 10X. But since we moved to the LMS system and the ability to link ebooks/articles inside the course shell-- from the library --that's largely become practice.

"Sadness About Leaving. Hey you all! I'm a first-year College student getting ready to go back home next week! I have been feeling this unbelievable sadness since coming here. I've felt homesick, lonely, unhappy about my school's culture, uncomfortable, and just generally not drawn towards being in college. My counselor even told me I was showing signs of someone with clinical depression! I am coming towards the end of my first year, and I realized that the sadness I was feeling started waning away closer to the end of the year, which ironically makes me more sad now that I'm about to leave. People are already going home, and it's already starting to feel like a ghosttown in the dorms. I regret not documenting my life as much during my first-year. I realized I'll never be a freshman in college ever again, and the anticipation I felt about going to college when I was younger is now a realized part of my past. I'm going back to a life at home that I am grateful for, but feels incredibly mundane. Sometimes I feel the fantasy of going home after being away for so long is more exciting than actually going back home and back to your typical life.

"My OG Comment: Let's analyze your request Roadmap: **The Goal - Step 1, The Mehtod - Step 2, The Strategies** **The Goal:** To get back to work after taking a break **Step 1, The Method:** This is the overarching plan, aka *how* you'll accomplish the task: * Use a daily plan and “ease in” planning * Writing is one of the best ways to embed information into your mind. Therefore, you should create a daily plan with intentional breaks and time to get back to work. Before you start studying, copy out this plan onto paper. This should mentally remind you that there *is* a time to get back to work * Help for managing your time to put together a realistic yet effective daily plan is in Step 2 of this comment * Also, make sure to check tasks off of the plan as you get them done. Checking tasks off is a great addictive feeling. Therefore, you’ll be more motivated to get back to work so that you can check off the “get back to work” step on your daily plan * Taking photos of your progress on the plan at the end of each day is helpful as well. If you feel unmotivated, you can look back on your progress. Also, nobody wants to keep pictures of “take break ✅, get back to work ❌” in their phone, so it’s motivating that way as well * “Ease in” planning, as I call it, is when you begin with a super easy tasks and then work your way up. This helps you better transition from break to studying * For your “ease in”, you say something like “after my break, I’ll start reading over the notes for the next chapter, then I’ll read it again and try to comprehend it, then I’ll begin memorizing.” * It can also go the other way, “easing out” of your break time. For example, if your break was on YouTube, you can stop watching but continue listening to the video as you read for the first time and then turn it off for the second read and fully focus for the memorization **Step 2, The Strategies**: These are the individual tactics you'll use to carry out the method, aka *what* you will do * The most important strategies for this method are time management (when you put together the daily plan, you might as well make it useful to get all of your studying done in time) and focus (to help you concentrate when the break ends) * However, I know that I am not qualified to set in stone what the best study strategies are, but the *community of fellow students,* lots of whom are in similar situations, **are** * Therefore, I suggest referencing the [search page found in this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zk7xUZogIZSvDL0SE74qbEPtn-fYT7h_WNaEE5BP33g/edit?usp=sharing) * In under a minute, its top search result compiles what the majority of students decide as the most helpful study tips for any given topic, and its other results allow you to discover new tips from the community * Remember that this is not a one-use tool. The engine supports over 20 study skills (memorization, time management, math, etc), and you can search it whenever you have a problem studying. * Therefore, you can learn the most helpful tips, apply them, beat the issue, and get back to work * So go find those time management and focus tips, your studies won't complete themselves! :) Thanks for reading my answer, I wish you nothing but the best, Your friend, Dasani",Examination,Medium,1.0,web:pullpush:r/students:comment:issue,Medium,1,3261,592,5,"My OG Comment: Let's analyze your request Roadmap: **The Goal - Step 1, The Mehtod - Step 2, The Strategies** **The Goal:** To get back to work after taking a break **Step 1, The Method:** This is the overarching plan, a",0

"Students: This Safari extension just saved me hours on my coursework. Okay so I found **InVideoMark** completely by accident while looking for something else, and I genuinely think every student should know about it. This is the kind of tool that seems small until you actually use it, then you wonder how you studied without it. Here's the problem it solves: You're watching a lecture video or Khan Academy tutorial and the professor/instructor explains something perfectly. So you either: 1. **Pause and write down the timestamp** (then forget where you wrote it) 2. **Try to remember roughly where it was** (and spend 10 minutes scrubbing through the video later) 3. **Screenshot the exact moment** (your computer is now full of random screenshots) 4. **Rewatch the whole thing** (massive waste of time during exam prep) **InVideoMark just. fixes this.** Hit one key (Alt+B) and it saves the exact timestamp. Later, one click and you're at that moment. Done. **How it actually works:** While watching any YouTube video (lectures, Khan Academy, Crash Course, whatever): **Press Alt+B** — saves the exact timestamp where you are right now That's literally it. The bookmark appears in your extension, organized and searchable. When you want to revisit? Click the bookmark, jump straight to that moment. No scrubbing, no guessing, no rewatching 10 minutes of content to find the 30 seconds you need. **Why this is actually game-changing for students:** **For exam prep:** * Bookmark all the moments you find confusing or important while studying * Create a personal ""study guide"" of video timestamps * Night before the exam? Open your bookmarks and review only the parts you need * Instead of ""I should rewatch this whole lecture,"" it's ""I'll jump to the 5 moments I flagged"" * Actually saves hours during crunch time **For online courses:** * Professors post 50-minute lectures and expect you to watch them * Bookmark the key concepts, examples, and anything you don't understand * Creates a personal study guide without having to take separate notes * Review system: watch your bookmarks to see if you actually remember the material **For learning from multiple sources:** * Taking an online class? Supplement with YouTube tutorials * Bookmark the best explanation of each concept across different creators * Now you have your own curated ""best of"" library for each topic * Organize by subject or concept so it's actually useful later **For group study:** * Find a great explanation in a video * Bookmark it with a note (""This explains derivatives perfectly"") * Export your bookmarks and share them with study group friends * Everyone has a shared resource library instead of each person finding stuff separately **For research papers:** * Watching documentary-style videos for sources? * Bookmark the exact quotes or information you want to cite * Export your bookmarks, you have timestamps for everything you used * Actually cite where you got information from (no more vague ""I watched something about this"") **For keeping notes organized:** * Create video clips by marking start and end points * The video auto-pauses when it reaches the end * So if a concept is explained at 3:45-7:20, you can watch ONLY that part * No more ""find the right spot"" — just play the clip **Real examples (because this is actually useful):** **Scenario 1: You're struggling with calculus** * Watch Khan Academy on derivatives * At 4:32, he gives a perfect example that clicks for you — hit Alt+B * Later during exam prep: open your bookmarks, there it is, click it, watch that 30 seconds again * Remember the concept instantly without rewatching the whole 18-minute video **Scenario 2: You're in an online class and have to watch lectures** * Lecture is posted Monday, due to watch by Friday * Watch it, bookmark all the confusing parts, any important definitions, anything you think will be on the test * Now you have a personalized ""important moments"" guide * Rewatch only your bookmarks the night before the test (15 minutes instead of 50 minutes) **Scenario 3: Studying with friends** * You all found different YouTube channels explaining the same topic * Each person bookmarks the best parts of their resource * Everyone exports their bookmarks and shares them * Now you have a curated study library built by actual people, not an algorithm **Scenario 4: Writing a research paper** * Need to cite a specific moment from a documentary or educational video * Bookmark it with a note about what it proves/explains * Your bookmark has the exact timestamp * When you cite it, you have proof of exactly where the information came from **Features that actually matter for students:** * **Instant bookmarking** — Alt+B, super fast, doesn't interrupt your learning * **Video clips** — Mark where a concept starts and ends, auto-pauses so you don't overshoot * **Organize by subject** — Create categories like ""Biology,"" ""Spanish,"" ""Philosophy,"" etc. * **Add notes** — Remember WHY you bookmarked it (""this explains mitochondria perfectly"") * **Add tags** — Cross-reference topics (""photosynthesis,"" ""cell structure,"" ""exam 2 material"") * **Search everything** — Find bookmarks by title, video name, notes, tags, category * **Export to share** — Download as JSON and send to study group friends * **Works offline** — All your bookmarks are on your device, always accessible **For different types of students:** **High school students:** * Supplement teacher lectures with YouTube explanations * Keep everything organized so you don't lose your study resources * Exam prep becomes actually manageable **College students:** * Online lectures? Bookmark the important parts * Flipped classroom model? Bookmark before discussions * Night classes where you're fighting to stay awake? Review your bookmarks instead of rewatching **Students learning a language:** * Mark specific pronunciation moments * Bookmark grammar explanations that finally clicked * Create flashcard-style clips of vocab explanations * Share bookmarks with language study partners **Self-taught/online learning:** * Coursera, Udemy, YouTube tutorials — bookmark everything * Build your own personalized curriculum of what actually helped you learn * Organized learning instead of random bookmarks scattered everywhere **Students with ADHD or learning differences:** * Watch at your own pace, bookmark when something resonates * No pressure to take notes in real-time * Review your bookmarks later without judgment * Create a study guide that works with how YOUR brain learns **The only real limitation:** **Mac only** — You need a MacBook. If you're using Windows, ChromeOS, or just a PC for school, this won't work for you. (iPad support is coming eventually though.) **Privacy (actually relevant):** * Your bookmarks stay on YOUR device * No accounts, no tracking, no corporate data collection * No surprise algorithm trying to sell you premium courses based on what you watch * Optional iCloud backup if you want bookmarks across your devices * Export anytime, delete anytime — you own your data For students, this matters because you're not feeding some company data about how you study, what you're struggling with, etc. **Why I'm posting this:** Honestly because I wish I'd had this tool during my classes. It's simple, it's privacy-respecting, it actually saves time during the most stressful parts of being a student (midterm/final prep), and it costs basically nothing.

"So any referencing should have 2 types: An in text citation (Stuart et al., 2018) And the full citation in the bibliography. Which should include the authors names or authors et al if there are more than 2, the publishing journal or book name, the date it's published, the publisher, and the pages that you are talking about e.g. Chapter 7 from a book, or page 72 - 86 for where it is in the journal. Journal articles also need to have which volume and issue it was which can be in a variety of formats. Websites should also include the data accessed and the version number if available. I would highly recommend you use a referencing software which will halp you get the exact format for each style, as harvard and apa are different in how they order and punctuated information.

"My guess is a lot of people here are older humanities academics who feel really threatened with the rise of ChatGPT, especially as it has gotten better overtime at both summarizing knowledge with less hallucinations and writing high-quality text. As someone who went through graduate education before LLMs were around and have started using them more recently, I see them as very useful especially for giving me an introduction to a new topic or subfield - similar to Wikipedia, but more customizable. In other words, if you're just engaging at the undergraduate level to find basic facts, it's pretty solid in that regard. However, if you engage in deeper academic discussion, it becomes less precise and prone to hallucinations and inaccuracies. I've seen it claim that X author discusses Y theory in her work Z, but when you look up Z you find that's not true at all - it turns out Z is tangentially relevant to Y, but doesn't actually discuss it directly. Incredibly, if you bring this up to the LLM it'll admit its mistake and try to correct itself, sometimes successfully, sometimes not. This is obviously a problem at the graduate level, where you're trying to generate new knowledge instead of merely regurgitating basic facts. So I think an important principle in using LLMs well is to use them critically as a tool (similar to Google search or Wikipedia) to gather information rather than relying on it to do your argumentation and writing for you. Don't ever do things like cite a book or paper that you've never read just because an LLM summarized it for you - read it yourself. Don't just feed some simple prompt (""improve my research idea for me"") and copy the output into your final submission. Learn how to make clever, targeted prompts whose output can assist in further research and writing rather than make the final product itself. Ask the LLM to cite its sources each time, so you can check yourself whether what it says is correct. I don't think any of this is ""cheating,"" anymore than reading Wikipedia to further your knowledge is cheating. But it is important to develop good intellectual habits that serve you well in the long term as a developing scholar. When you're defending your thesis or talking with other scholars in your field, you have to speak thoughtfully and knowledgeably to people in real time without the help of an LLM. Make sure that your LLM use is not hindering your development in that regard",Academic,High,2.0,web:pullpush:r/academia:comment:problem,High,2,2439,421,0,"My guess is a lot of people here are older humanities academics who feel really threatened with the rise of ChatGPT, especially as it has gotten better overtime at both summarizing knowledge with less hallucinations and",0

"This is an automated service intended to preserve the original text of the post. *Hello, I'm a 4th-year undergrad student in a Bachelor of Social Work program. This year is my Field Placement year, so I'm working an internship 8 hours a day, Monday-Thursday, which is required for my degree. I lucked out on my other classes, I have our hybrid seminar every other Friday and my other two classes are fully online and asynchronous. The problem lies with one of those asynchronous classes. I've met with the professor on a few occasions and she's very kind and laid back, very open to questions and accommodating, but some of her deadlines make no sense. Multiple time's she's set a deadline for the middle of a random weekday, for example there's one assignment coming up in a couple weeks that's due on a Wednesday at 4pm. My placement hours are 8:30-4:30, which is quite common, most of us in our placements work 8 hours (usually 9-5 or equivalent). So, the deadline for me and any other placement student is essentially the Tuesday before by default, unless we're willing to take a late mark which I'd like to avoid if possible. It's happened before, I got slammed by a late mark because I didn't realize an assignment was due by 4pm or something, I'm so used to them being due by the end of the day/midnight. That's on me for not checking, so I just delt with it, but I still find it odd. Is she trying to keep us on our toes? It feels like there's more fair ways to do that. For context, this is a 4th-year course and the professor has verbally acknowledged her awareness of our placements multiple times. Abd yet she still turns around and sets a deadline for a time that's virtually impossible to meet the day of. I know it's not a bad thing and even encouraged to submit assignments early, I just wonder why not just set the deadline to the night before? If you're not even giving us the full day as extra time anyway? Most of us are going to have to turn it in by the night before anyways. Would it be rude to politely question her about this via email? TL;DR My professor often sets very awkward deadlines in the middle of the day, making it hard to use the extra time given and essentially forcing a lot of us who work during the day to submit it the day/night before. It's becoming confusing and I want to ask her about her reasoning for this but I worry it might come off as rude.* *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Hardly any multiple choice tests are released to students to study from. My calc teacher makes new tests and quizzes EVERY YEAR 3. In order to gain access to questions, students must buy books CREATED by the college board so they make money 4. The president of the college board, a non profit organization, made 1.3 MILLION in 2009. Over twice sal khan's salary at khan academy and more than the Red Cross president salary. 5. For having a monopoly over financial aid and testing products 6. For having to pay $12 PER COLLEGE to sent scores. To send a number 7. To have to pay $16 PER COLLEGE to send a financial aid report (the irony). Meanwhile the FAFSA is completely free 8. Paying 19 executives over $300,000 a year from student money 9. For having multiple reporting errors in their [process](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/eqbkfe/fuck_the_college_board/) 10. Having to pay $98 dollars to go through an AP exam (3 hours of death) 11. In addition to these $98, students have to pay for study materials due to lack of resources posted online 12. For playing mind games with students (you can send your score to 4 colleges for free before you get your score report or pay to send to colleges after you get your scores? What?) 13. For selling student data [College Board Search — Pricing and Payment Policies](https://collegeboardsearch.collegeboard.org/pastudentsrch/support/licensing/pricing-payment-policies) without making them sufficiently aware [The College Board's Student Privacy Pledge Status – Pledge to Parents &amp; Students](https://studentprivacypledge.org/the-college-boards-student-privacy-pledge-status/) 14. Recycling SAT exams allowing for cheating 15. Rush shipping is an extra $15.

"I'm a freshman, and I feel like the grade curve is a bit unfair, what should I do. We recently had an algebra 2 test that the class did not do very well on. My friend and I both got the high which is a 98.4, average was around a 65, the lowest score was only a 24.4, and no one got 100%, the highest was only 98.4. Our teacher got very frustrated with the scores, and he said that in his 13 years of teaching, he has never gotten such a low average, and he said he didnt understand what he did wrong, as he taught the same things with the same test he did for the past years. He told us that he was very frustrated when inputting the test grades, and that he slept at 2 am and woke up at 5 am thinking about it. With 36/101 students failing, most of them didn’t get 58 and 59, most of them got like 34 percent. He originally did not say anything about curving the grade. However, as more students and parents emailed him about their bad test scores, he sent out this email: “First, I know several students and family members have sent me emails with questions and concerns. Please know I am not ignoring those emails you sent, and appreciate you reaching out. This whole situation has weighed heavily on me, and I have needed some time to really process the situation. The scores are due to many things. A few reasons include lack of following directions, lack of work shown, and lack of knowledge. I also feel I missed something in preparing students for this test. I know each year is different, but there has never been an average below 85% on this particular test, so 65% really shocked me. Some other statistics for you. The median is around 70%, so half are above and half below. Typically, the median is around 87% for any given test. Lastly, just over 1/3 of the students did not pass the test. That is a lot, I am well aware, and has affected me immensely. I have been trying to digest all this information myself and deciding what is going to be best for the students, the grades, myself, and families. Those who have reached out asked questions about extra credit, retakes, curving, etc. In my thirteen years of teaching this course, there has never been a test with statistics such as this one. So. What I believe is going to be the best for everyone moving forward is to square root curve the test scores as this will benefit everyone. That being said, this is going to be a one-time occurrence. I am hoping that everyone, myself included, will use this as a learning opportunity to make adjustments moving forward. You will all be getting a square root curve. What does this mean? How does this work? Here is an example. Score: 70% Square root the decimal: √.7 = 0.837 Multiply by 100 for new score: 83.7%” The problem with this email is that the way the curve works is that more lower one scores, the higher the curve they get. My friend and I got the highest score, so with this square root curve, we can only get around a 99.1, barely even 0.8 points increase. However, if a person got a 50%, their grade would increase to a 70%, which is 20% more than before. We think that this is unfair, as we were the ones who focused and worked hard to get a good grade on this test, while they automatically just got so much higher curves than us, and we didn’t even get more than a 0.8% curve. We want to convey to our teacher in a friendly way so that he won’t take anything against us/won’t take any offense to us telling him about this situation, because we also have another test in two days and don’t want to make a bad impression so that he will not grade our test more harshly. We want to ask him to make our grade higher in a good way because we really do think it is unfair.

We interact rarely, but every time I get this kind of treatment,It's as if every comment he makes is a some ""beef"". This professor is shy, or socially awkward, I don't know. He sometimes starts teasing me one moment, makes weird sarcastic comments the next, and then switches to being rude and cold. One day I was learning a new program and he said “how many buttons are there, huh?” with obvious sarcasm,hinting that I'm stupid and don't understand anything. And there were many comments of this type on various occasions. There was a time when I was laughing and he said “stop spitting here.” Or when I asked him to help, he said, “Are you going to plan my time?” He almost always smiles or giggles when he says these things. One day I asked him “why are you bullying me?”, he turned away, started giggling and replied “I’m not bullying you. Just a little.”. Another professor, his friend, once witnessed this and said, “why are you so rude to her? What did she do?”,but that professor dont answer anything to his friend. That day was full of strange comments from him, so I just go home and cry for several hours. My friends noticed his behavior too, calling it a ""weird dynamic."" I'm the only one he treats like that, as far as I know. And he certainly wasn’t like this half a year ago. Always when we interact such strange things happen, but the rest of the time he ignores me.

"Canadian P.Eng, PhD here. If you want to work in a University rather than a college (if you know the difference in Canada, you know the difference) you will have to have a PhD. To be a prof at an accredited engineering department you will need both a PENG and a PhD. i did an undergrad in Engineering with Summer research (both in academic and industry) every summer. I did a 16 month co-op placement at a now-defunct telecom (that was fun), and then went to grad school in Canada. This means one of two things - a Masters + PhD (my route) = 6 years. Or admission to a Masters program with a transfer to a PhD (possibly faster, but in reality often 6+ years anyway). During my graduate school work I was paid enough not to go into debt and to save a little bit (enough that I had 20K to my name when I graduated). Payment was through multiple sources, at first it was a graduate research assistant position in the lab of my supervisor and a TA-ship. Later it was a provincial scholarship + TA-ship, finally it was an NSERC. While doing my graduate training, I identified and maintained contact with a P.Eng (who I put on my committee) and asked them fill out the form attesting to the maximum number of engineering hours I could get. Then I went to do a post doc. I did three years of a postdoc in an academic environment (careful to identify an engineering supervisor and collect my hours) and wrote my engineering ethics exam. During my postdoc I focused on research and getting manuscripts out, and tried my hand at writing grants, but was largely unsuccessful. I started applying to faculty jobs. I got a couple of interviews, but it was pretty clear that I was just being interviewed because of my gender, to say they had brought someone in, Finally, with no success on the job market, I took a job in the US doing research and development with a company in my field. I ended up really refining my ability to write concisely and describe my technical projects at this job which served me really well. I received my PEng from the province I last lived in and started applying for faculty jobs after two years in the states, not because I was unhappy with, but I was ready to come back to Canada - just about anywhere in Canada. With my BA (been abroad), I started getting interviews that were a good fit (Canadian universities have dumb blinders on - so do SOME of your training somewhere that isn't Canada -- like the UK or France since the US isn't really a good option right now). After 4 years total in the US, I moved back to Canada with a tenure track job. Based on the writing skills I learned in the States, I've been quite successful in getting grants and building a research program. Some things to note: Looking at my first set of faculty applications, my research program was -- lacking. I didn't know what I wanted to do and it showed in my writing. My route took 17 years. 5 years of undergrad (4+coop), 6 years of grad school, 2 years of postdoc, and 4 years of industry experience.

"How do I bring up concerns to my advisor. I apologize for the long post, but I need some advice about how to approach my advisor about my frustrations and worries. Here is all the necessary background information: 1. I want to graduate this semester. 2. I would like to be further along on my thesis than I currently am, but I was not able to work as much on it during the summer because my advisor wanted me to analyze samples THAT I AM NOT EVEN USING FOR MY THESIS. He kept saying I would get help running these samples (seek out undergrads willing to volunteer, hire an undergrad for the lab, he himself would come in and help, etc.), BUT I NEVER GOT HELP. While I was analyzing these samples, he kept telling me I should be working more on my thesis. I kept reminding him that he wanted these samples analyzed which would just prompt him telling me I would get help soon, so then I'd be able to really focus on my thesis. AGAIN THE HELP NEVER CAME. 3. My advisor is overall a good advisor. He has generally been available when I need help, but it seems that when it really counts, he falls short. When I was writing my thesis proposal, he kept dragging his feet on giving me edits. He procrastinated so much that I had to send out my proposal a week later than I said I would to the rest of my committee. Another time, I was applying for additional funding through my university, and I wanted to apply as soon as the application system portal opened because it was a first come first served kind of thing. Basically, as long as a proposal was decent, it would get funding, but once the money runs out, it runs out. I sent him my proposal to get his suggestions, and he told me he would look at it a few days before the application system portal opened. He did not. I contacted him the day before it opened to see what was up. He said he would get to it the next day. He didn't. Then he said he would get to it the next day. He didn't. This went on and on, and I ended up submitting my proposal 5 days after the initial system portal opened. Luckily, I still ended up getting funding, but I was so frustrated because he knew it was important to get applications in early. I've also asked him to look over my application materials for two of the jobs I've applied for because I obviously would want his suggestions to make my resume and cover letters as strong as they can be. The first one, he was timely, but the second time, he dragged his feet. I told him the day I wanted to apply by, but he didn't look at it until a couple days later. I messaged him before I applied to give him another chance, but he never responded. He then was shocked to find out I applied when he hadn't looked at it yet because the posting wasn't closed yet. This really irked me because he didn't do what he said he would, and was not communicative when he couldn't hold up his promise. 4. My advisor keeps trying to add additional things to incorporate into my thesis. I know he's just excited because the stuff I'm finding is very interesting, but now is not the time. We are already in a time crunch. Literally all of my other committee members have agreed that my project is more than enough for a masters thesis. I do not need to add more. So now my big concern is that he is going to drag his feet once again when it comes to giving me thesis edits. I am not completely done with my draft, but I have my intro, methods, and most of my results done. I told him two weeks ago that I had my intro and methods done, so he can look at it whenever he has time. He hasn't looked at it of course. I am getting worried because I don't have a lot of buffer room timewise. He is aware of this and assured me he'd be on top of things because I'm his only grad student right now. It doesn't seem like he's on top of it. How can I confront him about these concerns without coming off as rude or entitled? I know he has other responsibilities, and I'm not entitled to all of his time. It's just if I am to submit all the stuff I need to submit on time, he needs to do what he needs to do in a timely manner. From past instances, I am feeling like I can't really count on him. I am kind of kicking myself because I should have just told him I wasn't going to run those samples unless extra help was lined up. I kept believing him when he said I was going to get help soon. I also need advice on how to tell him no about adding additional things to my thesis. He has a way of making me feel like I'm not doing enough even though I am doing more than I should be. TLDR: My advisor is unreliable when it really counts, and I need to confront him about it without coming off as rude or entitled to his time. I apologize for any typos or grammar mistakes.

"How are student clubs doing at your institution. We have a student-led club at our institution which focuses on discipline-specific topics, events, community engagement, and activities. The discipline relates to animals, so the events, activities, discussions, etc. are pretty exciting and interesting! Over the past 5 years, engagement and attendance continues to drop to the point that I (faculty advisor) and the current (graduating) president of the club are strongly thinking we need to just stop the club. The situation is a bit more lengthy including the lack of engagement causing the president to take on all the roles because members have no interest in supporting the club, as well as some of the events ask for extensive help from some of the staff in our department. In other words, the benefits do not seem to outweigh the costs. Over the past few years, the current/outgoing president and I have tried implementing new and exciting activities and events (making enrichment for our Ambassador Animals, visiting zoos, etc). Although we get some folks to attend, no one helps the president set up or clean up.

"I’m scared of the cost of college and I think I’ve ruined my life. Basically, I worked tirelessly in high school because I was told that’s what you have to do to get scholarships. Graduated with a 4.0, took most difficult classes, had lots of awards and achievements, had no social life. As I was applying to schools, my parents couldn’t help because they didn’t know anything and my HS counselor didn’t have time to help me. It was awful. I got into to some really good school though. Now the real problem… money I ended up going to a school in association with one of the really good schools I got into that costs way less BUT STILL TOOOOOO MUCH I’m paying $30,000 a year and even if I went in state, (which I got scholarships for) it still would’ve been around $28,000 a year! My parents cannot help me at all but they make too much for me to get much from FAFSA. I’ve applied to hundreds of scholarships to no avail. The college admissions office said they can’t help me and just give me papers on scholarships I’ve already done. Everyone is telling me not to get loans but I don’t know what else to do.

So far, I’ve gotten into the 3 schools in the title, each direct admit to the finance programs. Here are the scholarships I have received and final costs per year for each school OSU Fischer-13,500 given, about 38k/year OOS IU Kelley- 8000 given, about 55k/year OOS CU Boulder- 7000 given, about 13.5k/year without dorm, but I am planning to stay in dorm first year, so first year will be around 33k, then 13.5k for the rest of the years My goal is to do investment banking in the future. I know that Kelley has the best placement into NYC and Chicago. However, there is still Charles Schwab in Colorado, which hires from CU Leeds. I am worried that I won’t get into the IU workshop.

Final exam was full of mistakes and we were forbidden from asking any questions whatsoever. There was content prof explicitly said would not be covered.

"Major in Computer Science or Nursing. I am an incoming freshmen who is currently undecided with a guaranteed transfer to any program at my school. My initial path was to go Poli Sci on a Pre-Law Track and then go to law school. I still want to remain on a Pre-Law Track, but as you know law school is okay with any undergraduate major. Recently, I decided to switch to a major which can get me a decently paying job immediately after receiving my bachelors due to the fact that I chose to attend my T-20 dream school, but am now facing about 100k in debt by graduation as a result of a recent change in my parents financial situation. I want to major in Comp Sci or Nursing now. I genuinely have an interest in both, but am conflicted between which of the two to choose. Both give me the option to pay off a portion of my debt before going into law school-- and that's if I even want to go to law school anymore at that point. As Comp Sci does bring in more money, I absolutely struggle in math, I ended Pre-Calc with a C, and I got a B in AP Calc with a 1 on the exam. For context as to what kind of student I am, I have only gotten As on my transcript other than those two classes, showcasing how bad it really was. I know Comp Sci is super math heavy which scares me, but I know that if you put your mind to anything you can figure it out. So, maybe there's hope for me. It gives me the option to possibly make 6 figures, and even around that same amount working from home. Nursing, I originally wanted to be a nurse from 7-9th grade (blame Grey's Anatomy) until I fell in love with Law. I genuinely want to help people and it became even more apparent during the pandemic how much I like the profession. It also gives the option of a 4 day work week, which I love as opposed to 5. Lots of memorization, which I typically have no issue with. Of course has math, but not as extreme of a level as Comp Sci. But, the avg. nurse salary is 85k, meaning I will have less to put towards my loans. I also am just scared that I will choose to stay in the profession, but then it will eventually wear me out. There's a lot of nurse's I've seen through social media that have quit, especially recently, due to the mental drainage of the profession. Let me know what you think, maybe you can read between the lines and see something I'm not seeing myself in terms of where my heart lies. I truly am a fan of both professions, but my math skills are VERY minimal (I got 25\*6 wrong today and my brother in 6th grade got it right before me. I know), and in terms of nursing, I'm scared that It'll be very mentally taxing where I lose love for the profession.

"Need to Decide TODAY: Penn State vs Rutgers vs University of Colorado for Electrical Engineering. Hey everyone — I’m in a bit of a time crunch and could really use your honest input. I have to make my decision today, and I’m torn between Penn State (University Park), Rutgers (New Brunswick), and the University of Colorado Boulder for Electrical Engineering. I’m from New Jersey, but money is not an issue, so cost while a still a factor, won’t be a deciding factor. I’d love any insight you have — whether you’ve attended, know someone who has, or just have an opinion.

"Totally get the need for it to be viable! Start ups typically lose a lot of money at first curating a user base that they then leverage by convincing VCs that it can then be monetized. If you’re fully against removing the paid option just for now, I think considering increasing the limits for the free option, adding a free trial, or making it a one-time payment to start may be better — again, just for now to build a user base, you can raise it later. You can look into adding some non-intrusive ads to potentially cover the costs. Of course, this is second-order to building out the library. I do think starting with journals provides a good use-case and even though they aren’t author-uploaded, the peer-review process should still make them legitimate. You can start with something like *Science* or *Nature* or *Proceedings of the National Academy of Science*, which are general-interest journals so should be more digestible from the get-go.

"Terrible advisor but almost finished. Hi everyone, I'm currently a 5th year PhD student about to finish up my dissertation. I have a postdoctoral position already lined up and ready to go. I am the only graduate student in the lab right now and have been relatively successful in my work. &amp;#x200B; For the past \~3 years my advisor has turned into an extremely negative, emotionally abusive person. He constantly: &amp;#x200B; \- Interrupts people in the middle of their sentence (aside from other PI's), has had several moments where he has shouted at me (and others) for minimal issues (opening the shipping box the printer's toner came in). \-Puts people down or minimizes issues (I have severe anxiety I have to take benzodiazapenes for and while my PI was getting his house remodeled he was spending a lot of money and time getting it done and said ""yeah you think you have anxiety"" - I'm pretty snarky and I replied ""yeah at least yours will end""). \-Is very negative and overreacts about things (when we were writing my manuscript there was a small error on the stats and he said the whole work was ""unpublishable"", which it wasn't because it got published). \-And forces you to accept his opinion, or concede to it (you can't concede begrudgingly or else he'll yell/lecture at you about why he's right), about academically related things (it was nearly impossible to write a review with him because semantics about the interpretation of behavioral assays is pretty subjective). &amp;#x200B; He used to be a lot more accepting, kind, and easy to get along with. I am not sure what changed. I am not the only person to have noticed this. We had a postdoc join our lab for &lt;8 months, only to leave because of personal issues with my PI. His complaints were that he is extremely negative and disrespectful. The lab environment is completely fragmented and there are few positive day to day interactions between the main staff. As far as I know he is not suffering from any health issues or going through a particularly emotionally tumultuous time. He constantly complains about how nobody respects or listens to him. &amp;#x200B; I was wondering if anyone has ever sent their advisor a letter about these concerns and how it could impact the future of the lab?

"That part. I used to think that it was just me, but as I started talking to different colleagues across campus, I was not true. The verbal abuse, being high in class, and threats from parents are all true for everyone. I miss the students from 2016 to 2019 because there were fewer incidents like this. When there were issues, at least students came to office hours or sought help. For example, the same student who tried to get me fired claimed they had no problems writing in college. Then, when asked by my department chair why they did not go to tutoring, the response was, ""I don't need it because I was told I was an excellent writer in high school."" This same student could not write a coherent sentence nor an email complaining about me without using ChatGPT.

The handful of CE related classes I've taken so far were all 100 level so I've been able to keep my head above water, but I am confused about how I should be studying. I take notes during lectures, review slides if they're available online, and participate in study groups. All of the CE classes I've taken had no textbook or equivalent supplemental content. Come exam day/project doc release day and I always feel like I was missing a ton of info. For example, In my intro to computer engineering class (ECE 101) there were topics on the final exam that were never covered in class. I asked the professor afterwards what I should have been doing to be prepared for that and I was told it should've come up when I was studying, and that I must not have studied at all. I don't understand what that means. I got lucky a few times with things that were incidentally covered in Youtube videos on other topics that I did know were going to be on the exam, but I can't imagine this was the intended method of learning the content. All the I've taken exams have left me feeling this way. No luck finding course reserves either, for whatever reason the ECE department at my school has nothing listed at the library at all. I am just really confused as to how I am supposed to know to study topics that aren't covered in class, listed in the syllabus, or anywhere on the LMS.

"The latest trend in campus journalism: hiding offensive facts from readers (or apologizing for them). ***‘We must take active steps to ensure our paper is created responsibly and respectfully’*** What in the world is happening to college newspapers these days? A couple recent incidents suggest that student journalists are internalizing the censorship demanded of them by readers who are easily triggered or simply offended by the basics of journalism. *The Harvard Crimson* has yet to tell readers the content of the jokes that provoked more than 70 members of Harvard’s marching band to [**walk out of its own centennial banquet**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/harvard-is-a-new-puritan-sect-marching-band-walks-out-of-its-own-party-because-of-sexual-harassment-jokes/) earlier this month. This is despite the editorial board’s approval of the walkout in a [**Wednesday editorial**](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/10/23/editorial-bad-jokes/). What we know is that alumni speakers joked about “the necessity of censoring one’s own speech” to comply with the band’s new sexual harassment policy, according to the president of the band’s foundation. The most charitable explanation, which isn’t comforting, is that multiple *Crimson* staffers have not asked people at the banquet what the actual jokes *were*. (I’ve been unable to find video on Facebook or Twitter of the jokes being told or the walkout that followed.) The more troubling possibility is that at least some of the *Crimson* staffers know the rough wording of the jokes but have chosen to keep them from readers, to protect them from “inappropriate and offensive” humor, as the editorial described it. Neither the reporters of the Oct. 17 story nor the editorial board responded to my emails Wednesday night about their knowledge of the jokes’ wording. **MORE**: [**Band freakout over jokes shows ‘Harvard is a new Puritan sect’**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/harvard-is-a-new-puritan-sect-marching-band-walks-out-of-its-own-party-because-of-sexual-harassment-jokes/) At least the *Daily Campus* at the University of Connecticut, which recently arrested students [**under a law that criminalizes “ridicule**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/following-slur-incident-uconn-students-demand-speech-codes-mandatory-hate-crime-course-new-black-hires/),” didn’t hide pertinent facts from readers in an article on a local government official’s resignation. Rather, it apologized to readers last week for *accurately quoting* him. “I hate black people” was the banner on the front-page article, and it’s still on the [**online article**](https://dailycampus.com/stories/2019/10/8/i-hate-black-people-mansfield-town-manager-out-after-racist-comments-hostile-work-environmentnbsp). The quote is taken directly from the [**letter**](https://www.scribd.com/document/419488622/Kennedy-Document) chronicling Mansfield Town Manager Derrik Kennedy’s racially charged office conduct, which led him to resign this summer. (The campus newspaper covers local government as well as UConn.) The subhead makes clear the context: “Mansfield town manager fired after racist comments.” It’s hard to imagine any newspaper putting a different combination of headline and subhead on such an article, especially the printed front page. It couldn’t be better to draw in readers. And the editorial board couldn’t have groveled any more thoroughly. “We have heard from UConn community members that the headline caused undue distress,” reads an [**editorial**](https://dailycampus.com/stories/2019/10/14/an-apology-for-last-weeks-headline) from the *Daily Campus* last week apologizing for its newsgathering ways: &gt;The Daily Campus realizes we could have conveyed the main information of the story just as effectively without the unnecessary shock value of the quotation being such a prominent element of the headline. … We have already had conversations with our entire staff about why this headline was inappropriate. We have encouraged our staff to readily engage in a conversation about sensitive topics in the stories we report in the future. The Daily Campus is aware of the impact our content has on the UConn community. With that, we must take active steps to ensure our paper is created responsibly and respectfully. **MORE**: [**UConn students demand speech codes, mandatory hate crimes course**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/following-slur-incident-uconn-students-demand-speech-codes-mandatory-hate-crime-course-new-black-hires/) In other words, it’s promising to bury the most newsworthy part of the story from readers who are less likely than ever to read more than the headline. That’s not only bad journalism, but also a recipe for losing readers. You can tell readers all you want that someone made “racist comments.” But without specifying what he said – “I hate black people” – you are essentially patronizing readers, telling them they can’t handle the truth. I’m starting to wonder if college journalism is approaching an inflection point similar to when students started demanding more censorship than their administrators were dishing out. That’s generally traced to the [**second term of the Obama administration**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/when-empathy-shuts-down-debate-a-review-of-freedom-from-speech/). College media boosters have long sounded the alarm about administrators suppressing coverage that [**puts the school in a bad light**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/university-employees-steal-bundles-of-campus-newspaper-to-stop-bad-publicity-on-welcome-day/) or simply [**creates tension on campus**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/it-mocked-safe-spaces-the-university-defunded-it-an-appeals-court-just-reinstated-its-lawsuit/). Sometimes this involves [**professional threats to faculty advisors**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/community-college-gets-away-with-retaliating-against-student-journalists-and-faculty-adviser/) for campus newspapers. It’s the driving factor behind so-called [**New Voices legislation in several states**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/republican-led-arkansas-approves-even-more-protections-for-student-journalists/), which seeks to protect the rights of student journalists to control what they publish. Then Wesleyan University’s student government [**threatened to defund**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/post/26850/) its newspaper because of a column critical of Black Lives Matter, which helped spark the [**#SaveStudentNewsrooms movement**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/censorship-threats-financial-challenges-drive-student-journalists-to-savestudentnewsrooms/). **MORE**: [**Wesleyan paper loses funding (again) for column critical of Black Lives Matter**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/student-newspaper-loses-funding-running-op-ed-critical-black-lives-matter/) Funding threats from student government leaders, who cower in fear before student activists with bottomless demands for justice, can’t necessarily be fixed by legislation. And the constant pressure on campus newspapers to tread lightly on the delicate sensibilities of student activists seems to be having an effect on their editorial choices. So to summarize: *The Crimson* won’t actually tell you the jokes that made more than 70 band members walk out of their own centennial. Who knows if they even asked reliable sources what the jokes were. (For the moment, *The Crimson* is standing up to activists who [**demand it not interview**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/harvard-immigration-activists-furious-that-student-newspaper-asked-ice-for-comment/)immigration officials.) *The Daily Campus* practically goes to confession after telling readers *the most important quote from the subject of its coverage.* All because some readers complained it was “insensitive.” I have no idea who the hell is going to defend campus journalism if the journalists themselves refuse to do their jobs. from [https://www.thecollegefix.com/the-latest-trend-in-campus-journalism-hiding-offensive-facts-from-readers-or-apologizing-for-them/](https://www.thecollegefix.com/the-latest-trend-in-campus-journalism-hiding-offensive-facts-from-readers-or-apologizing-for-them/)",Faculty,High,2.0,reddit:r/university,High,2,8131,933,6,The latest trend in campus journalism: hiding offensive facts from readers (or apologizing for them).,0

"If you had the option would you A) move out of parents house, or B) study abroad for a semester or two. So i finally got a permanent job after only having seasonal jobs here and there, and one of my goals is to save enough money to either move out and get my own apartment with friends or study abroad to Spain preferably. I’ve had your stereotypical helicopter parents, there’s so many things that my parents fucked up by trying to “make me better,” so I think independence would really allow me to grow into my own person and finally have some confidence and freedom. I’ve commuted and lived at home all my years of college so far so I’m kind of chasing that college experience. Now if I were to move out in an apartment it would only be 15-20 min away and I feel like they would still have some say over what I’d do and maybe it’s not enough distance. The plus here is that I’d finally be able to cultivate my life, and just really set my own path. If I were to study abroad then I feel like the sky’s the limit, but the only thing that is scary is the uncertainty. What if I end up going all this way to some foreign country and it’s not why I thought, what if I get lonely over there since I’d be leaving the people I know, and it’s just more of a leap.

"“Is XXX worth it?” questions are meaningless because value or worth isn’t the same person to person. So you need to judge that yourself. You can look up average comp, and it would depend on what you do after vet school (specialist or generalist, private practice vs someone else’s practice, etc.). Your best path would be to talk to actual practicing vets, or even to get some hands on experience volunteering at places with animals like a vet, wildlife rescue, farm, etc. One of the complaints you’ll sometimes hear from traditional vets is that at its core you’re still dealing alot with the owners who are people, and who don’t always prioritize their animals the same way… that may or may not be an issue for you but it’s something to be aware of. The good news is that since veterinary school is a graduate program, you’ll do your undergrad in some other degree sort of like pre-med - often flavors of biology or animal science - which gives you a lot of time to learn more or get experience before deciding whether to go to vet grad school. There’s some advantage to going to a school with a vet school since you’ll be close to vet students, but it’s not required - some examples of the good schools that also have vet grad programs I know are Cornell, UC Davis, UIUC, Tufts, Oregon State, and Ohio State.

"Thesis approach too similar to earlier work. An earlier great masters thesis inspired me and I would love to follow similar approach in mine to study a different group, but I'm afraid of ending up plagiarising the original. How would you recommend me to approach this? Basically, an earlier student wrote a great masters thesis where they built upon recently published findings on demographic X, which I chanced upon. In addition to replicating some of the regressions used in the original published article on a new dataset, they took the suggested but untested explanation for the results and ran empirical tests used in 2-3 other very well known studies on it. The thesis was overall well researched, the logic behind the hypotheses was solid and in general it really impressed me, although it was mostly just copying methods of earlier fundamental works on less researched niche. Pondering on it, I realised that in an unrelated demographic Y, I would expect to find exactly opposite patterns. Just for illustrative purposes, lets say we are talking about female and ex-convict performance in higher education and placement into workplaces. I have personal interest in the other demographic and would love to explore it in my thesis, but this would lead our studies having close resemblence. Unfortunately, I was an idiot and ran the topic and the results I would expect by my advisor without mentioning the original thesis, and they agreed that it sounded like a good topic before this whole Corona mess. The more I try to work on this idea, the more I realise that I am just too close to comfort with the original thesis. Majority of the general literature I would cover, which does not relate to specific demographics, would be the same core findings in this field. Our statistical tests would for the most part (~75%) be identical and based on the same 3-4 studies, although we would be testing different demographics. We would also share the same dataset as a source, as it is the only one available for us. There are few very minor areas where I can expand on the study, both by more slightly more robust methods and by looking at things relevant only to my group. Of course, all the test results, their intepretation and discussion would be different. However, I don't feel that this is enough to justify the topic. Running parts of my research plan draft on turnitin suggests 10% similarity to the earlier work, clear indication of lack originality. At the same time, I ran some initial statistical analysis, and I am finding extremely high significance across measures which is making me reluctant to drop this topic and begin anew - which is also difficult from time perspective.

"Unpopular opinion: Going to college undecided is not okay. I think I speak for only a small number of people when I say I believe that going to college undecided is *not* okay. Consider the modern job market and the most common complaints people have about it: Low skill jobs, or jobs that are incredibly specialized that require multiple years of experience. Ye olde chicken and egg problem revamped for the 21st century job market. The solution, however, is very very simple. Get internships. They're real, practical work experience that will get you (ideally) good standing with a company, and the specialized skills you need in the evolving job market. Generally, people take internships at various times, but usually sometime around their junior year. Please don't comment with ""but my twice removed grandcousin did an internship his/her sophomore year."" I'm glad your cousin is special. I do not care. I am referring to the average person who doesn't come into college undecided. But what happens when you go into college undecided? The reality is you make yourself less competitive for internships in the future. You will have spent a year or possibly more in college and will need to spend another year doing major specific classes in order to qualify for an internship in 90% of cases. In the other 10% of cases you'll need more. These internships are what make your degree helpful in the future. Paper in and of itself is no longer the qualifier for jobs anymore. You've now left yourself with very little time compared to other candidates who may be on their second or third internship summer of senior year, while you're on your first or second - or worse, zeroth (if that's even a word).\\ The best answer to this problem? Go into a major that you think you'll like. If it doesn't work out, you're in the same position you were as undecided with maybe 2-4 extra credits in a specific major. If it *DOES* work out, congratulations!

"What is the best way to explain my current academic situation to my professors. Hello! I am a 2nd year engineering student and need some help communicating with professors. For context, I was diagnosed with OCD a few years ago, but I started on medication and it hadn’t really been too much of an issue since. Unfortunately, this quarter has been really tough, and for some reason this quarter it has gotten really bad and severely impacted my academics (and life in general). I am really struggling with how to talk to my professors about everything because I know that from their perspective it looks like I just don’t care. My college has small class sizes, so professors notice when you miss class and because of everything I’ve missed classes a few times. Additionally, I complete all the homework assignments, but I usually can’t turn them in because they don’t feel “right” (I know that sounds ridiculous but I don’t know how to explain it any better). I know that, from my professors’ perspective, it looks like I’m not even trying but the reality is I spend almost all of my time either in class or doing homework (I also get stuck for hours rewriting/redrawing and checking homework). I’m currently working with the counseling center at my school to managing my OCD but that will take some time and I need to work out my academic situation now. I know I need to explain everything, but I’m struggling to figure out how to explain clearly. I’m also worried that they might not fully understand what OCD is and think I’m just making excuses. So, what is the best way to approach this conversation? How can I explain what’s been happening in a way that’s clear and helps them understand but, without sounding like I’m just trying to get out of trouble? I know that this is my fault and I’m not expecting any credit from all the homework’s I didn’t turn in, but would it be good for me to bring them in so they know I’m not lying? Any advice on what to say (or avoid saying) would be really helpful. Also is this a conversation to have in person? I can definitely do that but I tend to get anxious when talking to professors one on one (especially in a situation like this) so would it be ok if I wrote down what I was going to say before or is that rude? Sorry for the long post, I really struggle with explaining everything, but thank you for the help! tl;dr: I’m an engineering student currently dealing with a severe OCD flare up, which has led to missed classes and being unable to turn in completed homework. Which has lead to less than stellar performance in my classes, and I need help figuring out how to explain everything to my professors.

"Student is leaving the lab. I just need to rant a bit. Hello all, I am a PhD candidate in natural sciences. I obtained a paid fellowship for an undergraduate to complete in the lab for 2 academic semesters - this is the student's last semester on that paid fellowship. While I was away, this student emailed me asking if they could work in another lab. From that email it sounded like my advisor okayed the idea so I said ""yes"". Email for reference: ""I already cleared this with \[our PI\], but because I made a commitment to your experiment, I wanted to run this by you too. I was wondering if it would be possible to move my fellowship hours to \[other lab\]. I know you are \[away\] this week so this transfer will not happen this week. And if there is anything that you absolutely need help with within the experiment, I could keep an hour here if you need me too. I just want you to know that it is totally understandable if you need me to stay to help with the experiment, but I thought that it does not hurt to ask."" When I returned I started thinking about the funds that we obtained for this student and if it could be given to another student in this lab so I asked advisor if that's possible. They said no and they asked if I realized that this student in question has a commitment to me. I did, but I had already told them that they could move on to the other lab. A couple of days later, I emailed the student that I was confused by their first email and I need her help for the next \~2 weeks. She said she had already started an experiment in the new lab and cannot help that week. I think I casually asked if she could help the next week and she just sent an email to clarify if she should help next week. I did not renege with the initial agreement and I told her that she does not need to help this week at all - I don't really want her here. It feels awful. I got funding for this student and now they are leaving. I didn't receive any complaints from them about me or the lab. Also I really wish I re-read an email, but even if I did I wouldn't want someone that doesn't want to be working on my experiments to work on my experiments. I rather a person who is engaged in the research to volunteer. I am bothered that this funding I have obtained (albeit small) is now been given to a student doing work in another lab.

"Physics, Biology: Dilemma on whether I should switch my major ft. mental health. TLDR is at the bottom as well as my questions. This turned out very long, I apologize. To start out i would like to say this: I love physics, ever since i was in elementary school i've loved physics phenomena, lasers, optics and had marvelled at the fact that we can explain so much about the universe. I took physics as one of my Leistungskurse (elevated courses with more hours in German high schools), did my hs graduation exam in it and finished with an excellent score. I really did enjoy it all the way and our teacher was super chill and supportive, in general all my physics teachers were very cool and made our lessons fun with many very interesting experiments. It's a language that we can explore the universe in and that makes it very exciting. So it's no wonder i went into university pretty determined on physics, however i didn't make my decision based on one specific job i wanted to do, but coming from a thirst for knowledge. In high school, my strategy was to pay attention in lessons and thoroughly write everything down and take notes. I wasn't the kid that caught up to everything the teacher said in the lesson and when preparing for exams or revising I would sit and go through everything by myself. This was a very good method for me personally because i could understand the concepts and their connections in my own pace and understand things through my own methods. It might sound weird that the kid who was regarded as one of the top students sometimes couldn't have answered the most simple questions on a new topic, but that's how it was, i just needed the time. But ever since the bridge courses before the semester i've been struggling. I'm told that it's normal for first years to feel like everyone around you knows everything and only you are behind, but after a semester the feeling is still strongly there. I will admit I have made many mistakes, like starting the more in-depth math courses from the beginning and not revising after every other class. As the workload was immense, I barely slept in the first two months. This in turn lead to me barely being able to stay awake in class and tutorials. I acknowledge these mistakes and have already made adjustments to lighten the load. Now, as for uni, the sheer amount of stuff we have to learn, on our own, at my university -which might be a normal amount, given this is university- is a lot to approach with my method. We were advised to study in groups and do our weekly exercise sheets together, and though I had some moments of victory where I could do one exercise, mostly it consisted of the other students talking about the topic like they understood it really well while I sat there and listened for any coherent crumbs of info and sometimes asked for a tip on how to proceed. Admittedly this was not a good method and I found some people closer to my pace who I could study with, but they weren't always there or we ended up sitting with our sheets well into dusk. So by the time I got home I was tired and turned to my phone for an escape lot of the time. Now I know that delaying catching up with our topics is a bad strategy due to time and the amount of material. But it seems like it's good if i take the time to catch up and revise by myself, also because the way things are explained in class don't always work for me. As for the social aspect of it, there wasn't really a time where I felt that I fit in or that I have much in common with anyone there except maybe when we were talking about art. I also found myself rethinking my choices a lot. I missed my friends and my family immensely and honestly struggled to feel human at times. I haven't really been able to find the motivation to study beyond the desire to get through another week. When I look into what kind of scripts belong to classes in later semesters, the topics seem interesting, still it's pages of text with about the same amount of equations which i'm sure contain so much interesting and informative stuff. Still right now that aspect of ""woah that's so cool"" is kind of missing. Maybe that will come later, i figure when we get to more stuff that's beyond mechanics. I suspect I might also have ADHD and may be nd in other ways which i will get checked out with a professional if i am able to. So to be clear i'm not self diagnosing, but i'm constantly reading up on these subjects and honestly everything seems to make so much more sense. So that's a little bit on how I have felt about my first semester of physics. The thing is, beside physics, I'm also very interested in biology. Our university has a small biology faculty and it seems to be much cozier than 200-300 people in physics. The longer i've thought about it, the more i find myself interested in life and the parts of science that deal with living things. I took biology as a Basiskurs (a course that has less lessons and is more simplified compared to Leistungskurs) and I loved it. At school i've done several presentations in both physics and biology (and ethics) and I loved doing those, I find it's so much fun to research things and share them with others in a way that's engaging and comprehensive. I watch science videos and listen to podcasts in my free time as well, like Scishow (both vids and podcasts) and books like The Selfish Gene (that i found super interesting and recommend!), and generally beside physics, a lot of them have a lot to do with biology. I find that these pieces of media don't overwhelm me and i want to know more about them, in general all kinds of stuff that have to do with life feel like tangible things to me and they kind of fall into place in the big scheme of things. I hope i phrased that in a way that's understandable. I will implement new strategies in the coming semester and am in the process of hopefully getting a private tutor. I'm determined to go through my second semester in physics and reevaluate things after, but the way things are looking for me mentally right now, i think going with something that is naturally and directly engaging and has a sense of novelty and many little rewards that are directly applicable (so: biology) would lighten the load for now. Going into uni i talked with some advisors from both faculties on doing two bachelors, they said it was possible but i should rather wait. I would even consider doing them one after another with no overlap (of course i'd have to start working a job too eventually, to afford rent and basic expenses, right now i have a very amazing scholarship and mainly my parent's support paying for that) The direction that would unite like, almost if not all of my interests well (given my current level of being informed) would be neuroscience. I think it's just in the sweet spot between big stuff and small stuff -ie. humans between particles and the universe and it has that direct application to life that i'm looking for as well as physics and biology. My dad is a surgeon and he has inspired me a lot to look into things that have to do with humans and with medicine, and when we learned about the brain in bio in hs i was always like ""heh i can't wait to learn more about this"". So far it's been the most definite career that i could see myself pursuing in the area of science. I want to help people and i want to feel like i am needed. I still wish to pursue physics, because i love it after all and I Want To Understand Those Things!(tm) also the experience and learned methods are definitely very valuable and give good prospects. I know it will remain a passion. But maybe it could be better to do it when I have the resources, support system that i also have control over, and maturity to do so. TLDR: first semester of physics was a lot to handle partly because of inexperience and partly because it's A Lot, took a toll on me mentally. Implementing new and improved strategy for second semester, will see how things turn out. However, also want to do biology at one point, maybe doing it earlier would benefit my mental wellbeing more? Would love to combine both in future job, not sure of the road to there though. Question to you: Have you had any experiences like this? Is it worth it to keep pushing? Will things change? Also: if you have experience starting out in physics and then going into biology later (maybe even not from a bachelors, like from a masters with overlap in bio or a job) how is that road? Thank you kindly if you read this far and if you have any questions i'd gladly answer, I know my points are a little bit all over the place",Academic,Medium,1.0,web:reddit:r/college:search:scholarship delay,Medium,1,8602,1593,0,"Physics, Biology: Dilemma on whether I should switch my major ft.",0

"Are professors allowed to do this. (I’m purposely not going to go into too much detail as I want to stay anonymous) So just for some context I am a computer science major and my professor is accusing me of cheating because my program was more “advanced” than what was asked and we were never taught the concept that I used. It’s a whole process where I have to go to a panel and stuff to defend myself. So to get to the main point of this story, I had an exam in this class and I was doing the exam and it was going well. Then realized that the last question was similar to the “advanced concept” they’re accusing me for, at first I was pretty skeptical about it, but I answered the question as normal. Then I walked out of the exam and started talking to people about the exam, I asked about the last question which was the one I was confused about. They all said they had different questions than me. So then I realized the professor personally created this exam for me just to try to make me get it wrong and use it against me in the panel as evidence. I was looking at the syllabus and we were never taught this concept and she still put it in the exam just for me to fail it. I thought you can only be tested on what’s in the syllabus.

"Not sure where to go with my studies. I started out studying Environmental Science in 2022 at a Canadian school, after attending a specialized art program in high school and found the transition to STEM really difficult. Due to personal circumstances being a victim of abuse at the time, I had to sacrifice my studies entirely and ended up failing most of my classes, dropping the courses. I ended up transferring to a Studio Art program at the same school after leaving the abusive situation I was in, hoping that it would be more familiar compared to my high school program. However, I found it to be too easy and not fulfilling after doing 3 semesters of it, since the school isn’t art focused. I figured that I needed more advanced art education, and applied to/was accepted as a transfer to an institution in America, but due to a financial issue, I had to defer my acceptance. I’m now taking a gap year to exclusively work in the interim but it’s leaving me with a lot to think about. I really miss my original studies - I was planning on getting a co-op placement, and pursuing a career in wildlife conservation. To this day, I’m still unbearably passionate about it but I feel really stuck. I don’t know if I struggled so much due to my circumstances, or if I’m not cut out for STEM in the first place, but I’m scared to attempt it again - and that I’ll be staying where I am, when I want more than anything to move and start over.

"academic misconduct. I am a current second year student and need advice for an assignment I am being told I am currently under investigation for due to academic misconduct. This has never happened before and would GREATLY appreciate any advice as I do have anxiety over this matter and am in split minds about what to do. to clarify, I am not being accused of plagiarism. but rather unauthorised usage of AI. I will show the exact paragraph that my assignment investigation falls under just below. • unauthorised or unacknowleged text manipulation that undermines the integrity of an assessment, including the use of paraphrasing software, generative artificial intelligence or machine translation such that the work submitted cannot be considered wholly the students own. this is considered academic misconduct because it undermines the validity of the work, and provides an undue or unfair advantage over another student who has completed the assessment in line with the requirements I honestly don’t know what to do at the moment. I used AI to help paraphrase certain sentences to create a more sophisticated style of writing however i did not copy and paste but rather used it as a guide. I also (stupidly) asked chatgpt to write my bibliography as I was running out of time and was also quite unwell and just really needed this assignment handed in &amp; finished. That being said, i’m willing to own up to this if need be but I cannot accept being penalised as though i haven’t written my own work. To note, Turnitin has only flagged my work at 2% (again i do not copy and paste ai, i’m not that dumb) so i’m unsure as to why this has been sent to be investigated. I can only assume it’s the professors own doubts coming into the play. I do plan to go see the professor come monday morning, so here’s where i need help. Now, I’ve read some posts on here and there are people who say to be honest about where you have used it and to offer to even do a oral exam right there and then when i go to see him so that he can see i do have extended knowledge about the work. I’ve seen others however, say that ai use cannot be 100% proven and to not be bullied into a “false confession” and to just deny it with absolute finality because an investigation does not mean you’re guilty. So what do you suggest? realistically yes i used it but in such a minor way to just help me as a student. I did not however use it to come up with my essay points or with my writing style. I’d greatly appreciate any advice and if you’re going to be in the comments telling me about how i deserve punishment and you’re one of those academic integrity advocates who like to shit on other people for using ai even if it’s in minor ways then please DO NOT COMMENT.

"Your experience matters more than you think (especially as a student). One thing I see a lot in student communities is people saying, “I don’t have enough experience yet” or “My resume feels empty.” But here’s the truth as a student, you already *do* have experience. Projects, assignments, internships, part-time jobs, volunteering, hackathons, group work, even self-learning… all of it counts. The real challenge isn’t a lack of experience. It’s knowing how to present it clearly. Most resumes fail because they list tasks instead of outcomes, or they’re written the same way for every role. Recruiters and ATS systems don’t look for perfection. They look for clarity and relevance. A clean, well-structured CV that highlights what you’ve *learned*, *built*, and *contributed* can make a huge difference, even early in your career. If you’re struggling to shape your resume or don’t know how to align it with the role you’re applying for, tools like **AI Elevated CV** can help structure your resume, cover letter, and recommendations in a simple, student-friendly way without exaggeration.

"Is anyone else concerned by the dangers of AI detection tools in higher education. I’m a graduate student at the University at Buffalo, and I recently ran into a serious issue with Turnitin’s AI detection tool. One of my assignments was flagged as AI-generated, even though I wrote it myself. There was no feedback explaining what triggered the flag, and now I’m facing an academic integrity investigation that could result in a failing grade. Since then, I’ve learned that this isn’t an isolated case. Several other students in my program have also been flagged, and in at least one instance, a student was reportedly forced to drop a class. The issue seems particularly concerning for students who speak English as a second language or who have learning differences, as the tool may misinterpret certain writing styles as AI-generated. There’s a lot of conversation about the use of AI in academic writing, but far less discussion about the reliability and fairness of the tools being used to detect it. These systems are opaque, and students are often left without any recourse. This raises serious questions about due process, algorithmic bias, and academic equity. A group of us created a petition to raise awareness and ask our university to pause the use of AI detection tools until a fairer system is in place.

"Looking for advice about responding to a student email about a final grade (asking due to illnesses during the semester). Hi all, I came here early this week asking advice on a student email and found myself with another. This is my second year of teaching- my first being in charge of heavy grading and building curriculum- so all of your advice has been very helpful for me so far. I searched the subreddit and didn't find anything similar. I'll try to explain this in brief (TL;DR below): I had a student this semester that was a good student and put in adequate work: turned in assignments, participated in class, and was a good but not standout. They were sick a lot throughout the end of the semester and missed class because of it. I adjusted their attendance grade accordingly and was as supportive and understanding through the process as I could have been. Their final paper was solid, but not amazing, so they got a B. They reached out because their final grade came to an A-, just shy of an A. I round up when it's.5 away, but theirs was over a percentage point off. They wrote that they were in care a few times around the due date of their final paper and I even gave them a short extension to a ""very hard 11:59pm deadline"" to accommodate. They basically asked now that since they participated and put up good grades overall in the semester and ""given the circumstances"" if there's anyway to bump up to an A, about 1.5% percentage points. My guess is that they waited too late to work on their paper and turned in something that was rushed due to their illnesses, especially since they had time to study and put up a good grade on the final exam as well as got some late work submitted within the due date. In the spirit of ""explaining is draining"", I really don't want to go into detail about how I've already accommodated them and adjusted their grade/deadlines and how their paper was only okay (and how an A- is still a great grade), but I feel weird keeping it to ""final grades are already submitted, have a good break"". Thanks in advance, Professors! TL;DR- student reached out after grades were submitted asking to round up.

"This is an automated service intended to preserve the original text of the post. *Hi! I recently wrote an academic dismissal appeal letter. I will cross out personal info, but I am hoping to get constructive criticism on it before I turn it in tomorrow Thank you lovely professors! cheers Dear Members of the Appeal Committee, I am writing to appeal my dismissal from the University ------ with the hopes of reinstatement for the Spring 2025 semester. While this decision was not a surprise, I am saddened that my academic performance turned out this way. In this appeal I hope to take full responsibility, explain the extenuating circumstances that resulted in these grades, and explain how, moving forward, I am capable of bringing my GPA into good academic standing. I thank you all for this opportunity. The past two semesters have been strenuous for both me and my mental health, leading to my academic performance being inadequate. As I was experiencing dangerous symptoms, my goal was always to pursue medical professionals for treatment. However, before I could, I was suddenly found not eligible for my health insurance anymore. Making affording medication and a psychiatrist impossible for me. Being on government health insurance, when I turned 19 I aged out. I then had to go through a very long and tedious process to be insured again. And in June of 2024, I succeeded. Before I was back to being insured, however, I experienced very dire symptoms that left untreated became progressively more serious. Additionally, my first semester at ---- was in the spring of 2024. Transferring halfway through the year unearthed a lot of isolation and made me feel so hopeless I felt like there was no help for me and I couldn’t do anything. My symptoms carried on getting worse until I was finally able to seek treatment. I pursued treatment through the University's health center the moment I could and got diagnoses and medication that improved my symptoms greatly. My medication and treatment took a while to settle and take effect of course. Although I began to improve my attendance and participation in my education when it did. However, it was too late in the semester for me to achieve my academic goals. The isolation I experienced during my first semester caused my mental health to drop to its lowest point. My symptoms, coupled with my own decisions caused the actions that led to my low GPA. Those actions included: episodes of panic multiple times a day to the point where I could not be stabilized, depressive episodes that resulted in not leaving my room for multiple days on end, missing ample amounts of classes, and anxiety-induced insomnia leading to a lack of motivation. I know I cannot go back and change these actions, but in the process of bettering myself, I have learned an incredible amount. For a while, I lacked the motivation to seek out any free resources while I was struggling with no health insurance. Looking back I now acknowledge that this caused not only my grades to suffer more, but also my mental health. That being said, I no longer struggle with this lack of motivation and have found myself with a newfound excitement towards life and my education. Through this, I have learned about many incredible resources at ---- that have helped me curate a plan for myself to continue a healthy mental state as well as reach good academic standing. To reach good academic standing it is my understanding if readmitted I must reach at least a 2.7 GPA. This GPA is similar to the one I received in high school, so I curated a plan similar to the one I enacted back then so I am familiar with how it impacts me as a student. For starters, I want to continue meeting with my psychiatrist every month and have a meeting scheduled for February 4th. In terms of therapy, I have been in contact with ----- Counseling LLC to place me with a specialist there hopefully sometime in the next month. If for some reason this proves to be too expensive, however, I plan to pursue treatment through cheaper online therapy on Better Help. To better my academic standing I have started talking to my academic advisor about a potential medical withdrawal. I have also switched my major from psychology to English. This major switch was due to many factors. I have found myself passionate in English classes and see clearer and more attainable career goals for myself through this major and love the department here at -----. As previously stated, my academic standing was caused by missing a lot of class time due to many factors. Although I no longer struggle with leaving my room, I believe it is important to have outside sources holding me accountable for my attendance as well. For starters, I plan to attend -------- tutoring sessions located in ----- Library on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 4 p.m. to stay on top of what I am learning in the classes I am attending. On Friday afternoons I also have plans to have study dates with my roommate at local cafes to have a fun way to keep the the two of us motivated. My roommate and I have also discussed carpooling to school to hold ourselves more accountable since we would be responsible for another person's attendance. To make sure my plan is working well for me and my grades, I plan to meet with both my academic advisor and a ------ ambassador every month. I want to schedule my first ----- peer listening session for January 29th at 4:00 p.m. In terms of my insurance, in the case that I am suddenly found ineligible again, I have a list of Federally Qualified Health Centers to reach out to if need be. And in the case, my medication stops working, I now have a support system of friends and family that was not previously present here for me at ----- when I first transferred. Additionally, I want to reach out to (My university's disability center) to inquire about any services I am eligible for. I hope that these resources I have mentioned will aid in my return to good academic standing. My academic standing is incredibly important to me, especially here at ----- which offers unique resources that I want to continue using. I want to state that although my academic standing was inadequate over this time frame, I am not a bad student and have the motivation and tools I did not previously achieve my goals. I have attached a letter from my psychiatrist reciting the progress I have made. I have also attached proof of my insurance and when I was found eligible again. I thank you all for your time and understanding, I hope you consider this appeal and this letter of recommendation when making your decision.

"At what point should I talk to someone about ungraded assignments. I understand this is common in college courses and they’re busy, but we have 3 assignments a week, plus a few extras randomly. it’s week 10, so that’s over 30 assignments.

"Replies to emails: to be expected or a luxury. This has been bugging my mind for the past few days and I finally found this subreddit into which I can vent my thoughts. I've recently joined a new university, and my project supervisor put me in contact with another department member for help in an aspect of my work. At first they were very helpful, having a meeting with me and giving me some suggestions for my work. However, they had planned to assist me in an aspect of my work and I gladly agreed. When I sent an email asking when they would like to begin the work, I received no reply for 3 days. The work is time sensitive and I had seen them around the building today at about 17.00, and so I decided to go to their office and just ask them in person what their plans were. When I knocked on their door, they looked visibly irritated by my being there and rudely told me to come in, and then said they hadn't replied to me because they were unsure of their schedule for the following few days and were waiting to hear if they needed to attend a meeting on one of the days I had suggested we meet. I was quite shocked at how visibly bothered they were that I had come to see them and I very quickly apologised, and (after they said the work was nothing difficult, though to me it is very different and new) assured them I did not need their assistance on the day (and hopefully I won't, I do have faith in my own abilities and if not then it is a learning curve). Am I wrong for thinking that a more professional approach would have been to just fire off a quick email letting me know their schedule was unclear, and that i should go ahead with my plans and they'd try and check in on me from time to time (which is what they ended up suggesting anyway)? I understand academics are very busy people, but not replying to emails at all for days when you've offered personal help seems unfair to me.

"Struggling to Find Studies on AI Waitlist Systems. I’m running into trouble finding enough studies for my systematic review on AI prioritisation systems and their impact on ethnic minorities in healthcare. The central question is: Do AI waitlist systems create unfair delays for ethnic minorities? So far, I’ve only come across one relevant paper. I’ve searched Ovid using a combination of AI, waitlist, and ethnicity keywords, limited to 2020 and onwards. Next, I’m planning to try PubMed, Scopus, arXiv, medRxiv, and the Cochrane Library. I’ll also see who’s citing the one paper I found and snowball from there. I’m wondering if I should broaden my inclusion criteria. I could look at studies on AI in waitlists even if they don’t mention ethnicity, or studies on algorithmic bias in healthcare that don’t focus on waitlists. Another option is including studies on ethnic disparities in triage systems, even if AI isn’t involved. But I’m hesitant to expand too much, it feels like I might stray from my core focus, and I know there are other systematic reviews covering these broader areas. Anyone faced something similar? Should I stick to the narrow focus, or loosen the criteria a bit?

"Almost done with my PhD and I feel like the bar keeps getting raised higher and higher. Hello! I'm about to defend in 3 months (yay!) and as part of my last leg of work for my thesis, I am helping another student out with her project. Some feedback I got back from my committee during my comprehensive exams was that the proposed method is ""very complicated"" and ""what's the benefit of using this method?"" The method is something my PI came up with and is a big part of another student's thesis (he's graduating this semester as well). I'm supposed to take his work and make it medium throughput so we can test a bunch of genetic variants using it. Right now it's kind of clunky and not a good fit for our specific goals. After the feedback from my committee, I went to my 1-1 meeting with my PI with a totally different assay (from the literature) that we can use instead of this method. He said it was a bad idea and while I agree with some of his criticisms, I don't see the point of instead using his clunky ass method for the project I'm currently working on. My advisor then goes on to say ""you don't even have to run these experiments; you just need to show that you understand that these methods can be useful for your field in this specific way and craft a plan to apply this method to your problem."" I'm generalizing for brevity/relatability, because ultimately this is an academia situation; I feel like I'm being asked to just pretend this is important and that I'm doing something useful to prove that my PI's ideas and lab mates' work has some kind of application? Just so I can get my degree (my PI said ""I want more"" even though most of my committee was fine with my current work up to this point and me just writing my dissertation for the next few months). Morally it seems so fucked; I feel like I'm defending how someone else's half baked idea could be used to solve ANOTHER person's problem. I also feel like I'm serving as advisor to this other student who's project I'm helping with. It's like the worst of both worlds; I'm not receiving feedback and I'm expected to help others plan their path to graduation. My PI said there was ""plenty"" of research using methods similar to this one for problems like the one I'm working on and to find it, so after looking with no luck I asked the other senior student (who just completed comprehensive exams, mind you) if he knew of any papers on this exact subject (so ANY papers that showed HIS work was useful) and he said ""sheesh I wouldn't even know where to find that"" \-\_\_- anyone with a PhD can understand the level of exhaustion I'm at right now. Seeking advice on how to maneuver through this, maybe what support to ask my committee for, and perhaps just a place to vent about how circuitous and pointless academia can be, especially for someone nearing the end of their PhD.

"How much should you hate your classes. Hello everyone. I am a freshman in college who is majoring in undecided engineering. I feel like I fell in that trap of I liked building things as a kid and I like computers and tech now, so I was planning to maybe go into computer engineering. I am miserable right now in my basic Calculus and physics classes. I study both imo pretty well but I am only successful in Calculus. I am dumb as a rock in physics.

I enjoy writing and more creative endeavors, but I have no idea what stable careers would utilize these skills. I understand that engineering is hard and I'm not suggesting that I think you have to be some physics and math wizard to understand it, but my question is when is ""the grind"" not worth it. Most people I've talked have given the standard ""work harder"" response, but is it worth it working extra hard on subjects I dislike which I am not great at to get a job in a career I am not really passionate about?

"My mom says she will pay for my college if I go to OSU, but I want to leave and go somewhere else. Hi, I'm hoping this is the right subreddit for this as I've never posted before. I'm a high school junior who takes part time (will switch to full time all of senior year) college classes at The Ohio State University. My school partners with OSU and I take college classes there for free on main campus, which is convenient as I live 20 minutes walking from all of my classes and am able to commute easily. I have spent my entire high school experience being sold on the idea of OSU, but the older I get, the more I want to leave. I don't want to go into specifics but I have sort of a rough home life, it's not abusive by any means but my mom and I have a somewhat strained relationship and she exerts a lot of control over me often, so college is a sore spot for our relationship. My parents are divorced, and my dad has left me 10,000 for college and my mom has around 28,000. This will roughly pay for about 3 years at OSU, as average tuition should is around 13,000 (please fact check me if I'm wrong) but my mom told me that she is willing and easily able to pay for my entire four years if I go to OSU, because the remaining amount of money should be doable. My problem is I am struggling to decide if the resentment I will build by being at home for 4 years and not seeing the world, being stuck with my younger siblings, not having any freedom, is a greater struggle than the potential of having student loans if I go somewhere else. I'm not interested in going to any other colleges in Ohio besides OSU (despite me not having that much of an interest in OSU to begin with) because most of the other colleges do not offer me as much as OSU does considering I will graduate high school with a year more than a year of college credits from them and I can live at home if I go to OSU. Still, despite recognizing this is idealistic, I dream of something different and hate the potential of being here another four years. I hate living in Ohio, I'm a college student yet have no college friends and barely any high school friends (and they're graduating this year.) I want a fresh start so bad and I fear of living a life where I just go through the motions. This is really weighing on me and I appreciate any advice I can get.

I plan to go to law school, but if that doesn't work out, I'm going to get my masters degree and see where I end up from there, likely still in a legal/public policy field.

"How can I make my application competitive for top MSEE/MSECE programs. (USA) I am currently an Electrical Engineering major (+ Physics minor) in my 3rd year, and I am sitting at a 3.25 GPA right now with an upward trajectory over the past few semesters. This was mainly due to me having a hard time at the start of college with non-major related coursework and difficult classes for my minor. I have one more year to graduate, and I do want to go to grad school and eventually pursue a PhD. I am able to get admitted into my current school’s 4+1 program if I keep my grades up since my GPA has been increasing progressively - this is not a problem at all. However, I want to shoot my shot at better grad schools than the one I’m currently in. The one I’m targeting claims that successful applicants tend to have a 3.5+ even though their baseline is a 3.0. I am currently doing research under a professor and working towards a publication, and I do have good rapport with professors I’ve worked with from creating class curriculum and grading for lower level classes. Since I have a year left, I do plan to take grad-level classes as electives - the requirements to take them are the same as the 4+1 program Given my background, is it realistic for me to get into a top-tier MS program? Is there anything else I am able to do to stand out aside from the low GPA? This is the best school in my state. I have heard that personal statement and letters of recommendation do matter but I have no clue as to what extent and what kinds of scenarios would it make a difference. Or would it just be better to do the 4+1 at my school and get a GPA reset by being a grad student at my current school?

"Seeking Advice on How to Handle Unfair Grading Practices by a Professor. I'm dealing with a challenging situation involving one of my professors and could use some advice. I recently completed a major database project for a course. The assignment was to create a database, and while the group project was focused on a shopping site, I chose to do mine on a school library because I was informed by a friend that we could choose our topics, and this was never contradicted in the written instructions. After submitting my work, I was penalized with a 60% deduction solely because my topic wasn't the group project's topic. Other students who also chose different topics were not penalized. This professor has previously mocked my capabilities in front of the class during a technical disagreement, and now I feel this grading may be retaliatory because I challenged him. Moreover, when I attempted to discuss this with him through emails, he dismissed my concerns, stating he doesn't ""have time to waste"" and that I should accept the grade without further discussion. He also implied that any further complaints from me would be bothersome. Given these circumstances, how should I approach this situation?

"I hate living in a dorm. I'm a freshman right now and live in a traditional dorm. While I'm lucky enough to have a single, it remains that dorm life feels awful. My dorm room isn't particularly bad or anything, but no matter what I do it just doesn't feel like home. A common answer when I looked up this was just to decorate and stuff and even when I do that I still hate it. Even among posters and lights and rugs, it's still a very very barebones room. Part of it is definitely that it doesn't really feel like there's a clear separation between school and living. Like even after all my stuff is done I still live at my college which means it's hard to really feel like I get a break. Also, the dorms, at least at my uni, are all quite loud and filled with hordes of partying freshmen. It legitimately feels like I'm living at the zoo with how hectic it is, and compared to off-campus apartments/houses that I've visited, it's way more severe in a dorm. I also don't really have the ability to cook my own food or even store food that's not candy or bags of chips. There is the dining hall, obv, but it doesn't really feel the same. This is obviously a very trivial complaint but I like having control over what I eat and the ability to actually cook and eat healthy meals. I'm lucky enough that next year I'll be living off-campus in an apartment of my own, and I'll be able to have a far more normal life. And next semester there's a chance that I'll be able to get into a nicer, quieter, dorm as well.

"Is it rude to skip class. So I got into a debate about this with another person. I was telling them to take care of their own needs because no one was going to do it for them and that they should skip their class in order to make a job interview they really wanted. Of course taking the grade hit and all that is on them and I would never suggest that they do the whole ""what did we miss in class"" or ""I was sick please do not take a portion from my grade"". I was encouraging the person to decide which is more important, the job interview or the small grade hit he would incur from skipping, and then make his decisions based on that. Another person (and many agreed with this person) that my advice was disrespectful to the professors and how rude it was to skip class. I never thought about skipping as being disrespectful but I was in the VAST minority on this opinion. I am now curious if professors feel disrespected when students do not come to class. One thing I want to make very clear, because it kept coming up in the other discussion is that I understand that when you skip class and make it the professors problem then that is disrespectful of their time. I would never suggest asking the professor questions when you skipped the class (because they covered it in class and it is now your job to learn it rather than ask the professor to repeat it) or lying about why you skipped to get out of the lowered grade (assuming attendance is part of the grade) or asking for any type accommodation in general. I understand that all of this is rude but just merely skipping class I do not understand why it is rude. Maybe you can all help me see the other side of it? I guess the way I see it is the professor is still getting their paycheck and they are still in charge of the grade given and so I do not see how it affects them unless the student asks for accommodation. Am I missing a piece of information? I was homeschooled so self study is my go to method and I would sometimes skip class if I felt that what I would be doing otherwise would be worth it or more important and I never even took into consideration the being disrespectful part and now I am curious if I went through my whole college career being rude without even trying to",Attendance,Medium,1.0,web:pullpush:r/AskProfessors:submission:professor rude,Medium,1,2250,433,2,Is it rude to skip class.,0

"Should I Take a $40k Loan to Finish College. I’m in a tough spot and could really use some advice. I’m torn between taking out $40,000 in loans to finish my BA in Computer Science or delaying my graduation again. Here’s the situation: I was supposed to graduate in 2023 but took a couple of years off to deal with personal issues. I need one more semester to complete my degree because I failed three classes earlier in college and still need those credits. I recently re-enrolled at Boston University, but my payment deadline is January 19, so scholarships or saving more money aren’t an option. This would be my ninth semester, and I currently have 116 credits. I’ve been working retail for a year, but I don’t have enough saved to cover tuition. Since it’s my 9th semester BU is giving me no aid on a $45k bill and I'm only getting a pell grant. I’m really not in a good place to wait any longer. I don’t want to live with my mom anymore due to issues, and I’m getting tired of living with my dad too. I don’t think I could handle it for a few more months. I really want to just do it, but the idea of taking on $40,000 in debt is scary, especially with the tough job market in tech right now. It also feels like a scam for only one semester. Has anyone been in a similar situation? Is taking the loan worth it to finally finish, or should I wait and save more (even though it feels like I’ve been waiting forever)? EDIT: A bit more context: I honestly had a rough time with college and just wasn’t ready so my gpa is about 2.2 or something so scholarships and transferring could be tough. The reason for no aid from BU is if you don’t graduate in 8 semesters, your aid runs out. Yes it’s my fault but I was 17 when i started school and i’m 23 now so i feel ready and more mature ofc and after that retail job im tired of low paying jobs that don’t even allow me to live alone. Not looking for sympathy here just looking for some general advice bc i know it’s a situation i put myself in but i just don’t know how to unfuck it. If i don’t go it feels like 4 years wasted.

I know there are other “hidden” fees though such as textbooks, placements, etc, but is it really worth taking a loan out or just saving up at least the first 2 years of study? On top of this, the gov is bringing out a new initiative beginning June next year where they actually pay you about $300 a week when on placement.

"Why God Became Human. Definitions of terms: * Justice: retributive justice, whereby I mean to give each their due. * God: The greatest being possible. Being the greatest being possible would include moral perfection (which would itself include being all just and all merciful, etc.). \------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ # FIRST REASON The first reason is that sins against an infinite God is a wrong of infinite severity or is at least a wrong which none greater can be conceived (see below). This is due to the severity of the wrong being dependent on the moral status of the entity sinned against, all other things being equal. Wrong against an animal is more severe than wrong against a plant, while wrong against a human is more severe than wrong against an animal, all other things being equal. Since God is of infinite ontological or moral status, the severity of the wrong for the sin against Him is infinite (the severity of the wrong goes up as the ontological status of the being wronged goes up, all other things being equal). Only God could correct such a wrong, but only man is responsible for correcting it. It follows that salvation requires that God become man. Keep in mind that this principle only applies when all other moral considerations are equal. Let's say someone steals five dollars from their friend, and another person tortures an animal. The Status Principle does not imply that stealing the five dollars is worse, because all other things are not equal. Other moral considerations come into play to determine which is worse. Also, I don’t think the “infinite” in this discussion must be a mathematically modeled notion of infinity, as if there were individual units of dignity for a being (e.g., this cow has 14, I have 100, Archangel Michael has 145, etc) or individual units of demerit for an action (e.g., stealing a cow is worth 15 demerits, punching a nun is worth 200, etc). Instead of thinking of God’s moral status as quantitatively infinite, or even a qualitative infinite, perhaps it is better to think of it as being the limit case, or perhaps even that moral status is that which none greater can be conceived. So if one is caught up in the ""infinite"" in my argument, replace it with ""that which none greater can be conceived."" It would look like this: &gt;Since God is a being than which none greater can be conceived, the severity of the wrong for the sin against Him that which none greater can be conceived (the severity of the wrong goes up as the ontological status of the being wronged goes up, all other things being equal). Only God could correct such a wrong, but only man is responsible for correcting it. It follows that salvation requires that God become man. For an ancient Christian author who thought in terms similar to Anselm (who included both social and ontological status into his main argument), see: John Chrysostom: “But you know that offences are also judged by the quality of the persons: for instance, he who insulted a private person has done wrong, but not so much as he who has insulted a magistrate, and he who has offended a greater magistrate offends in a higher degree, and he who offends an inferior one in a lower degree. But he who insults the King offends much more. The injury indeed is the same, but it becomes greater by the excellence of the person. And if he who insults a king receives intolerable punishment on account of the superiority of the person, for how many talents will he be answerable who insults God?” - Saint John Chrysostom, Homily 1 on Philemon 1-3 &amp;#x200B; * **Objection #1: God cannot be harmed, and so cannot be wronged.** God being infinite or eternal does not logically preclude Him from being harmed. God is a consciousness. Thus, it is logically possible for Him to be harmed in a psychological like manner, or by having the conscious experience of pain but, not corporeal damage. In fact, the OT consistently speaks of God being in some sort of psychological pain in response to people's sin: “Yet they rebelled and grieved his Holy Spirit. So, he turned and became their enemy and he himself fought against them.” - Isaiah 63:10. There’s also no good reason to think that physical harm is the only norm of what is ""wrong."" Being a closet diehard racist is wrong even if they never happen to cause harm to others or themselves in any way. Likewise for any other heinous belief or conscious thought. Even further, my wife could wrong me if she cheated on me, even if I never found out and was not harmed by her action. Another example: you might wrong me by frustrating goals. So likewise, you can wrong God by frustrating his goal to unite all humans to him, say, by being a hypocritical Christian that leads others to reject the gospel. So even if God can't be harmed, why think the discussion of wronging Him stops there? Keep in mind that while beliefs or even certain thoughts may not be a choice in the sense of, say, choosing what to eat, it does seem that people do have at least what psychologists and philosophers call ""indirect doxastic voluntarism."" &amp;#x200B; * **Objection #2: Guilt cannot be imputed or transferred in PSA or vicarious satisfaction.** In addition to many of the points made below in the next atonement section, which apply here also (e.g., the point about the metaethical view), there are parallels in our human justice system that would allow the imputation of sins so that the God-man could fulfill justice for our sins without committing those sins. I introduce vicarious liability. Vicarious liability is when the liability for a crime committed is put on another who acts as a representative of the person that committed the crime. This representative can endure part of the deserved punishment or should they wish the full punishment. In the God-man's case he could have acted as our representative through vicarious liability in order to take the punishment we deserve without violating negative retributive justice. Indeed, vicarious liability can even be another case of strict liability, where the someone (e.g., a superior) is held to be guilty \*without being found blameworthy,\* since no mens rea is required. Here is what this informative website says: ""In criminal law, strict liability is liability for which mens rea (Latin for “guilty mind”) does not have to be proven in relation to one or more elements comprising the actus reus (Latin for “guilty act”) although intention, recklessness or knowledge may be required in relation to other elements of the offence. The liability is said to be strict because defendants will be convicted even though they were genuinely ignorant of one or more factors that made their acts or omissions criminal. The defendants may therefore not be culpable in any real way, i.e. there is not even criminal negligence, the least blameworthy level of mens rea."" [https://www.lawteacher.net/free-law-essays/criminal-law/strict-liability.php#:\~:text=In%20criminal%20law%2C%20strict%20liability%20is%20liability%20for,in%20relation%20to%20other%20elements%20of%20the%20offence](https://www.lawteacher.net/free-law-essays/criminal-law/strict-liability.php#:~:text=In%20criminal%20law%2C%20strict%20liability%20is%20liability%20for,in%20relation%20to%20other%20elements%20of%20the%20offence). This is truly imputation of guilt. One needs to show that this parallel isn't analogous to the God-man's case in any relevant respect. Even if that can be shown, that could be a deficiency of our legal system. Indeed, one would need to provide a defeater to our sins being imputed to the God-man. &amp;#x200B; * **Objection #3: The severity of the offense committed also depends on the moral status of the one who committed it. So, wrong by an animal is not as morally weighty as wrong by a human, all other things being equal. The severity of the wrong goes up when the ontological status of the being who sinned goes up. And so since the sinner in this case is not infinite (human beings), it stands to reason that the punishment is not infinite or incommensurable.** The reasoning of this objection doesn’t work. Anything times infinity is infinity. And so, if I were a, say, 6 on the ontological-status-meter, that times infinity would still max out my blameworthiness. The same holds if I’m only a.004 on the ontological-status-meter. In short, the mitigation due to my ontological status will not render my culpability to less than infinity in light of wronging an infinite being. The same holds true for the conception of sins against a being than which none greater can be conceived. &amp;#x200B; * **Objection #4: Necessitarian accounts of Vicarious Satisfaction and PSA limit God because Him fulfilling His requirement of justice serves as a precondition for forgiveness. God must do something in order to forgive.** This objection ignores the fact that the necessity of the atonement lays in God's nature rather than only His will. Something can only be said to limit God if it imposed by something beyond Himself. God not being able to let wrongdoing go unpunished no more limits God than Him not being able to lie (2 Timothy 2:13). God as Judge can't act in a way that is not consistent with His nature. Once again, omnipotence does not include bringing about logical contradictions. &amp;#x200B; * **Objection #5: God the Son became a man and died in our place in order to save us from God the Father.** Yet it's a strawman to say that we are saved from God. Rather, we are saved from our sin, and more importantly for the models in this post, *from the just consequences of our sin*. This is basic Christian doctrine. If you are a criminal guilty of serious crime in, say, a country with the best justice system humanly possible, and you get a pardon from that government, did the government pardon you from the *just* consequences of your wrongdoing, or the government pardon you from the government? &amp;#x200B; * **Objection #6: Doing goods has infinite significance, and so offsets infinite wrongs, so long as one does more or an equal amount of good in comparison to bad.** Doing good does not nullify infinite wrongs. Indeed, it strikes me that praise and blame might be asymmetric here. I think punching my mom is graver than punching some stranger, given our relationship. I think that failing to help my mom after surgery is graver than failing to help a stranger, given our relationship. I don’t think that helping my mom is more praiseworthy than helping a stranger, due to our relationship. Helping my mom might well be more obligatory, whereas helping a stranger might well be supererogatory. Or failing to help a stranger is graver than failing to help an animal. It could be that there is greater obligation to help a stranger human than an animal. And the supererogatory is, all else equal, more praiseworthy than the obligatory. So it seems to me that there is an asymmetry in the case of blameworthy offense and praiseworthy action with respect to those we bear special relations to, like our parents and God. So even prima facie, good actions cannot outweigh bad ones, for we already owe God total obedience in our behavior towards our fellow humans and bearers of the images of God, as well as towards God Himself. See the first paragraph in the next section below for more comment on this. ""If. the heavenly kingdom be made up of men, and this cannot be effected unless the aforesaid satisfaction be made, which none but God can make and none but man ought to make, it is necessary for the God‑man to make it."" - Anselm of Canterbury. \------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ # SECOND REASON. The second reason is that God's moral attributes are immutable (God is defined as the ""greatest being possible""). All have transgressed God's law and are guilty. Sure, there are some better than others. But being better than others does not make you \*good enough\*. Even if you do the speed limit most of the time, a cop would be just in issuing you a ticket if he caught you violating the speed limit. Sure, they could show mercy, but then the cop is relaxing justice, and God can't relax an attribute essential to His nature. But how can God as Judge forgive guilty people and remove their liability to justice \*while remaining all just\*? Sure, a judge has the power to not convict a criminal, but they would no longer be just. Traditionally omnipotence doesn’t include bringing about logical contradictions so even God wouldn’t be able to relax justice while still being fully just. Mercy seems a relaxation of justice, and justice a refusal of mercy. The laws of logic seem to prevent God from being both just and merciful at the same time in response to human sin. God solves this dilemma on the cross. Full justice is fulfilled: sin is punished through an infinite being (thus having infinite merit), but mercy is also enacted. The trick is for God to give \*us\* the mercy and \*Himself\* the justice. &amp;#x200B; * **Objection #1: It is not** ***just*** **for an innocent person to be punished for the sins of others.** This argument has many assumptions which are not defended but required for the argument to work. First, most people don't realize that only negative retributive justice holds it to be wrong to punish someone who is innocent. Since there are other views of justice this objection can't even lift itself off the ground without independent argument *for* negative retributive justice. Second the argument will need to get contextualized in some metaethical view. Not all metaethical views will make it be immoral for God to not be a negative retributive judge even if negative retributive justice is correct for us. One will need to find a metaethical view where God would need to be a negative retributive judge and defend that view, or defend that negative retributive justice is an essential attribute of God's nature. Next there is the assumption that there are no weightier moral considerations that override the prima facie demands of negative retributive justice. Even among those who hold to retributive justice there are many that recognize such overriding considerations may waiver the demands of retributive justice. In this case the salvation of world could serve as such a weightier moral consideration. Even the staunchest of retributivists like Michael Moore agree that the demands of retributive justice are prima facie demands that can be overridden in specific cases: &gt;“A 'threshold' deontologist refuses to violate a categorical norm of morality until not doing so produces sufficient bad consequences as to pass some threshold, then, he will override such categorical norms.” - Michael S. Moore, Placing Blame: A Theory of Criminal Law, p. 158, n. 13. So, if one must punish an innocent (especially if they are willing), or else the world be totally destroyed (or lost!), that person should be punished. I think this makes sense and I don’t see a defeater to such a proposal. Finally, there is the assumption that if a person isn't the one who commits the sin that they can't then be considered legally guilty for those sins. See above for the response to that. Since our guilt was imputed onto the God-man, technically, he was extrinsically guilty, though intrinsically innocent. &amp;#x200B; * **Objection #2: The God-man did not suffer eternal hell.** First, while the God-man's punishment and the revoking of the Father's blessings from Him was not infinite as to duration, intensity can more than make up for duration. Combine this point with the fact that no one in hell will have suffered for an actually infinite amount of time at any given moment, since the future is merely \*potentially\* infinite, as opposed to being an actual infinite, I think that this point is weakened. Second, more importantly and more simply though, the God-man's blood has infinite merit. The God-man could have suffered for five minutes and that alone would be sufficient to satisfy divine justice by His having infinite ontological status. Thus, the God-man's suffering, though it lasted only a finite time, was infinite in merit and thus enough the compensate for the suffering of the damned. Keep in mind also that on some models of PSA at least, it's not about matching the hatred of hell, but more about fulfilling the justice and mercy of God at the same time in light of human sin. Perhaps the merit of the punishment doesn't even need to be exact. &amp;#x200B; * **Objection #3: If I can forgive someone without any punishment and no violation of justice, why can't God?** The problem with this argument is that it is based on construing God on the analogy of a private party involved in various personal relationships rather than as a Judge. Regular people are free to show mercy without being held to justice. By contrast a judge in many contexts have an obligation to do justice—at minimum upholding the rule of the law. Thus, legal philosopher Jeffrie Murphy notes that if the judge ""is moved, even by love or compassion, to act contrary to the rule of law—to the rules of justice—he acts wrongly” - Jeffrie Murphy, “Mercy and Legal Justice,” in *Forgiveness and Mercy, ed. Jeffrie G. Murphy and Jean Hampton* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988), pp. 175-76. In short, God as Judge and the law itself cannot merely forgive without violating his all just nature. Indeed, without God upholding moral responsibility for wrong actions, we wouldn't live in a moral universe. But God can't just let everyone's just due fall upon them, elsewise He is not fully merciful. Thus comes the solution of God the Son taking the punishment Himself. Further, it's different to say that sinful people should forgive other sinful people, over against a sinless entity forgiving sinful beings. &amp;#x200B; * **Objection #4: The Bible already had a system of repentance with no substitute required.** Penal Substitution merely shows *how* it is the case that an all-just God can forgive based on repentance without denying His own nature. Whenever someone is forgiven, it is on the basis of the cross. Further, repentance is not good enough to clear one's liability to Justice &amp;#x200B; * **Objection #5: What about people before the coming of the God-man?** If someone repents and turns to God before the God-man's first coming, His atonement would be applied to them without their conscious knowledge of it. For them, waking up to heaven would be like receiving a will from a family member that you never met and knew about. Further, in the OT, I would argue that for at least some people in the covenant of Israel (or at least the Biblical authors), the God-man was ""dimly perceived"" (to quote OT scholar Peter J. Gentry). This would have included those rare BCE Gentile believers of YHWH (like Job?). &amp;#x200B; * **Objection #6: If the God-man takes the punishment due sinners, then all would be saved.** The God-man's death potentially accomplished the redemption of all men, but for redemption to be actualized in each person, the gift must be freely accepted by that person. Like a pardon that has been issued and yet refused, the God-man's redeeming work remains inefficacious in the lives of those who freely reject Him. This explains why the God-man is the only way to salvation. If you don't accept the pardon (or more rightly, the gift), then one falls back on God's Justice. &amp;#x200B; * **Objection #7: This view presupposes an illogical form of justice where it doesn't matter who is punished for wronging, so long as** ***someone*** **is punished for sins, justice is satisfied.** There are contexts where imputation of guilt is not appropriate, and contexts where it can be. Just because imputation of guilt is inappropriate in some circumstances does not mean it is inappropriate in all circumstances. Thus, this counter presupposes that there are no contexts where imputation of guilt is allowed based on it not being allowed *some* or *certain* contexts is not good logic. Equally important is that it is NOT a third party who gets punished on this theory of atonement. It could NOT have just been anyone. It had to be God Himself because of His being infinite in value, and the necessity of His moral attributes needing to be fully and equally true at the same time in response to human sin. “And Psalms 88 and 69, again speaking in the Lord’s own person, tell us further that He suffered these things, not for His own sake but for ours. ‘Thou has made Thy wrath to rest upon me,’ says the one; and the other adds, ‘I paid them things I never took.’ For He did not die as being Himself liable to death: He suffered for us, and bore in Himself the wrath that was the penalty of our transgression, even as Isaiah says, ‘Himself bore our weaknesses.’” - Saint Athanasius, Letter to Marcellinus. \------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ # THIRD REASON. Adam and Eve, as well as man in general, has freely sold themselves to or at least aligned themselves with Satan through sin. As such, Satan has a sort of legal right over mankind, and God has to respect our free choice to align with Satan. Following most church fathers, like Gregory of Nyssa, if God were to take us out of Satan’s grasp, God was required to act in accordance with His Just nature. This means that God couldn’t have torn us from Satan’s grasp by divine fiat without ""leaving a complaint to him who enslaved man” (Gregory, *Catechetical Oration*, 22), and also without violating the free choice humanity has made to align with the Devil. So, God had to become man and entice Satan into exchanging the human race for Himself through his virtuous deeds and miracles, etc. Given Satan's limited knowledge, he did not know that the God-man was both divine and human. Thinking that he could kill the God-man, Satan exchanges humanity for the God-man, and uses his human minions to kill the God-man to destroy both Him, and humanity afterwards. The God-man however then shows his divine nature which cannot be held by death by rising from the dead. Satan’s purchase over anyone is thus nullified. The main point here is that God had to respect humanity's free decision to hand themselves over to Satan and his legal right over us, and so if God were to buy humanity back, He had to do so without violating His Justice and goodness. Some scholars think that this atonement theory contradicts the above two. I think not. * **Objection #1: Many object to Satan having rights over humanity by using analogies such as kidnappers or terrorists having no legal right over their victims, with bargains being made to such people only out of necessity not due to any form of Justice.** Yet these examples don't work because the victims of kidnappers and terrorists do not freely choose their kidnapping or hostage, nor do they freely align themselves with the perpetrators as Ransom says humans do with Satan. &amp;#x200B; * **Objection #2: God lies to Satan, which is contrary to God's nature.** This view also does not necessarily entail that God lied to Satan, though Gregory did take this line with his fish bait analogy. However, it seems misguided to speak of God necessarily deceiving Satan just because God concealed information. Wrongful deception in this case involves concealing from someone a truth when they have a right to it. It seems absurd to suppose that Satan deserved to know that the God-man's death would not be permanent. Satan just made a miscalculation by underestimating the God-man's power and is not a matter of God deceiving Satan. Think of a bully that miscalculated the resources of their victim. What possible circumstance might require the victim to point out to the bully the resources or abilities that said victim might have to protect themselves? \------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ # FOURTH REASON. Due to the effects of sin, three ways of knowing God have proven insufficient: observation of the human soul fashioned for God; the evidence of creation; and the law and prophets. Human beings, turned from directing their thoughts to the one God, have instead come to the last frontier of irrationality and perversion, which is idolatry, the worship of the creature and of the material, instead of the Creator. As Athanasius says in his work *On the Incarnation*, ""Men, contemptuous of better things and shrinking from their apprehension, sought rather what was closer to themselves—and what was closer to them was the body and its sensations. So, they turned their minds away from intelligible reality and began to consider themselves. And by considering themselves and cleaving to the body and other senses, deceived as it were in their own interests, they fell into selfish desires and preferred their own good to the contemplation of the divine."" Thus, Athanasius questions, “What was God to do. except to renew again in the image,” so that through it, human beings would once again be able to know Him? Athanasius says it is unbecoming of Gods' goodness to allow humanity to continue in their path. Athanasius thus speaks of the Word having to become a human and reveal Himself through the works of the body, engaging in the human senses in order to teach humans of God. To sum, if human beings have turned their attention to the material and to the earthly pleasures of the senses, to what is lower, then like a good teacher that must begin at the level of his students’ understanding, in order to raise their minds to what is higher, God must become a material person. \------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ # FIFTH REASON. The God-man came and suffered/died for us in order to show the depth and extent of God's love for us, which in turn lights a flame within many to more naturally turn to God and love others. While this reason may not be necessary in the same sense as the above reasons are, God becoming a man to teach us the way seems most fitting",Examination,Medium,1.0,web:pullpush:r/academia:submission:complaint,Medium,1,26191,4335,5,Why God Became Human.,0

"For undergrad, I was one of those ghost students for the non-COVID zoom semesters. In my case, it was mainly undiagnosed and untreated disability issues and mental health issues, combined with the fact that I could skate by with As and Bs without attending class. My immune system was crashed so I caught basically everything on campus, my doctors didn't know what was going on with me, and I was too stubborn to drop out while I figured out what was happening. On top of that, I was dealing with mental health issues that made it even harder. If I hadn't been able to keep my grades up, I probably would have dropped out. If COVID hadn't hit halfway through and forced a transition to online school, where I could actually have 'perfect attendance' (aka, do all the assignments and discussion posts), I also probably would have dropped out. I usually ended up dropping half my classes or getting a late medical drop through the back end of my degree, which extended me out about two and a half years. It sucked. I was so frustrated with myself, but even if I managed to make it all the way to the parking lot, I'd often be too dizzy to actually go to class. I remember once just being close to tears with my head on the steering wheel as I waited for the world to stop spinning around me and knowing that class was going on without me. It took until the end of the class period before I was safe to drive. That said, I was likely an edge case. Some of these students might be forced to go to college by parents and just don't care. Many of them are likely dealing with depression and anxiety- once you skip a few, it becomes increasingly harder to go because of the anxiety of what people will think.

"Graduating with my Master's degree but now considering going for a PhD if presented with the opportunity - advice. Hi, all. I hope everyone is well. I am writing this in hopes to get some information from others in college/university/educational situations. I feel like my eyes have been opened for the first time in a long time, and now I am wondering if anyone can provide information if they have been in a similar situation. Currently I (23) am finishing my master's degree in healthcare administration (in short looking at public health trends and figuring out the best way to administer aid to prevent trends from occurring). I told myself this would be my last degree or that I don't plan to go above a master's degree. Yet, I was talking with my supervisor (I work as a graduate assistant at a university) who is currently finishing her PhD in a nursing field, and I was telling her what I wanted to do. Particularly in the area of research, data analysis, etc. She looked at me and told me that I should go for my PhD. I know a PhD is really research based and aligns with what I am interested in (disease analytics, public policy avocations, disease prevention plans, epidemiological research.). But I genuinely don't know if I can do another five odd years in school. This would be a PhD in Public health. In the back of my head, I always told myself that I wanted to really lead research. I couldn't bare to sit at an office doing the same thing over and over and over again. What I mean by that is I want to do something progressive, something where I learn and lead something new. I want to do something where I can interact with communities and ensure that I am putting prevention methods into place to help save lives, to help understand why a prevention method isn't working and what SHOULD be done in the future. I guess my realization is I was always interested in a PhD. I guess what I am saying is if the opportunity presented itself where I could get a PhD for free (or on top of my job benefits) then who am I to say no? I am applying to jobs at University's (there are research positions) that might be able to have an opportunity to provide an educational program in addition to work. I have read about this during my master's where educational degrees can be a benefit/incentive for those who are interested in going for a degree. I never thought I would apply that logic this early, haha! Anyways, has anyone else done something similar where they thought they were done in their degree only to have the opportunity to go back and get another degree? Or they decided after X amount of years that they think a PhD or upper degree aligns with what they want to do?

"I'm 23 and in grad school, and as someone that currently can't afford to move to D.C. to take my classes in person, I've gone through many of the same feelings you have. First off, I think it's great that you decided to act on your passion from a young age and kept your education moving forward even though you knew it was going to be through an isolating circumstance. Since you have two years left, I think it's definitely worthwhile to keep pushing through and just focus on that finish line. Of course, I think it might be helpful to write down the pros and cons regarding possibly transferring. At the end of the day, I'll always stand by the belief that your mental health and well-being come first. You're so young, and it works both ways, you can afford a year or two of delay if needed. The scholarship question is definitely important, and given the state of the economy in the next year or so, don't take on debt if you don't have to, especially for undergrad. So, I think it will certainly help clear your mind a little if you do properly consider both decisions and their consequences. Men should focus on their health and happiness. Just like every other human on the planet. It's a privilege to be able to prioritize that, and I understand that career choices and other factors come into play. I spent all of my undergrad knowing I was going to law school. COVID stole my fourth year and forced me into a six-month gap where I realized instead that I wanted to get a Ph.D. To now, I don't feel like I've lost any time at all and I'm grateful that I'm in a place where I'm studying something that I truly feel matters to me. You've also done great in going to those internships and making those connections. Treasure those socially enriching experiences if you manage to score this next gig because you never know who you will meet or what opportunities come about. Sometimes, it does feel like a robbery when it ends, but at the same time, you managed to have those moments. I can relate to that lonely, empty feeling like you, and such a large and independent city like New York doesn't really help that sometimes, it makes it worse in fact. But you're on a good path and you should commend yourself for the things you have done well so far.

In a certain program, they have two specific classes that are prereqs and are hard to find-of course they are located in the very school of a PA program that I was going to apply to.

"Undergraduate student feeling exploited and cheated by PI. I was approached by a graduate student at the beginning of this year who offered a volunteer project with the promise of co-authorship on the resulting publication. The arrangement has been approved by the PI. I very happily and willingly completed all of my assigned tasks including literature review, data analysis, figure preparation and manuscript drafting and did everything the graduate student asked me to. The PI was happy with our results so far in the mid-project review a few months ago. He assured us again that we would all be co-authors. Fastforward to very recently, I found out via the grad student that the PI wants to take my name off the co-authorship. The paper has become too long and he wants to split off one section and develop it further into another paper. He now offers me coauthorship on the new one instead, ""depending on my performance and contributions"" to that sub-topic. The main problem is that the sub-topic is the most underdeveloped section in the whole project, it will take many more months just to complete the data collection and expand it into a full paper. This is really shocking to me because I have not done anything wrong to offend him. The graduate student is confused as well, we have been working on this almost-completed paper as recently as last week without any complaints from the PI and we have no idea what went wrong with him. I'm trying very hard to keep my cool but I find this extremely frustrating and enraging because I've spent countless hours on my computer doing the data analysis over the last few months and I even worked during the weekends. Now I feel like all my effort has been for absolutely nothing. I wouldn't have mind volunteering for this even without co-authorship if they've told me that clearly from the beginning. But I've been repeatedly promised co-authorship and now that I've handed over all of my deliverables and made sure the project has been pushed to near-completion, the PI takes back his word and I feel like I've been cheated and exploited. I am trying to meet the PI in the next few days, what should I say? Who else should I talk to and what should I do? **Edit:** Good news, I have resolved the issue with the PI. The meeting was surprisingly straightforward and pleasant. I explained the list of things I've done and walked through the materials I've prepared. The PI agreed that co-authorship is warranted. Long story short, the PI has apparently, been receiving incomplete or even possibly inaccurate information about my contributions from the grad student.

"Worried about losing my cool with some students. Throwaway account for reasons that will become apparent. Last week, I was holding a test. Time was up and a few students were still writing, most of the class had left or was queued and about to turn in their test. As they left, I gave a final warning and said if they didn't stop right now, they would get an F. One stopped and came forward, two kept writing. A few seconds lapsed and they kept writing. I walked over to one of them, picked up their exam and calmly tore it in two. I walked over to the other and did the same thing. They were pretty taken aback, I firmly explained that I had warned them and that it was unfair of them to try to take more time than other students. I didn't yell or insult them or anything, but obviously I responded unprofessionally when I tore the tests. I have had a lot of students pushing past boundaries lately and I think it just got to me. In the future, I'll just walk out in circumstances like these and refuse to take their test. That's what I should have done. But I've been increasingly worried since then about how to handle things and what will happen if either student has filed a complaint. Should I tell the chair? Apologize to the students? I'm here on short-term contracts and the contract for next year is signed. I just joined the department and it's large so I don't know many people.

"Help! Penn State or UMiami for engineering. Okay so I’m seriously freaking out. I’m down to my final two schools — Penn State and UMiami — and I have no idea what to do. I’m going in as undeclared engineering because honestly, I have zero clue what type of engineering I want to do yet. The plan was to just figure it out freshman year and officially declare sophomore year. I toured Penn State, but I only did the virtual tour for UMiami. I hate cold weather, like actually hate it, and that’s a big thing holding me back from Penn State. Miami would be so much nicer weather-wise and honestly I feel like I’d probably just be happier there, but I’m scared that going to Miami means I’ll have way less engineering opportunities compared to Penn State. I’ve been trying so hard to find people who have done engineering at UMiami, but it’s basically impossible. Which is weird, because I know they’re supposedly putting a lot of money into their engineering school and trying to grow it. But still, I can’t find many real experiences. Meanwhile, Penn State engineering is super well known, and I know a lot more about what I’d be getting there. Also, another thing — I took a bunch of AP exams, and at Penn State I’m getting a ton of credit for them (they take a lot of 3s and 4s). At UMiami, they mainly only give credit for 4s and 5s, so I wouldn’t be getting nearly as much credit there. So Penn State would save me more money and maybe even time toward graduating. Cost-wise though, they’re basically the same because I got a huge scholarship at UMiami. So money isn’t really the issue — it’s more just about the engineering program, the environment, and what will actually set me up better. Also random but important: I have celiac disease and have to eat gluten free, so if anyone knows anything about how good (or bad) the dining options are at either school for that, please tell me.

"I'm finally graduating! But, I'm embarrassed cause it's so much later than I planned. This whole graduation thing has been a journey, to put it mildly. Nine years for this undergrad degree (7 actually I'm school) – the first in my dad's family to even do it, which is a thing. My dad even paid for a custom stole because the generic first-gen ones were just.awful. This whole odyssey has been a painful journey of ""what if"". My grandma passed away while I was at my second school. If I had stayed at my first school and graduated back in 2020 as planned, she would have been there to see it. So, COVID happened, then I took a year off and transferred to another school. I finished my first degree there and was still working with my main professor on the second one when I had to take a medical leave. I had major surgery. She'd check on me often. I loved her very much and wanted to do well by her. Tragically, she passed away during that time, so I didn't return to pursue the second degree. I officially applied for graduation for the second time back in January (first time, my main professor couldn't sign off that week/month cause.well). The school wasn't helpful and I just took a step back with my transcript in hand lol. Second time was a success! The big graduation ceremony is actually happening next week, but honestly, the thought of being there alone and feeling out of place just feels too heavy, so I'm not going. My mom doesn't really like to travel, so she wouldn't have been at the big ceremony anyway. That's why I've been buying some grad-related stuff recently – to try and have some kind of experience since I'm skipping the real thing, which my mom made some rude comments about me spending money on. I just want to get the experience! Plus, my mom's been really upset about my brother dropping out of college (which I totally understand and am glad he did for his health), but it feels like that's completely overshadowed the fact that I'm ACTUALLY graduating. I'm also getting awarded some cords and taking nice photos to keep. It's my time and I'll enjoy it. Instead, my dad and I are doing a little thing at the alumni event the day before graduation, and people will even be wearing their regalia, which is nice. Food and a toast will be good. I'll still do the cap and tassel thing, wearing the custom stole my dad got, and take pics. Borrowed a gown saved cash. It's not how I pictured it, especially feeling behind. Turning my tassel alone there, without my professor and loved classmates, feels weird, like it's not a big deal to some. We're also having a grad party, and I considered the tassel there, but it's just different. Finally getting this degree now, years late, feels strange to post. Friends have master's, highlighting my off-schedule path. At my second school, people thought I was a grad student, which is almost funny. I was liked and did my thing, so it's not that, just feeling out of sync. Even practice photos felt forced. Graduation season used to amplify that. I hated it, I had to delete everything for weeks. I'd get sick to my stomach. College was good, but this solo alumni thing feels a bit lonely and heavy with 'what ifs.' Anyway, thanks for listening. I'm still getting that degree, and I get to celebrate a bit with loved ones and friends later this month.

"Should I room with my bestfriend. Okay so I have known this girl, let's call her P, since 5 years, and have been best friends with her for 4 of those years. We used to live in the same dormitory and things were great. Recently P and I applied to a great University and were lucky enough to be selected. Now the university requires the first year students to live together. The accomodation will be given in first come first serve basis and if P and I go together we will get the same room. P is all excited to live with me but I am sceptical. She is a great friend and there are no issues regarding any hygiene or other criteria, I know since I have lived w her a many times while we were out on trips and also known her for such a long time. Moreover, the university has a mess and everything so no fights will revolve around food and expenses. So the issue is last time we came to the college for verification we had to stay together in the premises. All was good and fun until she started talking with this guy call him T who had also come for the same purpose. P had a boyf thn tho the relationship was going downhill. P acted like she hated the guy everytime I talked with her about what she wanted with T but everytime she saw him in the premises all her mannerisms indicated that she was looking for some attention from him. Also T is selected as well and he will be joining the insti w us. So these contradictory activities along with her cheating made me feel irritated. She was justifying her cheating saying that her boyf was a scumbag anyway and she was only talking until one day she went and just made out w him which in all seriousness made me gag NGL. Though P and her boyf broke up just a couple of days later of this incident. The thing is even though these things irritated me they weren't things that should matter to me. It's her personal life. As an introvert living w her still seems agreeable in the sense that I won't have to adapt with people from the first square, I'll always have a friend to rely on, I can always trust her. But the cons are her behaviour or approach to personal life aren't something that I relate or support. I have a part time job and already planning on spending time in the library not bcz of her, but just a personal preference. So, wanted to know should I stay w her as roommates as in actually sharing a room and not a house? Tldr: Good friends with a girl since 4 years. We match good regarding most of the things.

"How do you deal with a roommate who never leaves the dorm. Okay, I want to preface by saying that I am moving out of my dorm at the end of this quarter, although it's for reasons other than my roommate. I still have five weeks left in the quarter, and I feel like this is slowly driving me insane. My roommate wasn't really like this last quarter either, so I've been going crazy. He literally never leaves the dorm, and it infuriates me. I think he leaves for classes, but I never see him leave, and he mostly does online classes. When I leave the dorm, he's sitting on his bed watching something on his laptop, and when I come back he's doing the same thing, in the same place. He also for some reason has his desk aimed directly at my bed, and my half of the room in general. I am a fairly introverted person, and I enjoy my private space and alone time. I can usually just tune him out, but sometimes I get back from class, and I just want to sit on my bed and read my book, and he's just sitting at his desk facing directly at me. He doesn't even leave to go to the dining hall anymore. He makes ramen pretty much every day for lunch and dinner, and the small candle I bought doesn't do much to combat the smell. I understand that it's his right, as he pays for the space. I don't want to just hate on someone for being different from I am. However, it has gotten to the point where it feels like he just doesn't know how to function. If I turn the heat on in the morning and forget to turn it off when I leave for class, the room will be boiling hot when I get back because it doesn't even seem like he notices. Like I said, I am a fairly introverted person. However, I also have anxiety and feel like I need to be productive pretty much all the time because of it. Due to that, I am out of the dorm for most of the day, either. at class, studying, eating, exercising, and being with friends. I also like to get up fairly early and get started on my day. I get up around 7:30, but won't start making too much noise or anything until around 8. I feel like that is a fairly reasonable time to wake up. However he is usually still asleep when I go to class around 10, and I feel bad making noise in the morning, as he will like roll over and make sighing noises when I make a sound that's too loud. I get a lot of anxiety in the mornings, and it helps me to have a set routine. However, it's a little frustrating to do it when I'm constantly trying to be quiet. It honestly wouldn't bother me too much, however recently, he has started waking me up in the middle of the night. Like I said earlier, he mostly seems to be just watching YouTube, or a TV show on his laptop during the day. So at night, when I get back, is usually when he starts to actually work on school work. Keep in mind, this is usually the time that I get back from my day and want to relax, and as I said his desk and desk lamp, are pointed directly at my bed. He seems to actually get some homework done and then goes right back to watching shows on his laptop, sometimes with no headphones and the volume on. And since he only eats ramen for dinner around 5 o'clock, he will wake me up at late hours of the night eating snacks and watching TV. Yesterday he woke me up at 2:30 in the morning, on a MONDAY night, eating food just as loudly as he possibly could. That was honestly like the last straw. I am a fairly introverted and quiet person. I've started spending most of my time at the library to get away from this. I really value my time alone and in the quiet, and this is just pushing me over the edge. I'm not one to really make fun of, or dislike people, but it's gotten to the point where even little things that he does - like singing in the shower - just frustrate me to no end. He really seems like a nice guy, but this all feels really inconsiderate to me. Does anyone have any tips or ideas? I would appreciate anything.

"how do you afford this. This. As someone who finished the PhD, I strongly advise against ANY unfunded grad school, especially a PhD. It's not just about money, since PhD or Master's require a research proposal + defense to graduate. In order to do that, you need a research topic and support from the professor. Professors already have their plate full and realistically can only pay close attention to students they are directly working with (i.e., they are funding with their projects). Unless you are swimming in money, even a Master's is rarely worth it. The only time it might be worth is, since some Master's nowadays are more of a certificate program, if you need that for a career change or jump, it might be something to consider. If your company pays for a master's or phd, go for it. If you get accepted with a full ride (stipend + tuition), go for it. If you don't get anyform of scholarship, drop it. It likely means you weren't a top candidate anyways.

"The problem is that most faculty will view that experience as irrelevant-- just as they would high school teaching. They want to see applicants with experience creating sylalbi, delivering courses, and responding to input (student evaluations, peer evaluations, chair observations, etc.) to improve courses. And they want those courses to be at similar types of schools-- teaching only huge R1 lectures isn't really good prep for teaching classes of 20 at an SLAC, and teaching incarcated adults gen ed courses isn't necessarily good prep for teaching the same course at an R2. The market is grossly oversupplied in most fields, so hiring committees (and deans) are not interested in taking risks or hoping things will work out-- if I have 25+ qualified applicants with 1-2 years full time teaching experience in a similar institution I'm going to rank those applicants higher than anyone who does not have that experience. Most people gain experience while in grad school, or through adjuncting, or increasingly through non-TT term positions or postdocs. The system is broken but from a hiring perspective we have no shortage of applicants who have clear, established records teaching exactly the sorts of classes we need to the sorts of students we enroll. So there's little incentive (none, really) to take a chance on applicants who don't have that record. It'll be different at other types of institutions of course-- move away from PUIs and there's far less emphases on teaching.

I finished my fourth term/class back in May (I'm doing one class per term so 2 classes per semester) and I'm pretty sure I should have finished with a 92% or 93% which would mean I have a 4.0 still.

I have no idea how I could have had a B unless I'm remembering my grade wrong and he decided not to round up this time. I found it while requesting a transcript for work reasons. I'm not sure how that happened or why and now it's too late to see my grade breakdown in Canvas.

"Looking for advice navigating dissertation committee problem. Hi all, I’m looking for advice on how to handle what I consider a difficult situation with my committee. Some background: I’m a PhD candidate in education in the US. My program recently got restructured to where it can be completed within 3 or 4 years and our dissertation only needs to be 120-150 pages. I am in year 3 and have about 50 pages done so far. I’ve been doing research on my dissertation topic since last summer, but when I took my candidacy exams last month, my committees main feedback is that I’m not taking my time on the topic. The problem: my advisor just sent me an email saying he doesn’t think I’ll graduate by May 2025 specifically reciting the committee feedback that I’m not taking my time “to get this right”. I’m becoming increasingly stressed and frustrated by this for several reasons. First, I love learning but am exhausted by the work and am ready to be done. Second, school costs money and I don’t want to pay additional tuition as I already have sizable student debt. Third, I feel like I will be disadvantaged on the job market if I graduate after May as I’m open to both faculty and administrative positions in higher ed that require a PhD. Fourth, and in a silly sense, my partner and I have been planning a vacation to celebrate me graduating, and I feel like I really “need” that for my mental health and we’ve already made reservations. I’m tempted to write to my committee expressing what I listed above in a professional way. Can you offer some advice on what you think makes sense? Should I try and convince them that graduating is more important that having a phenomenal dissertation (I want to do well, but see a dissertation as a means to an end)?

"We have a Super Crazy TA who behaves innapropiratley, but the semester is almost over. What should I do. I've been in a class that has a TA who quietly sits and observes, and for the first time last week they had to teach. Well, it was insane. I think they think they are a ""cool, edgy professor"" and spent the entire class cussing everyone out, being kind of funny and silly at moments but mostly just being a disrespectful nuisance. They barely taught the material properly. They just walked around yelling the whole time, calling students mfs and bitches, climbing over desks, targeting and harassing a few students (I think they jokingly at one point told this girl they wanted to kill her? Anyway, it wasn't lighthearted teasing with these students. No one was laughing then, getting called ugly and stupid, etc), getting directly in everyone's face, touching their hair, again making fun of specific students for no damn reason. It felt like they had been harboring resentment against some of these kids all semester and was just lashing out, even though we don't know this person well at all! And this isn't a young grad student, this person is like 50 and has been a professor before for a decade. Unfortunately they also taught the next day and in their shenanigans they almost broke my friends laptop, threw my belongings on the ground after I told them not to- any annoying and unreasonable thing you can think of, they did it, in the rudest way possible. They also proudly declared they are the worst person we'll ever meet, so it wasn't out of blind ignorance. This was all a bunch of intentional stupidity and I don't see why we should have to endure it. Oh, it's a type of class where you can resubmit assignments for a 100, but they said if we try to resubmit anything that got a 90 for a 100, they refuse to grade it and we have to stick with the 90, even though that could be the difference between a B and an A in the class. Obviously, a lot of students were very unhappy after class, especially the girl they targeted on the first day, a handful said they wanted to say something to someone but weren't sure what to do. I saw through the schtick right away and just endured it annoyed the first day, but on the second day when they almost broke my friends laptop and threw my stuff on the ground, i realized I might wanna say something, especially about the laptop? Laptops are expensive and you shouldn't risk someone else's property just to fulfill your annoying edgy teacher image. All that said, this person is a blink away from finishing their PhD and the semester is almost over-- there isn't anything that can be Done about their behavior? So I can't see a point in saying anything. Like what is gonna happen, one 50 year old professor is gonna reprimand another 50 year old professor? If they manage to get a teaching job somewhere else and pull this shit on the first day, I doubt they'd get very far. If my friend with the laptop doesn't want to say anything then I won't, and I doubt the few students who said they wanna say something did, because that's usually how this goes. However, I am that annoying narc, and if anyone wants me to say something I 100% will and have before. (People are shy, I get it, but I'm not). Because of how genuinely crazy I think this person is, I don't wanna say anything unless i can be anonymous or have multiple students backing up the complaints. So what do yall think, should I even say anything? I kinda can't see a point but I cannot exaggerate how crazy this was enough. Really genuine crackhead behavior, and I feel really bad for the students who got mocked and made fun of, and I'm pissed about the laptop and my stuff! Edit: again, this is not a novice teacher. This is a 50 year old person who has multiple graduate degrees and had a professional teaching career as a professor for over a decade. This person has been a professor for 10 years. UPDATE: Myself and 2 other students documented things for the professor in email last week, and they are no longer TA-ing for our class. That's good enough for me, initially I felt really horrible about saying anything but now I realize I shouldn't because it was entirely their choice to behave that way and has nothing to do with me.

Yes, there’s a good chance you lost your scholarship and might be heading towards to suspension but that really isn’t important at this point even though I’m sure you feel it is. After you’ve gotten that scheduled you need to find a therapist and psychiatrist and get set up with them. Start by checking with your schools health clinic/office.

As I mentioned I went through similar when I was younger and ended up in a cycle where I’d think I was “better” and go back and do really good for a semester then end up failing the following semester. As a result I now have multiple semesters of academic probation and academic suspension on my transcript but I’ve finally really gotten “better” and returned after a long break and am slowly bringing my GPA back up and doing really well. Yes, things were delayed for me for years but I realised that my health was more important in the long run than a degree.

"Need some advice on contacting the department head about my thesis advisor. As per title. I've had a series of breakdowns of communication in the course of my thesis that have just eaten up **months** of my time and I feel like my advisor is almost adversarial at this point (or perhaps neglectfully apathetic). For reference, I am developing a series of algorithms for large scale data collection, processing of said data, and modelling of said data that will turn what would be weeks of manual collection etc into 2-3 hours at most. Algorithms are developed, models have been run, now I'm on the writeup and I'm almost feeling paralyzed by how many times I've just had to throw work out. I have text examples to back up these points, but in summary here are the instances: 1. I ask my advisor about the publication of code with my thesis, he says to ask another professor. I ask said professor, who is of the opinion its perfectly fine and from there I start including direct code samples in 30 pages of text when discussing operating parameters, possible bugs, etc. When I mention this to my advisor, he says under no circumstances should code be included in the body of the thesis and it is completely inappropriate. Makes me throw it all out and tells me to include it in flowcharts. Comments about how it sounded like I was writing too much anyway. 2. After converting the data processing algorithm into flowcharts, I forward the charts to him and tell him that a) this was my shortest algorithm and b) my modelling algorithms (of which I have three) are about 20x the length and therefore it probably will be longer than the entire length of the submission (meaning my entire submitted thesis) he wanted. He makes **no commentary** on this, and when I finish and submit my 35 pages of flowcharts he tells me to stash them in an appendix or don't include them at all as they are too long to be included into what he wants for the main narrative of my thesis. So, all that work for something I won't be allowed to include in my thesis. 3. This communication started before points 1 and 2, but just came to fruition recently. Originally, I had planned to analyze a conclusion of a publication against different factors, which I didn't think would be a big deal as it was published just a year before I began my study and infrastructure usually doesn't change too much in that amount of time. However, when I started really digging into their data I found that it was collected six years ago, they had been in analysis for about five years, and of course a lot of the infrastructure was radically different from anything I could collect today. My bad. When I asked if I could shift the focus toward education in response to this, however, I was given a green light. Fast forward to just about a week ago and I was told I was including too much info and turning what should be a scientific report into ""a diary"" of sorts. The information? Pricing information for Places API anyone actually using my data collection algorithm would need to understand to optimize for their budget. With the diary comment in particular, I feel like he's forgotten our discussion on shifting the focus of my thesis—which means if he now expects me to execute my original more analytical focus it'll fall apart in any kind of defense. The one thing I'll give him is that I've had to ask for (and have almost used an entire) extension due to COVID forcing me to be basically a single parent while my partner is working, and the extra care our kiddo needs from his health problems (100+ doctors/er visits, three surgeries with a fourth scheduled, so much interrupted sleep that he's only slept six nights in his almost three years) is slowing me way down both with getting work done and communicating on my part. Still, I feel this is way past the point of acceptability. Where I have pause is that after incident 1 I contacted the course coordinator informally and was told it was my problem, basically. Does anyone have experience in matters like this? Are incidents 2 &amp; 3 enough to tip the scales in my favor? If not, what should I be expected to do? If I have to redo my entire thesis I feel like I'll get a job at a local grocer's or something instead—if any are even available in this economy :(",Academic,Medium,1.0,web:reddit:r/gradschool:search:exam schedule problem,Medium,1,4284,774,0,Need some advice on contacting the department head about my thesis advisor.,0

How does maternity leave benefit an academic? It's meant to begin to equalize the toll that birthing a human has on women's careers (and can't even begin to). The only circumstance I can imagine is that if you have a long term project with collaborators or mentees that gets wrapped up so you have a trickle of productivity continuing while you are on leave that doesn't leave gaps in the CV and may leave you in a slightly more competitive place for fellowships where you get an extension for parental leave or tenure clock extension.

"Collegues creating a very hostile environment in the office and classroom. I am a first-year PhD student at a humanities department at an R1 school. Since last semester, I have been having difficulties with a group of fellow PhDs who have created an extremely hostile environment at our department and in our graduate courses. The department has attempted to intervene; however, these students are both oblivious to their faults and refuse to accept punishment. One of these PhDs has been sexually harassing a few women in our department. Harassment includes making sexual comments about us (in a different language and sharing his thoughts about us with other male colleagues), sharing sexual stories without warning in the office lounge, invading personal space while making comments about how good we smell or what we're wearing, and staring at our chests. Many of us have gone to the department head to complain; however, have not started any formal Title IX complaints. The head spoke to this person, giving him a 'final warning', including moving his office to a different floor. The PhD has avoided us for a few weeks; however, has recently started his bad practices again. When the department tried holding a meeting to address office etiquette, he argued that it would be useless and a waste of time. Other PhDs include this gang of people who can only be described as 'bullies with victim mentalities'. These folks often become hostile in our graduate seminars, attacking people for disagreeing with them (such as by spreading ill word of them, threatening to kick out people who disagree with them from class, and ripping them apart during seminar discussions). Aside from this, they often refuse to let others speak, and they take classes together as a group, and in the end, dominate all discussions and conversations. Many of us also took this up with the head, and when the head facilitated a meeting on this bullying issue, many of them claimed that they were the real victims, and now targets of a department witch hunt. I am now absolutely exhausted by my classes and experience in grad school, especially since I have to be in such close proximity to the people I have described.

"Applying for PhD after failing MPhil --&gt; PhD transfer viva. Hi, I’m hoping for some advice about applying for PhDs after having failed my MPhil --&gt; PhD transfer viva. I'm in the UK, I'm not sure if that makes a difference. I recently failed went into a transfer viva and failed quite spectacularly. In a way this was quite unexpected; my industrial supervisor had seemed very happy with my work, I’d gained very good marks in everything up until this point, and although I have an extremely poor relationship with my supervisor, he had repeatedly stated that I was doing excellent work and progressing well. However, I have some pretty serious issues with the way the viva was carried out. I was not asked about any of the results, theory or methods, described in my transfer report. Although two other professors were present, I was effectively examined by my supervisor, who dismissed all of my answers as wrong. Having checked with postdocs in the group I am certain I was not wrong the vast majority of the time. The viva was short (&lt;30min when they usually go on for close to 2 hours), and I was given no opportunity to re-sit. I did not receive my transfer report back or any marks regarding it. One of the examiners also stated, in writing, that my project was not in their field, and that they did not feel able to mark me on it. The viva came shortly after I had a major argument with my supervisor about him committing fraud lying to sponsors, and presenting results at conferences which I knew to be fabricated (I’ve confronted him about it before, but this time went much worse). It didn’t go well, so I said that I wanted to transfer supervisor, and that I would quit with an MPhil if that were not possible. I was told I would have to wait until after my transfer viva. I went to complain about the way the transfer viva was conducted, and not being allowed to resit, but the response has literally been along the lines of “well, this just happens sometimes when people don’t get on”. I am quite convinced I am not deluding myself into thinking I’m capable when I am not. Every member of the group I’m in (3 postdocs and 5 phd students) has told that they think I’ve been forced off. Furthermore, one of the two viva examiners (not my supervisor, and not the examiner who said they didn’t understand my project), has taken me aside and said that they think I am capable of doing a PhD. They offered to provide me with a good reference letter should I wish to apply for a PhD somewhere else, and said that “so long as you don’t run into another (supervisor’s name) you’ll be fine”. My secondary supervisor also offered to provide me with a reference letter recommending me for PhD study. However, they have both said this is “off the record”, and made it pretty clear that they won’t back me up if I involve them in a formal complaints procedure. Some of the postdocs and PhD students have filed complaints about what has happened to the head of section, but he made it pretty clear that nothing is going to happen. So I am wondering how to/if I can get another PhD. I do not wish to change subject, but imagine that having an MPhil will make continuing in the same subject difficult. My supervisor is sufficiently well known that most people in the UK in my field will have heard of him, and I doubt my referees will be willing to say anything significant against him. I was going to apply abroad, and hope people don’t know what an MPhil is, but am not sure if this is just a silly idea. If anyone has any advice, I would be very grateful. If there really is no point in applying to another PhD, it would be really useful to know. Thanks. TL;DR – I failed my transfer viva, but it was conducted incorrectly, and I have multiple substantial reasons to believe I have been forced out. I want to apply for another PhD in the same area, but am unsure how to go about it, and if this is even possible.

"About to graduate but feel like the academic door is closing on me. I expect to graduate in a few months. My background is in social science, specialising in qualitative methods. My doctoral journey was quite turbulent and non-linear, where I faced significant challenges related to family and mental health during COVID. I was lucky to overcome those challenges to submit and defend my thesis, passing with minor revisions. I experienced prolonged post-submission limbo, 19 months between submission and final deposit of my thesis into the university library. During this limbo period, I was proactive in promoting my research. I presented at four conferences (two national and two international). I secured an invitation to a special issue in one of the top journals in my field through this. Additionally, I was lucky to secure a part-time research job outside of academia during the first 11 months of this limbo period, doing social research unrelated to my field. The (small) organisation was happy with my performance and offered me a 0.8 FTE contract in the 12th month of my post-submission limbo. I accepted because my country has very few universities and even fewer academic job opportunities with restructuring and cuts to non-STEM departments. I need the money to pay for my cost of living as I didn't save much money from my time as a PhD student. In this role, I am getting opportunities to develop transferrable skills such as delivering education workshops, public engagement, project management, and collaboration with other organisations in the industry. In an upcoming project in Q3-4 this year, someone will guide me in quantitative analysis with administrative data and statistical software. However, hefty self-directed learning will be needed to upskill my coding capacity. I feel I need to expand my research skillset as social science, especially interpretative analysis using qualitative data, is under attack via the method of financial strangulation and having a more applied skillset may be more desirable for my future job prospects, whether academia or otherwise. It was good to have my graduation date confirmed after 19 months. Still, I have not had much luck securing a postdoctoral position overseas, the next step in my aspiration for an academic career. My stats so far are 40 applications (postdocs + lecturership), and I have only managed to progress to one interview. I have asked for feedback from hiring committee members, and the common theme is that I have a strong research profile/proposal but a very thin list of academic publications and accolades compared to other candidates applying for the position. One kind professor I contacted about sponsoring my postdoc research had let me know the standard of successful fellowship candidates in the past: 1 book/monograph, 2 - 3 articles in top journals, and academic awards are also desirable. This gave me a reality check on what is needed to progress into the next stage of an academic career and my distance from it. I am worried about my ability to actualise my aspiration for an academic career as I am constantly juggling between work obligations, upskilling my quantitative research skills, strengthening my publication list, and finding time to exercise to protect my physical and mental health. I cannot afford to quit my job to focus solely on strengthening my publication list. The significant disruption in the latter half of my PhD put me in a constant catch-up mode where my competitors for postdocs would have disseminated and published their work in that period and built a much stronger network and profile for themselves. As I am about to graduate, I may have fewer opportunities and time to further my academic profile. Therefore, my pathways to further an academic career are eroding away quickly.

"How bad is it to fail a class. Hello, I am in my 3rd semester at college, I got a 4.0 gpa in high school and took college courses, enough to have a little over 1 semester completed before entering college, while my first semester was a little rough my second semester I got all As and overall did really well my first year. I was originally a Biology major and did decent with all my classes (up until now but i’ll get to that) but i recently decided to switch my major to Finance (mostly because I didn’t really like any of the job prospects for a Biology major). The thing is is that I changed my major too deep into the semester to drop any courses. For context I have a full ride, and with this certain scholarship I cannot drop any course after I selected them, so to my problem. I am enrolled in a Chem 101 course and it is honestly the worst class i’ve ever taken in my life.

"Switching supervisors due to poor research fit? (STEM MSc/PhD program). I was wondering if anyone had experience switching supervisors due to a poor overall fit with research/career goals? I am \~1.3 years into my MSc program in STEM currently (with option to fast-track a PhD), and realized that the subject matter is not really for me, and I can't see a future in this field. My supervisor is great and the environment is amazing, which is why I decided to join this group. However, the research area turned out to be a massive mismatch from my expectations, and worries about my future in this discipline as a whole have significantly impacted my mental health and ability to be productive, to the point I have been considering dropping out or taking a leave on and off for most of my time here. I have always been a top student and had lots of research experience as an undergrad, and have won awards/scholarships as an MSc student too, but I feel like my potential is under-utilized in this field and it has crushed my drive to be in science. The ""easiest"" path forward on paper would be to finish my MSc and apply to a different school's grad program after; however, my fiancee and our home are in this city, so I cannot see myself significantly uprooting my life until he finishes his own PhD (at least 4 years but realistically more). My MSc does not open the door to any fulfilling work I could do in the interim either, mostly roles in biotech/pharma that do not interest me (and are pretty limited too). Before grad school, I interviewed with a PI in a different department at the same school, who in hindsight better fit my goals, but passed up their offer to join my current lab. I don't know if they'd even still be interested in taking me on. The field uses several skills I developed in my BSc but is pretty divergent from my current MSc research. I am going to talk to a trusted faculty member and see what they think, but I was wondering if anyone had experienced success switching labs in such a circumstance?

"Decision Help: U Miami Honors + da Vinci Scholar vs. Northwestern. hi! I’m trying to really finalize my college decision and I’ve narrowed it down to two choices: Northwestern or Umiami. I applied to major in neuroscience at both schools on the premed track, and I plan to go to med school after graduating. I’m also considering a minor in Film or Philosophy. For some context, my financial aid at both schools is almost similar, with Northwestern being 5k higher so the price while still a factor isn’t currently a major issue. Northwestern: pros - incredible research and premed opportunities - proximity to Chicago - overall community and vibe on campus feels like it would suit me more - I absolutely love the campus cons - never experienced a winter so I’m a bit scared about the cold weather (I’ve heard a lot of people talk about how it affects their mental health) - the quarter system and difficulty in maintaining a very high gpa. This is my main concern rn. While I definitely will put in the work I’m concerned that maybe this system might not work for me, and as gpa is highly considered for med schools, I’m a bit scared that it might be lower than if I go to Umiami. - I’ve heard there’s grade deflation but I’m not entirely sure if this is true Umiami: pros - cheaper option by 5k (got a scholarship) - got accepted into the Foote Fellows Honor Program, da Vinci Scholars, Health Profession Mentoring Program, and PRISM (Advanced Program for STEM majors) - I feel like the social life may be easier to balance with academics here - overall the environment appears more relaxed (tho still competitive) which I think would be easier to maintain a very high gpa - I love the school spirit cons - I’m a bit concerned that I might not fit into the community at Umiami - cost of living in Coral Gables is higher - no housing guaranteed after 1st year - not as prestigious. While I don’t mind this I’m worried this might make a difference when applying to med schools Northwestern was my top choice for a while but I’m second guessing myself now because of the GPA/more stressful environment as compared to Umiami, as well as the opportunity for Honors and additional programs Umiami is offering.

"Need advice on approach to dropped assignments. I've noticed an increasing problem in my courses, and I would love to hear the advice of the group. Background: The online course I am teaching is 15 weeks long. The graded assignments are: 14 discussions, 9 quizzes, 5 short essays, and 2 substantial research papers. For two years, I have had the following approach to late work: no late work is accepted under any circumstances, but I drop the 2 lowest quizzes, the 2 lowest discussions, and 1 essay. (I don't drop the research papers.) So, missing a couple of assignments cannot affect the grade of an otherwise good student, and I don't have to make judgments about which excuses are acceptable and which aren't. Over the last year, I've seen a growing problem that has caused me to rethink this strategy. More and more students treat the drop assignments sort of like a credit card – if they don't feel like doing an assignment, they don't, because they know that it will be dropped. The problem is that there is a correlation between the students who don't feel like doing assignments and the students who are generally weaker academically. This means that a growing number of students find themselves near the end of the semester with a double problem: they have used up their drops, but their average is still low. I understand these are choices the students are making, but I thought I would get feedback from the group on this. I'm wondering two things: (1) What are your thoughts about the wisdom of this approach in general? (2) If there are other people who are taking this approach, what are you seeing, and do you have any language you share with students to persuade them not to squander their drops?

"Is it unfair when professors sometimes commit mistakes due to carelessness but still deduct scores on your tests for petty/careless mistakes despite having good critical thinking and understanding skills. Hello, When I was an engineering student, I had various professors who, sometimes commit mistakes whenever they give examples or they sometimes explain things incorrectly. Although, most of the time, they correct themselves later on if a classmate of mine noticed our professor's mistakes and called them out. Most of these professors give four-five worded problems per major exam and they score it either zero or full points per item, no effort points, no in-between. Although I never complained and felt unfair regarding this scoring system as I knew it was for my benefit to really work harder beyond my limits. As an engineering student that time, it was always Math and technical computations. I worked so hard not to get any failed marks and I successfully did it. Now, I'm already a professor for the same engineering degree program, handling math and technical subjects in this program. I feel guilty in a way that I sometimes commit mistakes or carelessness whenever I solve sample problems in front of them. Some of these petty mistakes I sometimes commit are also being called out by some of my very diligent students after class. But I follow the same scoring and grading system that my professors were using as they always iterated that it should be the standard in our program. My students do not complain or anything but somehow, I feel guilty that our scoring system seems too perfectionist and absolute but even us, professors, being humans, sometimes commit mistakes too. I feel somehow guilty, and at the same time, I don't want to ease the existing grading system because that would feel unfair on my end seeing these new students passing without much effort whilst I worked so hard just to survive this program without failure.

"Another bachelor's in CS or an MBA or Masters in Data Science. I majored in biology at a top university and was on the pre-med track and graduated Magna Cum Laude, however I genuinely never wanted to go to medical school for various reasons, including the fact that I am very introverted, like working alone, burn out very easily and want a good work-life balance. Also I have ADHD and college killed my spirit because of how hard I had to study to compensate for my inability to pay attention and manage my time and general executive dysfunction. After graduating, I got some work experience in the legal field and also in the pharmaceutical field as a quality assurance specialist where I just processed complaints received from regulatory authorities (no phones). I hated the first job but I enjoyed the second because it was from home and because it was mostly data entry. Absolutely hated the meetings though. I got laid off back in December and I am trying to decide what to do with my life. I got accepted into OSU's post-bacc comp sci program and I took the intro to cs course which was in python. When I was getting my first degree, I consistently missed my classes and just listened to lecture recordings and studied my notes before exams. For that reason, I thought I would love OSU's asynchronous classes where we basically taught ourselves and just had deadlines. However, I genuinely hate it. All the material provided is very poor quality and just hard to understand. I started Harvard's CS50P course and that was honestly so much better. However, I also did not finish it because there are no enforced deadlines. The only benefit from OSU is the enforced deadlines. Considering the fact that I am currently unemployed and living off of savings and will have to start paying back my student loans from my first degree soon, I do not know what to do. OSU's classes are not cheap (the entire 2-year program costs 30K, and you end up with a BSCS). I am honestly looking for online programs that 1. have deadlines 2. are not asynchronous 3. provide career guidance. Also the introductory course has been making me question if I just hated the way that the program is set up or if I am just not a good coder. It's so hard to answer this question without being in a program that's better structured. For that reason, I have been considering maybe getting an MBA or a Masters in Data Science since I enjoy math and all the jobs that look interesting to me on LI require knowledge of SQL, BI and Tableau. I honestly do not know. I am tired of wasting money and years and I just do not know what career path would best suit my personality and which degree I should get to enter that career that won't leave me in overwhelming debt and that actually has a good structure that works for my ADHD. Also, I am keeping in mind the rapid advancements in AI. I really do not know. I feel so so so lost. Also I used to think that I am passionate about CS and technology but I am honestly just passionate about not feeling burnt out and having enough money to survive. Like if I could find some sort of data entry job that paid close to 6 figs, I would never want another degree. I wish I could start my own e-comm business because even if I find the perfect degree program and get accepted into it, I will still have to fake enthusiasm during interviews for internships and jobs.

"Bad first semester and transferring. I'm currently a Freshman at the University of Kentucky. I come from a small high school where I barely had to try to get good grades and easily got to rank 1 without really trying. I was also the President of a few academic clubs, founded an arts club, and was on the Varsity academic team. I applied to Vanderbilt early decision as a senior. Physics major, 31 on the ACT, sister goes to Vandy. I thought I had a decent chance. Of course, I didn't get in. So I get to UK expecting an easy ride. Didn't expect to study much and get A's/B's. I was faced with a harsh reality. I didn't study much, and my grades suffered. In Physics 1, I got a B. Calc 1, a C, and my English class, a B. In my labs and extra classes I got an A/Pass. The reason I received a C in Calc was because the grading scales that were in my online portal were inaccurate, and so I didn't think my grade was as bad as it was/didn't study much. So all of these grades bring my GPA down to a 2.75. I know, not too bad for a first semester, but not as good as I was expecting. I had the thought of transferring somewhere. At first, I considered Vanderbilt. It is still my first option. I will be applying there in the spring, for the fall semester. I also considered other schools. Cornell, Notre Dame, Washington University, Emory, Northwestern, Case Western, and Northeastern are currently the schools in consideration. So right now, I know I have a bad application, but I am hoping to improve that next semester. I am currently preparing to work with 2 professors next semester. In my learning program, it is required that we do research the second semester of our freshman year. All of the research projects they listed were not related at all to physics, so I initiated the act of creating this research class and making this research project. The project with that is where I will be making compact circuits that produce high voltages. The high voltages will be used for neutron experiments. This could possibly be beneficial to experimentalists in the labs. I will be working with him and some of the other physics majors in my dorm. I will also be working with another professor doing more outreach. He does a Physics program for kids, which I may help out with those, but I will mainly be doing projects that he will present to his class this upcoming semester. The projects are for college students that will become teachers, and teaches the students physics intuition. I think both of these projects will help quite a lot with my application, but I'm not sure if this will be enough to overlook my GPA. I'm also looking at getting involved with the school radio and am currently a member of the chess club. Another question I had was dealing with my application. If I apply in the spring, which would have an application due in February, would any of my grades from the second semester come in to play for my GPA? I don't think it would change my GPA, but does my progress grades/midterms have any play in my application? Is there anything I can do to make my GPA not so hurtful?

"The sources are cited in another comment. These pictures came next to the dictionary definition of the respective sources. First of all, I agree with most all of what you said. Second, I disagree with some of what you said. &gt; maybe we can build a larger stadium, remove the wall. The wall exists for a reason: so fans to run into the game. In real life, we have walls for real reasons, like preventing a terrorists from becoming a pilot. Moreover, in college, there is a finite number of seats in the lecture hall and a finite number of papers a professor is capable of grading. While I am all in favor of building new schools, new classrooms and new housing buildings (I did my thesis on how to build more *supply* and challenge the finite housing reality) there is always a limit. The law of supply and demand. The increased demand for perfunctory college degrees has exacerbated the already finite supply, if anything, encouraging the built-in inflation from administrative extras. &gt; why is Harvard allowed to have so many legacy students? I’m not sure with the specifics of Harvard, but I agree the legacy situation needs to be re-addressed. SCOTUS is looking into it. But not eliminated. Legacy exists because IQ is an inherited trait. However, it is not a guarantee the son will be just as intelligent as the father. For example, they could huff paint all their life, eat glyphosate soup and become a meth addict. That environmental factor would make them less like their generic parent. If the legacy is not direct parents, but cousins or grandparents, the genetics are less clear. So legacy should only really be a consideration if it’s a “tie breaker” and the student isn’t like the “mayors idiot son” who got a 20 on the ACT. &gt; the school is making so much profit This is something I have trouble with. Harvard and my school are technically non-profit schools. For-profit schools are like Devry and online schools. However, as somebody who grew up in Washington, I can tell you that “nOn-PrOfItS” are complete BS. It’s just an excuse to evade taxes. If we were all intellectually honest about colleges, then we would classify all of them other than state universities as “for-profit” colleges. Even then, some of the state schools act like for-profit colleges. There’s no such thing as a college that doesn’t care about profit — they need to make a profit in order to expand real estate assets and pay teachers to keep up with inflation. So they inflate their own cost of education, using the “dorms” and “stadiums” and “fountains” and “real estate” and “research” as an excuse to charge you your family wealth for something you can now learn on YouTube. The pandemic exposed this racket over zoom: you are paying for insight about how an equation works. The diversity consultant, leaf blower guy, snow plow guy, stadium guy, administrators and even some of the academic advisors are just extra weight. What are you paying for? Seemingly everything BUT the professor salary. It’s a racket. And it’s a racket subsidized by the federal government. People keep taking student loans to keep up with the *demand-pull* inflated costs. And who pays for those loans? The Fed. We just print money to pay banks who take these stupid loans for something they cannot afford because the price is 90% air. If Frito-Lay created a college, it would have less air than most colleges. &gt; Educate people without college I agree on this so much. Many in Washington agree with this too. That is the holy grail of politics. After we let China into the WTO in the 90s and we allowed illegal immigration for cheap labor, we basically eroded the entire “working class” from the United States. Now we’re stuck with this false dichotomy of the “professional” educated class or the “useless” class struggling to pay bills. But now even Starbucks requires a college degree because this demand-pull inflation of college. The incorrect solution to this problem was to force all of the would-be workers into college. Testing optional, everybody gets an A, and the entire generation has useless degrees that mean nothing now because graduation is mandatory. This methodology failed to factor IQ. People aren’t malleable. You cannot make a family of apple pickers into a family of lawyers in one generation. When the illegal immigrants took their jobs and the Chinese subsidized workers took manufacturing jobs, they were *forced* to go to college in pursuit of happiness… and then guaranteed this happiness. That is the legacy of neo-liberal deregulation and Reagonomics. The legacy of Bidenomics is rebuilding American manufacturing jobs, reducing built-in and supply-push inflation and increasing competition-driven economic growth. But it will be the legacy of a future administration to deal properly with demand-pull inflation of college, because culture takes decades to change. After years and years of telling our kids not to become a trash collector or carpenter… now we have to tell them to do what they are best at. College is for engineers, architects, doctors, lawyers, researchers, military officers and other specialists who need a post-secondary professional licensure exam.

"This is definitely something I personally struggled with for a long time in my first couple years of Uni. Honestly, sometimes you're just going to go through periods of exhaustion and lack of motivation. It’s part of being human and a student. It sounds like you might be experiencing burnout, which is really common among high-achieving students. Are you getting good quality sleep? You said you're taking naps, which can be great but you really need to get a normalized sleep schedule aiming for about 8 hours a night. Also, being active—whether through intramural sports, going for walks, or hitting the gym—can work wonders for boosting energy, mental health, and motivation. Sometimes also you need to break your workload into small manageable chunks. f you think about everything at once, or look at a project in its entirety, it can get really overwhelming. Break it into small chunks and set realistic expectations for what you can get done in a day or in a study session. This will give you small wins that make you feel like you're making progress. This is where productivity tools come in handy—whether it's to-do lists, calendars, or whatever else works best for you. You might have to experiment a bit to figure out what helps you stay organized. Also since you mentioned you did better when you had a loud roommate and had to go to the library, maybe going back to a structured environment like that can help. Personally when I want to zone in I always have to go to the library. Changing up your environment can help reset your mindset. If the tiredness and lack of motivation feel persistent or overwhelming, it could be worth considering whether it’s more than burnout. Depression or anxiety can sometimes contribute a sense fatigue and disinterest. Don’t hesitate to reach out to a counselor on campus for help.

"How do I explain a lack of a certain professor's reference letter in my grad school application. I worked at an university lab part-time (full-time in the summers) for 2 years during my undergrad. This has led to 2 publications with me as first author and the professor as the principal investigator. The 3rd project I worked on with him ended up becoming a start-up company with 1 other colleague. That is, the 3 of us created a start-up company together. The start-up company was doing well for about a year before business disagreements occurred, which severely damaged my relationships with the professor. Because of this, I decided to resign from the company. My colleague, however, has told me that the professor has been making accusations about me (e.g. stealing data) to him, even though he knows it is untrue and ridiculous. I now want to pursue a graduate degree but I do not trust the professor to give me a good recommendation letter. Having spoken to other colleagues in the lab, there have been cases where this professor intentionally sabotage students he does not like (e.g. sabotage the med school chance of a student who filed a complaint). When I submit a grad school application, I am sure the reviewers would be expecting a reference letter from this professor.

"Advice Needed: Transitioning to the U.S. and Choosing the Right Graduate Program. I just got married to my American husband in May this year. We are both in China right now and are preparing to settle in the U.S. soon. I plan to apply for a green card first, and then pursue studies and work. However, I'm uncertain whether to pursue a PhD or a master's degree. I'm currently gathering information and looking for the best solution, and I hope to hear suggestions from others to bridge some information gaps. Here's a bit about my background: I have a bachelor's degree from a non-elite university in China, where I was top of my class. I passed the TEM-4 and TEM-8 exams and have a C1 level in European International English, so language isn't a problem. I later went to Hungary on a government scholarship to pursue a master's degree in International Relations, where I performed well and learned Hungarian, so applying for a PhD shouldn't be an issue. In terms of work experience, I've been working in educational institutions and companies since returning to China, and I'm currently a freelancer doing tutoring. My current plan is to pursue a PhD or a second master's degree related to education. However, considering economic pressures and future development, I prefer to pursue a PhD. I previously considered a second master's in Computer Science, but after learning more about it, I realized I'm not very interested and still prefer working with children and in education, which suits my personality. Right now, my first choice is a PhD in Speech Pathology, but based on my educational background and the information I've gathered so far, it seems that applying for a PhD might be difficult. Applying for a master's might be easier, and the outcomes seem similar, but I might have to self-fund. I'm wondering if anyone has insights into this field and could offer some advice. A friend mentioned that I could prepare for both a master's and a PhD at the same time, but I'm not sure if that's feasible. I also have an alternative field, Educational Technology, but I feel more interested in the first option.

"Not a chemist so apologies for the vague advice, but I’d suggest going to lecturers/professors/tutors, fellow students or those in years above you and asking them. Those employed to do so should help you, and be able to point to different resources. I’d also recommend trying to condense the areas you don’t understand into manageable bite-sizes and questions. Is there something specifically you’ve not understood? Is it the theory or the application? Etc. It will also help you to find appropriate resources - specific topics will often be covered in YouTube vids, books from the library, online articles etc. Those steps should both help you, and help others to help you.

"MRP overcharging. I Was Overcharged Above MRP—Here's How I Fought Back and You Can Too! My Story: The Day I Paid Too Much Like many of you, I used to just sigh and pay that extra amount whenever a small shop or a fancy establishment charged me more than the printed Maximum Retail Price (MRP) on a packet of chips or a water bottle. I always felt cheated, but I didn't know the proper place to complain. Who has the time for Consumer Court over ₹5 or ₹10? But then I learned a powerful truth: MRP is the final price, inclusive of all taxes (GST included). No one can legally charge you a single rupee above it. I decided enough was enough. I found the one government body that takes this seriously: The Legal Metrology Department (LMD). This isn't just about weights and measures; it’s about fair pricing on packaged goods, protected under the Legal Metrology Act, 2009. My Simple 4-Step Action Plan (The ""How I Did It"" Guide) If you get overcharged, here is the exact process I followed to file my complaint with the LMD: Step 1: Prove It (Evidence is Everything!) This is the most critical part. Your word won't be enough; you need hard proof. Make sure you get these three things: * The Bill: Even if it’s a manual receipt, ensure the item and the illegal higher price are clearly visible. * Photo of the Product: Take a clear picture of the actual product where the MRP (Maximum Retail Price) is printed on the packaging. * Shop Details: Note down the exact name and address of the shop/establishment. Pro-Tip: If the retailer argues, try to pay and write ""Paid Under Protest"" on their copy of the bill. It shows you didn't agree to the price. Step 2: Find the Right Office The LMD is run by the state government, so you need the contact for your area's Legal Metrology office (Controller of Legal Metrology). * I Googled ""[My State] Legal Metrology Department"" and looked for the official website under the Consumer Affairs section. * I found the phone numbers and email address for the Assistant or Deputy Controller in my district. Step 3: Lodge the Complaint—It's Easier Than You Think! You don't need a lawyer for this! I used the online portal, but here are the easiest ways to report the violation: National Consumer Helpline (NCH) | Call 1800-11-4000 or 1915 | Quickest way to register a grievance and get guidance. | | NCH Online System portal | Visit consumerhelpline.gov.in | Best for formal, trackable complaints. You upload your evidence here. | | Direct to LMD | Email or Call the State/District LMD Office | If you want the local enforcement officer to take action directly. | | UMANG App | Use the National Consumer Helpline service | Convenient mobile option for reporting on the go. | I uploaded my bill and the photo of the MRP, describing the incident clearly. Step 4: Follow Up I received a complaint number right away. The LMD then initiated an investigation. They are the official enforcement agency, so they take it seriously. By tracking the complaint, I ensured the process moved forward. When a violation is proven, the retailer faces penalties. Don't let them win! Your small complaint holds retailers accountable and prevents them from cheating thousands of other people.

"Mid-life Career/Location Change at age 40 after 6 years out of the workforce as a FT Caregiver to my mom with 2 primary cancers and dementia - Grad School or. I will try to be matter of fact with the points, otherwise I could ramble regarding all the details, but I really need some input on where to go from here considering all of the following: I am an only child with no remaining family, social network, or money after living on savings and working from home as much as I could while caring for my mom for so long. It was always just she and I. Divorced, no kids. Nothing keeping me here in the US. Traveled extensively around the US, Asia, &amp; Oceania. Given that, I want to ideally work and live abroad in either Ireland, UK, Norway, Australia, NZ, possibly Canada - maybe if I stay in the US, the PNW or Maine/NH/VT/Boston - places like that. I've never been to Europe, but I absolutely love the weather (gray skies, rain, cold temps). Having lived in Louisiana and then California for 5 years, I'm so sick of the sun (which puts Aus &amp; NZ at a disadvantage, but the nature is gorgeous). I'm also not a fan of big cities, much prefer small-ish college type towns with great views, greenery, and nature. Work visa is unlikely given my career experience and degree (but if any professionals who end up reading all of this think I could be a fit in your lab or research, please let me know!): BA in International Studies with first year Biology major coursework incl. Calculus/2 Intro Bio courses with labs/2 Intro chem courses with labs in 2005, graduated in 2008 with a 3.2/4.0 from LSU - United States (I'm pretty sure my STEM courses will not transfer anywhere at this point due to age, and I don't know how I feel about having to take all of them again, trying to minimize repeating anything due to financials, time, etc.) Career path has been 4 years working at USC in Graduate admissions as a credentials analyst/Assistant Director; 2 years working at the LSU Vet School in an HR related field; a couple of several month long contract positions for Tetra Tech &amp; others in QA/QC, disaster relief, editing engineering proposals, GIS mapping, and data analysis. A stint in film production. Self-employed work in the form of my EBay business and utilizing Upwork and Fiverr for freelance work in STEM writing/editing, A.I. language influence, etc. and a couple months working for an online biotech journal in operations before my mom was diagnosed. I consider 6 years as a sole caregiver and manager of affairs/decisions/research in oncology and dementia to be very heavy hands on experience in both psych/neuroscience and healthcare honestly (given the fact I would watch entire lecture series in certain subjects on my own just to learn from afar). So I'm all over the place in terms of industry and length at each place. I've been accepted to several graduate programs (Public Health, Psych, &amp; Social Work) abroad in the UK (never been), Australia, &amp; NZ (been to both of those countries) where all programs commence between Sept. 2005 and March 2026 and federal loans cover everything, which thankfully with the new legislation, the grandfather clause will allow me to continue with Grad PLUS loans through the duration of the 2 year programs : 1) Cardiff Univ. (Wales, UK) 1 year MS conversion programme in Psychology with a 3 month work placement - begins 15/09/2025 - Federal loans cover everything, but it's expensive, and I'm uncertain about job prospects after graduation since it's only equivalent to an Honours Bachelor degree in the UK. The UK allows a 1-2 year post-grad visa to look for work after graduation, but associate psych jobs seem hard to come by and the pay isn't great from what I am hearing. I don't need much, however. I've been living on $2000/month in the US for the past year - that's enough for all of my living expenses, just doesn't allow much travel. WES will convert it to a MS for the US, but it's very much unknown if it would pass credentialing with the accreditation bodies in order to gain supervisory hours/licensure to become an LPC or the like. I reached out to them with no response, and ideally they want you to pay and have the credential already in order for them to evaluate it. I am trying to find this stuff out before even enrolling in such a program. Wales is a perk being in the UK, and I would love the travel opps and nature. 2) Monash University (Melbourne, Australia) - ranked in the top 50-ish universities worldwide. 2 yr. Master of Social Work commencing in March 2026. I was also accepted to the James Cook University MSW program in Townsville, QLD, Australia beginning in 09/2025, however, it is not eligible for federal loans due to some online coursework. In terms of timing and cost, as well as the open door to rural positions upon graduation, JCU would be a good fit because I prefer small town vibes but hate the sun and hot weather. Melbourne is the opposite - cool temps, lots of rain, great nature, still a deadly sun as is the case in NZ as well. I think the job opportunities for social work are plentiful and well-paying with a host of opportunities to work in different environments. My preference would be in aged care given how much experience I had with my mom and the terrible social workers she had. However, due to my age, Australia does not allow a post-grad visa to stay and look for work after graduation, so I would have to hope to find something while still studying or in a work placement because the US and UK would not transfer an Australian social work credential immediately or easily. The Australia/NZ bridge is a perk because Social Work extends across both countries seemlessly. 3) University of Otago (Dunedin, NZ) - commences in Feb. 2026, 2 yr. MPH in Public Health. I've never been to the southern island of NZ other than Picton, so Dunedin is in a beautiful location for me to explore. Perk of NZ higher ed is like the UK, but unlike Australia, I can get a post-grad visa to look for work after graduation. Con - I am unsure of the job market in public health for an international candidate. I'm also unsure of how it could translate back to the US if I can't find work in NZ or Australia. So those are my top 3 current graduate offers of admission. Norway had no options that took federal US loans, and Ireland didn't have any applications open for any of the fields I'd be eligible for. I have 2 other options - 1) find work in the US much like before probably working in higher ed. since that's the majority of my work experience. Healthcare seems difficult to get into thus far for me since I've been trying with no interviews. 2) STEM degree (2nd Bachelor, 1-2 yr. certification in a STEM field, science prereqs for a Master's program such as P.A. or pathology assistant) - the US is much more stringent on admission qualifications compared to abroad, not to mention my science prereqs would have expired with age. i.e. the psych and MSW programs - U.S. requires 3 LoR and a statistics course. I have neither of those things, so it was much easier to get into the foreign programs - no LoR or stats required. LoR are an issue for me - I've been out of school since 2008, so I won't have any professors to ask. I've been out of the workforce since 2018, and I only have 1 former supervisor I can easily get a LoR from. Even during my mom's illness, there is no one I could ask in hospice/nursing home/physicians areas that I am close with to request that (terrible experiences for the most part dealing with aged care, and her oncologist retired and didn't like how much research I did throughout her treatment/not close enough to the nurse to request anything specific enough). So that's my roadblock to US schooling at the moment. My interests in STEM options would be to either stay where I am in Baton Rouge and do an online program (haven't found one yet) or community college to get the science prereqs, but again I have that issue with not wanting to repeat life again. Whatever I enroll in, I would need to take out more loan money for living expenses since I can't find work where I am currently. All of that is packaged into the abroad programs. I wish I could possibly test out of the subjects for credit instead as I'm pretty much self-taught since leaving uni in science and tech. I'm also debating going to Washington state and enrolling in either Shoreline or Bellevue College to get the prereqs for UW and do a Bachelor in MLS (Medical Lab Science) - I really would love to work in a lab, away from people (which is the opposite of Social Work, I'm aware - I can wear both faces, but a lab would be my preference, although, helping aged people is a close second). A Pathology assistant, a histotech, MLT even - these are all associate degree type options that would go right into work and possibly allow me to get a work visa abroad if I'm not past any cutoff age points by then (looking at you, Australia - rude). The perk of UW is also that it's eligible for a visa in the UK which is awarded to recent graduates from top tier schools to look for work there (if I even got accepted to UW - LoR/GRE, those are all issues). So, there it is. If you read through to the end here, I thank you and appreciate any advice you have. I need to move forward, while still grieving at times, and do something I care about. Counseling and Science have always been my top interests, but I have so many roadblocks with all of my options (too many options if you ask me, that I can't nail down one) that I can't counsel myself on this situation",Faculty,Medium,1.0,reddit:r/gradschool,Medium,1,9573,1734,6,Mid-life Career/Location Change at age 40 after 6 years out of the workforce as a FT Caregiver to my mom with 2 primary cancers and dementia - Grad School or.,0

"this isn't an academic problem. It's a hiring problem. And not even a ""problem"" really. It's just what it is. MOST jobs in any industry (including academia) don't send rejection letters to every candidate. First, you're wrong. Just because it could be ""automated"" doesn't mean it's trivial. And more importantly, it's not necessarily even advisable. If I write everyone to tell them they're rejected, some subset will take that as an opportunity to write me back and know why or worst, to start arguing. And just because the applicants all have PhDs, that doesn't matter. Some people are just rude. I've literally had this happen when serving as a journal editor. I had a ton of submissions, rejected most of them. and had more than one write me back to tell me ""I'd made a mistake"" one of whom was really rude and cursed me out.

"Brand new PhD program - associated risks and what to look for. Hi all, I've found a PhD program that perfectly consists of the material and methods of what would be my ideal post-graduate studies, and am considering applying for next year's cycle. Here's the hitch: they've only just launched the program this year and the first cohort will begin in the fall. This is an interdisciplinary program (think social science meets engineering) at a top-tier institution, and the faculty are among the cream of the crop in their respective fields. Do any of you have any experience or insight into an issue like this? What can I look for over the next year as the first cohort begins that will help me decide whether or not to apply/attend as a member of the second cohort ever? I know TT jobs are hard to find these days, will being among the first class of graduates from a program make that harder, regardless of the institutional/faculty prestige associated with the program? This is one I'm particularly curious about. If you went straight through a silo'd program in any of the sub disciplines of this program at this institution you'd have your choice of jobs at the end, but the fact that it's new and interdisciplinary is what could make it challenging. There are two older threads on this sub, [one discusses a program that's ten years old](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/47ycbs/attending_a_newer_phd_program/) and [the other was more similar but had a generally positive outlook on things the matter.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/2wct57/was_anyone_the_first_class_in_a_brand_new_phd/) Thanks! edit: formatting",Faculty,Medium,1.0,web:reddit:r/gradschool:search:attendance issue,Medium,1,1644,255,6,Brand new PhD program - associated risks and what to look for.,0

"Etiquette around academic job market letters of recommendation. I'm a PhD candidate (humanities) trying to wrap up my dissertation in the next year or two. It's time to go on the job market for the first time this year and I've been in a bit of denial about it because I don't feel ready. My dissertation process has been long and fraught and I have a complicated relationship with my advisor. He believes in my project and shows that he cares by providing very detailed feedback but he sometimes takes a tough love approach to advising and his tone can come off as exceedingly harsh over email, particularly if i turn in writing that he deems incomplete or substandard. (This has created problems for me because I tend to have perfectionist tendencies anyway, so it makes it hard for me to allow myself to turn in messier sections and drafts for feedback, which in turn slows me down more.) In short, I am burned out, which has made me irrationally fearful of my professors' thoughts about me and my work ethic.This state has also led to quite a bit of paralysis about the job market. I decided to do a narrow search this year and apply for 1-2 tt positions plus some poatdocs and VAPs in the spring. In the last few weeks a TT position emerged that is basically tailor matched to my research, so it would be dumb not to apply. Ideally, I would probably want a letter of recommendation from my outside committee member, who is advising a theoretical component of my dissertation that is part of the job description. Unfortunately because I have been neurotic about communications and uncertain about the job market, I did not approach her about the recommendation when I approached other members of my committee at the beginning of the semester. (Initially my plan was to solicit recommendations from only profs in my department since they are more connected in my field.) This is totally my fuck-up - I have been so paralyzed by indecision during this burn out period that I let the fear of not being ready and of wasting her time get the best of me, even though she's been a very supportive figure in the past. The deadline for the job in question is 5 weeks away and she has written other letters for me. Would it be completely rude and presumptuous to ask her at this point in time given the circumstances? (And how would you prefer grad students to approach you in this sort of case?) Or at this point would I be better off asking another professor in my department who is on my committee? (He has agreed to write recs for a couple of other positions.) Thanks for any advice you can offer. I'm embarrassed I let it get to this point, as I'm usually really on top of this kind of thing. Clearly I've got some soul-searching to do, but in the meantime I at least want to give myself a chance at this job",Faculty,High,2.0,web:pullpush:r/AskProfessors:submission:professor rude,High,2,2807,512,6,Etiquette around academic job market letters of recommendation.,0
"Organizational advice for those who struggle to keep up with assignments. I posted this in r/college the other day and they seemed to like it, so I figured I'd share here. If you're a grad student then you probably already know this method but, what the hell, here it is anyways! I took 23 credits last year (7 classes total.) Between classes, assignments, exams, extracurriculars, greek activities, and trying to maintain some semblance of mental health, my life was a chaotic mess. The only way I survived was through rigorous organization and task prioritization. Based on my experience, here's what I'd recommend to those who are going through something similar: &amp;#x200B; **1. Create a master syllabus** A master syllabus is simply a combination of all of your syllabi in a central location. In other words, you literally take the schedules from your syllabi and combine them into one. This means due dates, assignments, lectures, exames. all of it. It may take a couple of hours to complete but, trust me, you’ll thank yourself later. &amp;#x200B; **2. Add all of your life other activities to your master syllabus** For example: study sessions, extracurriculars, clubs, sports, holidays, and everything else that you have to plan for. Don't forget to add personal time and relaxation as well. The goal is to turn your master syllabus into your personal ""holy grail"" of time management and scheduling. If you can predict it, add it. &amp;#x200B; **3. Create your master syllabus in a dedicated task management tool** I used [Taskade](https://www.taskade.com/) because it's simple and easy to use. You can schedule your assignments by date, create due dates, and set reminders. Tools like [Asana](https://www.reddit.com/r/Asana/) and [Notion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Notion/) could also work but I found them too complex. If it takes you longer than a day to create your master syllabus then you're kind of defeating the entire purpose of the exercise. &amp;#x200B; One more note, DO NOT use spreadsheets. Take it from someone who has tried. Spreadsheets get more complicated and messy as you add tasks throughout the year (which you inevitably will.) Instead of spending hours creating formulas, color coding with conditional formatting, and otherwise trying to morph a spreadsheet into a task manager, just start with a tool that's better suited for your purposes. The entire concept of a master syllabus is simple in hindsight but I promise you that if you do it right it's an absolute game changer and will save you immeasurable stress.

"MIT vs Stanford - 48 hours left, HELP NEEDED. Please help me decide between MIT and Stanford! Any opinion, any insight, and any anecdotal evidence would be MUCH appreciated. Please let me know if this sort of post isn't allowed here, this is my first time on Reddit. Cost is not a problem for either of these schools. I'm a girl planning to study either math, CS, or something related to these fields. My ideal plan is to go into pure math and eventually get a PhD but I am very likely to change my mind (my parents want me to go into CS for this reason, more versatile for finding a job in case I don't want to pursue academia). I am also interested in minoring in English or creative writing. **MIT Pros**: \- Closer to home (I live on the East Coast) \- AMAZING culture and history. MIT has been my dream school for all of high school and I have so many articles and blog posts saved of the amazing traditions at MIT. hacks, prank wars with Caltech, the weird obsession people have with poker (?) It seems like a place where I could really be happily nerdy. \- Amazing math department and classes. Some classes I'm really interested in taking at the intersection of Math and CS, like Parallel Computing and Scientific Machine Learning (18.337) and Computability and Complexity Theory (6.1400). \- So many STEM outreach initiatives! I'm very passionate about teaching math and science and MIT has so many opportunities to volunteer and get involved with that. \- Cross-registration at Harvard and Wellesley (would allow me to take interesting humanities and writing classes). **MIT Cons:** \- Super academically rigorous. As someone who went to a pretty average HS and had to work really hard in high school, I definitely am not prepared for the rigor of MIT and would have to study a lot over the summer. \- Math research opportunities for undergrads seem kind of limited? I would most likely get involved in doing applied math/CS research (which is totally fine, but MIT's math department doesn't seem to be super undergrad-focused - please correct me if I'm wrong). \- There seems to be a big quant culture at MIT. I am not interested in working in finance whatsoever and am afraid I will ""sell out"" (this is probably an irrational fear of mine, lol.) **Stanford Pros** \- Amazing location and weather \- Math research seems to be more accessible. There's the Stanford Undergraduate Institute in Mathematics with funding provided and a directed reading program where you get paired up with a grad student mentor. I could also go on a CS Theory/Discrete Math subplan. \- CS department is apparently super nice and accessible. When I spoke to Stanford students a lot of them said their reason for switching to CS was because the classes didn't feel intimidating at all whereas other Stanford departments did. \- Amazing English department with lots of writing classes I could take \- Also a ton of STEM outreach initiatives to get involved in, though I know less about them. **Stanford Cons** \- Quite far from home \- Definitely a much more pre-professional environment compared to MIT. As of right now I am not remotely interested in joining a startup/entrepreneurship/things that feel like a hallmark of Stanford culture, so I'm afraid that I won't fit in as much as I would at MIT. \- ""Duck syndrome"" and burning out. I know this is Stanford's take on a much larger problem but I've suffered from mental health issues in the past and want to avoid that in college. I certainly could be being paranoid but I feel like I am very susceptible to whatever environment I find myself in. Overall, I think I would honestly be happy at either school, which is why I'm having such a hard time deciding. I have people tugging me in both directions and I change my mind every minute. I truly don't know how I'm going to make a decision by Thursday and it might just come down to a coinflip at this point. Any advice for choosing a college or more information would be helpful.

"Others have spoken to the library angle, but speaking to curriculum, it’s my understanding that it’s really only stakeholders that can challenge curriculum at a college in any meaningful way. students can voice concerns about course content; faculty can develop/ change curriculum; accrediting agencies regularly evaluate programs (I think ours is every 2-4 years) to ensure they’re meeting requirements; the state board also has influence in some situations. So, if a student didn’t like a book I was teaching, they could complain. A member of the general public has no route to do that because they’re not enrolled in my course or affected by it, and they have no access to my course materials or services offered by the college. That being said, faculty have a lot of academic freedom in what they want to teach and how (thus modern classes where you can study anything from Harry Potter to Stephen King to comic books), so a complaint about a book is unlikely to happen or go anywhere if it does. You’re also dealing with the idea that many courses are electives - yes, you may have to take a lit course for your degree, but there is more than one to choose from.

"Bruh Swarthmore’s overall acceptance rate is 7.4% They don’t break that out, but the rule of thumb — which holds up empirically by looking at schools that do break it out — is that the international acceptance rate of a school will be roughly half the overall acceptance rate… and then half again if the school is need-aware, like Swarthmore. So you can figure Swarthmore’s effective acceptance rate for you is about 1.85%. Harvard’s international acceptance rate is 1.8%. To get a feel for admissions chances financial aid for internationals at any need-aware school, look at their common data set and compare certain numbers - Section B2 — Number/Percentage of International Students Enrolled - Section C2 — International Acceptance Rate - Section G1 — Total Cost of Attendance - Section H6 — Number/Percentage of Internationals Receiving Aid - Section H6 — Average Aid For International Students - H6/G1 — Percent of Total Cost Covered for International Students Things to look for: - Is the school’s proportion of international students lower — or higher — than other schools? - Is the school’s admissions rate for international students significantly lower than the rate for domestic students - What percent of internationals actually receive any aid? - Is the percentage of international students receiving aid significantly lower than the percentage of domestic students receiving aid? - How does the average aid package compare to the total cost of attendance? In the case of Swarthmore, for instance - The total number of international students = 231 (14%… 10% is typical for similar schools) - International acceptance rate = not reported, but rule of thumb is one-quarter of overall acceptance rate for need aware schools… so figure 1.85% - The total cost of attendance = $90,691 + $20,000 mandatory health insurance = $92,691 - The number of international students receiving aid = 78 (33%) - The average international aid package = $77,697 - Percent of total cost covered = 83% - Remaining cost = $15,014 What conclusions can you draw from these numbers?

"Letters of recommendation when I haven't been a student in 20+ years. So, just a quick bit of background here - I got my BA back in 2001 and considered applying for grad school to get an MLIS degree but didn't at the time, partially for financial reasons and partly because my undergrad experience had left me with a lot of self-doubt. I went to a good school, but I made a lot of dumb decisions and my GPA reflected it. Since then, I moved out, got a job unrelated to both my BA degree as well as the program I wanted to apply for, got married, had three kids, and basically shelved my aspirations. Now that my kids are older and my financial situation has improved enough that I have a chance of affording school, I'm reexamining my goal of getting a master's degree. The problem I have right now is that the program I'm looking at asks for three letters of recommendation. I plan on asking my current and previous employers; while neither of those jobs had anything to do with what I intend to go to school for, I know that both can attest to my work ethic and reliability. The third letter is what I'm concerned about. After 25 years, I doubt that my undergrad professors even remember me, let alone know me well enough to write a recommendation. I've been looking for some volunteer work at my local library, but haven't found anything I can fit into my schedule. All I can think of is to reach out to the admissions department to explain my situation and hope they settle for two recommendations, but I'm hoping someone here can give me other suggestions",Examination,Medium,1.0,web:reddit:r/gradschool:new,Medium,1,1560,288,5,Letters of recommendation when I haven't been a student in 20+ years.,0

"I usually start from a place of compassion, then slowly take it away over time. My belief is that a lot of these cases are where they're completely deluded about their progress and skills, relative to what is expected and a norm. I haven't had postdocs perform badly, but I did have PhD students do very poorly. HOWEVER, you have to eliminate other reasons, and provide guidance. I'll give an example of how I dealt with this. For example, I had a PhD student who never showed up on time, ever. They would overpromise then never deliver even basic things like sending a single file or paper. One day, they left for lunch (oddly, taking all their stuff) and then didn't return till the next day (late), saying they had a severe car wreck. I said, no problem; I know a mechanic who owes me a favor, and they'll fix it for free. They said no, they already got it fixed - but their car looked spotless outside(?). Adding to this, they also dress extremely unsafely and unprofessionally for a lab environment (we're talking expletives on very short shorts). They were well liked by their cohort, and from what I understood, had a stable, high income background, so I couldn't see why they weren't delivering. So, I started with the first meeting, sending an agenda ahead of time (going through organization, support, etc), and including a colleague from another department. I started with being kind, and asking about if there were any issues, etc, and how we can offer support or space, or navigation on any issues, telling them we can only help if we know; we don't need specifics, but we need generalities to give some leeway. I told them about my severe anxiety issues during college, and how I struggled at first, and how my advisor helped me. They refused, saying they're fine and the only thing is they have a long drive. I asked if I can help in other ways, they said no. I offered our psychologist's services, explaining that it was anonymous and we have money to let them use the services for free if they can't afford it. They again, refused. Then, I moved to talking about their performance, asking if they feel like they have improved, and if they feel like they're performing at a level similar or better than others. They said yes to both. I asked what they believe the goals are of our department, and they answered accurately, saying it's grants, papers, experiments, and outreach. I asked about their progress on each. I then asked about what specifically they think the average, middle of the road- what would be expected at 3 months, 6 months, and 9 months. They were completely off- they thought everyone else was doing a lot less than they did. I explained the average on each of these metrics. They were genuinely shocked. I asked if they were comfortable making some promises, here and now, about what they can do, with a build up period of one month to get them up to speed. They promised to attend some workshops, and collaborative writing and lab sessions. I also asked them to promise that they'd tell me ahead of time or if they couldn't attend. I also asked them to tell me what I should do if anyone didn't do any of these; they said they'd probably ask the person to leave. I got it all in writing with their signature, as an informal agreement. A month came and went. At first, they seemed fine; they responded with an outline for a literature review on my request in the first week, and I was optimistic. However, by the following week, they went back to their old habits. They attended no workshops, and didn't tell me anything in advance. I had another meeting with HR this time, offered them union rep attendance, and told them they hadn't attended any meetings, they hadn't worked on a single paper, hadn't shown other activities, or anything else. They made excuses, over and over, claiming they HAD attended the meeting and HAD technical issues sending me things, and I said, look, the time for excuses was a month ago. You would have been excused, if you had told me, but in this case, you're not reliable, and we're paying for you well above the amount for what a normal PhD student in this city gets, at near the median wage (65k a year). HR instituted a PiP, the union rep took notes, and within a few days, I got a resignation letter from the PhD student.

"Attendance getting me down. Hi all — long time reader, first time poster. I am a tenured, full professor at a liberal arts college. Prior to this semester, I taught only in our masters program. Indeed, we only had masters program in my discipline. Two years ago, our institution rolled out an undergraduate major, and I was really excited to work with undergraduate. I have worked in a variety of capacities for my 15+ years at the university, moving from adjunct to full. During this time, I have maintained a robust research portfolio and received great teaching evaluations. This semester I am teaching solely undergraduates. I dedicated to not grade attendance, which has resulted in only 1/3 to 1/2 of students showing up to class. I have a colleague who is constantly glowing about how great the undergrads are, and I find it hard to agree with her monolithic statement. The students who regularly attend my class are amazing. That said, some of the students who do not attend class can be really awful. E.g., students failing to come to class only to show up in office hours complaining about having to take the final at the university-scheduled time. This colleague and I have approached our teaching differently. For one thing, they required attendance, which may explain the disparity in experience. That said, she fosters more of a buddy vibe with her students. For instance, she regularly brings treats for her students to class. She also does have any exams in her course. By comparison, for the many students who are enrolled in both our courses, I am sure my class is “less fun.” This colleague is known in our department for being kind of toxic, and I know that she is trying to get under my skin. That said, I find the situation really tough. I put so much into my teaching and the experience is just so hurtful. I am just terrified of my coming evals (I know that I shouldn’t be so stressed but I am). I have a young-ish child, and daytime teaching makes a lot of sense for me. Our masters class are at night; and, emotionally, I found it really hard to teach at night. Anyway, it makes sense for me to remain in the undergraduate program, and I plan to do so.

"Can an advisor drop me from a course if they believed it to be too hard for me. What happened was a three days ago, I received an email from my dean assistant that I was dropped from one of my course since “freshmans are not required to take this”. This is still a major requirement but apparently just not for freshmans. Mind you this is less than a week before class starts and I spent over a month scouring my college scheduling site to find open seats for my required class. I found this excuse to be quite dumb and I knew that they just gave my seat to some upper class man that needed it to graduate since my seat was filled the minute I got dropped. Feeling unfair, I sent them a long email detailing how unfair and unprofessional it was for them to drop me from one of my courses less than a week before classes start and how there was little to no classes left for me to choose this late. Eventually, someone decided drop from that same class and I snatched a spot from the class again. Now here’s the worst part. I received their response to my previous email and their reasoning is that I am not fit and inexperienced for this class. My advisor claimed that I could not take a 400 level course since I haven’t even taken a 300 level course which I should have except the fact that EVERY 300 LEVEL COURSE WAS FILLED.

"Have you had any conversations with your PI about the long term plan for these projects and the expectations for authorship? In my field, it is extremely common for people to be authors on papers with their grad school PI after they graduate. There's varying levels of how involved they are in the overall project, but if they did work on the project it's still recognized in an authorship position. Your Pi is absolutely correct that ethically, they should maintain records on your projects beyond your term. If anyone, at any time, complains to the IRB about procedures on a project that occurred in their lab, the PI is liable and needs documentation to respond to the those complaints. Additionally, for much research there's an ethical obligation to try to ensure a project is finished. For example, of you interviewed people who shared personal details that may be emotionally taxing to talk about, there's an ethical argument that you're obligated to do your very best to ensure the project comes to a conclusion to honor and share their voices, not just let it flounder and have those people have gone through that experience ""for no reason"". Have you talked to this PI at all about the rationale for the relative priority of the projects? It could be that they view this project is faster to do or more likely to be successful and are trying to make sure you have at least one completed publication. Could be this project is grant funded which means they are required to maintain a particular timeline and submit reports about that progress.

For tenure faculty are expected to run a productive research group, there SHOULD be trainee authors on the papers.

"Still upset about what my professor did after one month-hiw can I feel better. Hi I wanted to ask other professors' opinions on something upsetting that happened between my professor and I. My professor works in the government and was laid off from his job. The layoffs were in the news and very public. Since his teaching gig is a source of second income for him, and I was worried about the layoffs and wanted to cheer him up, I decided to write a thank you letter to him and his co-instructor (who was also laid off at the same time), praising their teaching skills, and sent it to the school as well. My thinking was I can't help him in job hunting, but as a student at least I can help him get his contract renewed in our school, give good feedback, and provide moral support. However, my professor misinterpreted the thank you letter that I sent to him to mean that I'm attracted to him as a woman. It was very obvious because he never thanked me for the letter and talked at length about his wife when I mentioned the letter. There is nothing romantic in my letter. The co-instructor has no such thoughts. He thanked me for the nice gesture. My professor made me quite uncomfortable, and I had just graduated at this time, so I brought up the issue to clarify the misunderstanding. My professor confirmed that he was thinking this, and told me he had also thought this about another female student in the past because she kept coming to his office hours. He said he does this subconsciously to women, and he can't help doing it. He sounded very cocky and holier than thou,, if he's having to shake off women who throw themselves at him, when all of this is just in his head, which I found insulting and humiliating. Additionally, I shared my parents' experiences of job loss with him, to empathize, but he laughed at my parents' experiences of layoffs which further upset me. Finally, when we were speaking on Teams, his wife came into the room, stayed in the background with seemingly no purpose, then called out to me from across the screen that ""he needs to leave"", then forced an end to the meeting. She never acknowledged me nor introduced herself. It was bizarre, and frankly rude. My grandfather and grandmother taught at colleges. I remember they communicated with students even after they retired, with the students telling them about their careers and just chatting. My uncle had an English professor who fell on hard times and couldn't pay her medical expenses after retirement. Him and his classmates held a fundraising event for the professor and raised a lot of money for her. I was just trying to be helpful as a student because the professor had lost his job. I'm sorry to say this but the professor has a bias on a female students. He can't see them as human but as women. It is not just me but a pattern because he did it to another student in the last and he has only taught for three years. I have told the professor all of this. However, he does not think he did anything wrong. I told him I wanted to hear an apology then completely stopped all contact with him. I wanted an apology. He has not reached out to apologize and it has already been a month. I feel absolutely humiliated and miserable that I tried to help someone and was treated like a homewrecker by him and his wife. It has been one month and I am still upset. None of this would have happened if I was a male student. I feel my actions were viewed in a bad light just because I was a woman. Since then, I definitely feel worse about approaching for advice or supporting any male teacher or mentor. I became very wary. I feel he will repeat it because he doesn't think he did anything wrong, it's a pattern and he doesn't see how it affects students negatively. Could any professors here provide advice on how I can feel better and get over this.

"UW Seattle vs UMass Amherst vs Boston University. I'm stuck between these three schools, and I would appreciate any input given the upcoming commitment deadline (5/1)! I have in-state tuition for UMass Amherst (honors college), Univeristy of Washington (honors college) costs 60K after scholarships, and BU is nearly full cost (\~90k).

I'm not enirely pre-med, but I'm thinking about an MD/PhD. **University of Washington** (Honors college)**:** Pros: \- Amazing research opportunities - In a major city + PNW \- Beautiful campus and location \- Highly ranked in biochem/chem \- Private bathrooms in some dorms \- Medical school nearby for clinical and shadowing hours \- School spirit + football \- Surrounded by nature + hiking + skiing \- Can explore a new state and city :) Cons: \- Super competitive environment with grade deflation - Class registration can be difficult \- Quarter system \- Seattle weather can be depressing \- Can't go to lots of parties without being invovled in Greek life (don't plan on rushing) \- Large class sizes (even for upper levels) \- U District doesn't seem the safest - Seattle is very expensive (campus food is expensive too) - Opposite side of the country (not too big of an issue, but might get homesick) **UMass Amherst** (Honors college): Pros: \- BioTAP first year program - Solid chemistry department - R1 research university + lots of resources (less than UW) \- Honors college dorms are nice \- Not as many weed-outs/less cutthroat culture \- Amazing campus food (ranked #1) \- Pretty campus + hiking \- Able to explore options academically \- Semester system - may be easier to get into summer internships that start earlier - Will cost 100k less than UW and half of what BU costs - Fun social enviroment - Can graduate in 3 years with dual enrollment credits (don't know if this is that important to me; 4 years may be helpful for grad school applications) Cons: \- Not as ""highly"" ranked \- Slightly isolated/ not near any major city - Housing crisis - Some buildings outdated (not as pretty of a campus as UW) \- Not near any large medical schools for clinical &amp; shadowing hours - Large class sizes - Student body may not be as driven as other schools **Boston University** Pros: \- In Boston + close to home - Near medical school + so many research opportunities in Boston/Cambridge - Resources of a private school \- Able to explore options academically \- Semester system - Fun social enviroment + city location Cons: \- Very expensive \- No real campus - Housing crisis - Don't know too much about the school (applied on a whim) I think I'm leaning towards UW right now becasue of the research and location, but I'm worried about how competitive it may get.

"My college is not allowing me to visit my family. I study in a tier 3 college in India. I am a student of CS branch. There is an upcoming cultural fest in our college in which we (placement training students) are not allowed to co-ordinate the events and must not attend any other celebrations if we have placement classes. Now the placement training team has grant permission and withdrew all the classes this year in regards with the culturals. So I'll tell you about the placement classes, They conduct programming tests in 2nd year and shortlist a batch of students based on performance in coding. I was happy I secured place in the batch coming from a bio-maths stream. Then they give you complete training from the morning 9:am till 10:00 pm in the night with breaks in between. I never attended my classes, I missed attending my major papers such as DBMS,OS etc in live. All we do is to code 24/7 each day. Each day they set a target to solve problems,take tests and continuously code in platforms such as leetcode etc. No government holidays,no weekends. We go to college every single day from Morning till night. We wind up our classes by evening in the weekends (how generous). They teach data structures every single day. It is frustrating to solve the same problems and I am pushed to the point I don't have any interest in any subject. We cannot take leave during placement classes or else we will be removed from the batch or must write an apology letter. And we will be marked and removed from eligible lists of certain companies in the campus drives. We'll writing an apology letter requires the signs of the class advisor and the Higher authority and removal from batch is worst nightmare which means I must be there attending my regular classes. I got used to sitting in front of the computer for past 2 years and now I cannot absolutely focus for the whole day. I have the higher up,who never absolutely listens from our pov. He is a experienced faculty but always puts me down and never encourages me. He always thinks from his side and never understands(atleast from my experience). And he always scolds me for what my classmates did which I am completely oblivious as I am in placement classes I never go to academic classes or even in the direction of that building. I never created any issues nor failed any tests infact I'm one of the academic toppers in my branch despite not attending classes. But he absolutely puts me down whenever he gets a chance. To him I'm just a disobedient brat who doesn't respect the elders.The advice always ends when I cry. Now that placements have started and I'm very stressed. And my mother is ill and have to undergo a surgery. I want to see her. Now the placement classes have been suspended for cultural fest all the students in placements want to visit home as it's been 2 months since we met our family. And we don't know when we will be permitted to visit our homes next time. And now they won't allow me or anyone to visit homes as they claim culturals are conducted for students and we must stay back and enjoy it. I desperately want to see my family. They don't allow us to see higher authorities regarding this matter. We don't have proper food in hostel it is always undercooked.

"As someone who goes to community college right now, let me tell you. **Benefits** • Small class size: I hear about how in Uni there can be hundreds of kids in a class, forget that at CC the class sizes are similar to a high school class. My English class ended with 10 people. We started out with 25-30. My CC is notorious for hard English courses. • Saves money: You will save A LOT of money if you go to community college. My tuition is roughly $3k a semester. Plus I’m doing summer courses which is $1.6k. Add that up it’s around $13.6k to get my associates degree. At a State University you’ll be paying around $25k without scholarships every year. That includes room and board. Money talks. • Professors: Professors get to know you better and you’re not just another student. You’ll get more attention in class. •Working part time: You’ll have time to work on the side and get some extra cash. You can probably still do this at University. **Drawbacks**: Don’t look over these, because I did. •Social life: Don’t expect everyone to be a social butterfly at CC. You may not have many friends at CC. A lot of people have friends outside of CC and don’t try and make friends in their classes. This is something to take into consideration. It doesn’t sound very important until you’re bored in your house every night playing games or watching YouTube and anime (this *definitely* isn’t me). Especially if your CC isn’t in a huge city, people are probably driving from all over to get to CC. Not everyone is going to live 10 minutes away, so this makes it harder to hang outside of school. Even if your high school friends are going to the same CC you may not talk to them as much, life gets busy, and everyone changes after high school. • Other expenses: How will you get to CC? Will you need a car? Where are you getting your food? Take these expenses into consideration. You’ll probably need to work part time, or maybe your parents will help you out a bit until you think you’re ready to work. • Home life: Do you want to get out of your house? Are you comfortable being where you are for at least another 2 years? This could be seen as a benefit or a drawback depending on your situation. Lastly, try and have your major figured out **before** the fall semester. I wouldn’t be taking summer courses if I just picked my current major from the beginning. If a major speaks to you, regardless of what people think of it, go for it! Also more importantly some classes are only scheduled in the fall **or** spring semesters, not both.

I was let into the program at McGill without the credit since I graduated with and Arts and Sciences DEC, which negates that issue for application.) I had signed up for the placement examination for chem 2 this past August to make up the credit to avoid having to take the course, since I have technically completed it already. Passing this online test would grant me credit for chem 2. However, due to work and other issues, I did not end up taking the test. I was under the assumption that it could be taken before any semester, as long as I completed the credit before graduation in 4 years. However, I recently learned that McGill typically only allows placement exams to be taken in the **first semester** of one's study at the university, effectively barring me from ever taking the examination another time (as the window is only before the semester starts) and forcing me to squeeze this 4-credit class, which again, I have basically *already taken*, into my already incredibly intense schedule. Even worse, I wouldn't even be able to take just one more semester at the end to take the course, as it's only offered in Winter semester, forcing me to stay an entire additional year at the college to pursue that option. I know that I messed up immensely by not verifying that the placement test was only available before the first semester in which I attended the university. However, as chem 2 is not a pre- or co-requisite for any of the courses I will be taking during my undergraduate studies, I see no reason why taking it at another point would be an issue, as the class is simply a program prerequisite. Do you think that McGill admin would consider my case, and if so (or if not), what's the best course of action? I really do not want to have to either late processing graduation for an entire year or suffer, physically, mentally and academically, by shoving it into an already-packed winter semester in the future.

"How to deal with a “poor” professor. So I’m a senior nursing major and we have this ethics class with two professors. They switch who’s lecturing depending on the topic. This class has an allotted 3 hours but in all honesty it could be an online class especially since there’s no exams. One is great, she gets straight to point, stays on topic, is respectful to us and is usually done lecturing within 2 hours. The other one is a hot mess. She talks so incredibly slowly and says “uh” and “um” every 2-3 words. She goes off on long tangents and takes the whole 3 hours (or more) to get through a 10-15 page powerpoint. She also makes little digs at us, we do a lot of group discussion and she’ll ask “does anyone have any thoughts or is that too hard?” or say that we don’t participate but she interrupts us a lot when we’re talking. Another issue is that she likes to keep us over the 3 hours and in order to get attendance points we have to sign a sheet after she’s done, which she keeps up at the podium with her.

"Seeking advice on programs or institutes that support independent interdisciplinary research (AI ethics / philosophy). Hi everyone, I’m currently enrolled in a Master’s program in Applied Philosophy in Germany, with a research focus on AI ethics and alignment. I’m reaching a crossroads and would appreciate advice from people more familiar with the academic landscape. My core issue is fit. My research interests are highly interdisciplinary and project-driven (philosophy + AI ethics / governance), but my current program is largely seminar-based and theoretically oriented. While the coursework is intellectually solid, it doesn’t meaningfully support or integrate with my research direction, and there’s limited infrastructure for sustained, independent research at the Master’s level. I’m trying to understand what other institutional containers might exist for someone like me, particularly options that: * Support independent or self-directed research (rather than primarily coursework) * Take interdisciplinary AI ethics / philosophy-of-technology work seriously * Offer some form of funding or stipend, since self-funding indefinitely isn’t viable * Don’t require being fully trained as a computer scientist (though I’m open to acquiring technical skills where appropriate) I’m aware of the most competitive paths (elite PhDs, top AI labs, high-profile fellowships), but I’m specifically trying to learn about less obvious or unconventional options: research institutes, funded MA/PhD programs with unusual flexibility, European or international centers, philosophy-of-technology hubs, etc. I’m not asking for admissions advice or program rankings. I’m trying to get a better map of what kinds of academic or para-academic structures actually exist for this kind of work, and whether staying within a traditional university is realistically the best path.

I know most PhD students freak out over comps, but I've definitely, absolutely not studied enough for any of them. Like, maybe 10-15 hours total. I fell into a heavy depression around June due to medical problems and other personal issues and I've spent most of the time since doing almost nothing besides the bare minimum to survive in research. I know I should have reached out to my advisor and let him know what was going on, but I felt too ashamed about how bad I'd let the situation become and now it's too late. I'd be shocked if I didn't fail literally every one of my three exams and have to retake them, and I know it would heavily influence my reputation in the department and make me feel even worse. I'm furthermore self conscious because I'm medically disabled and receive testing accommodations, so I feel like it'll look even worse if I fail despite having extra time and such. The only positive is they give you a second shot at the exams, but it would still be humiliating and I'm scared I'd perform so bad they'd kick me out anyways.

"Female TT professor using gender bias as her weapon. A senior scientist in my lab has a track record of taking credits for projects she has been loosely involved in, and often when a colleague asks for her contribution to discuss authorships, she threatens to go to the university's ethics committee. She has started this whole social-justice persona few year before her faculty applications, before that, she did not seem to be bothered to call other women bi@#ch and acted very toxic in her personal relationship. Recently, she accused a former colleague with having gender biases simply because they had a conflict on authorship. I was one of the authors and I know the discussion was purely scientific, and gender never played a part in it. This former colleague who left the lab a few years ago has a stronger scientific track record, more innovative ideas, and was short-listed for a TT position at the same university as this female colleague. She was not on the committee but when she learned that he had a strong chance to get selected, she went to the dean and the dean, without verifying, red flagged this very competent colleague and he was not invited for an on-site interview. I understand the school would always want to protect their own faculty first, but in this case, removing a top candidate just because of personal conflict and false accusations seems unfair to me.

"Where do I go from here. 2/3 done with the first semester of my 4th year at college, and I'm stuck again. Last year I had major depression issues and that made me fail a full semester. Though I'm doing better, I again looking back at the 2/3 ive done so far and I essentially can't pass any of them again. Assuming I passed all of these my trajectory would be that i'd finish in winter of 2026, which is already daunting, but this means another semester add-on again. My GPA is a 2.1 and a couple of the classes this semester I was told to take to bring my GPA up to 2.5 so I could enter the CS program. Part of me realizes I never did this due to a passion in computer science. I'm good with them, love them, spend a lot of time on them, but my passion always has been music. I hate to sound like a rebellious teen but thinking about putting on a suit, working that huge chunk of my life just to help prop up someone that doesn't need the extra money. Simply doing it for money seems awful, and frankly makes me feel immoral. This really became an issue when I tried taking a computer science job prep type course, and I was required to wear a suit to events, mock interview, all the other students seemed to have something I don't, and I just don't see myself being proud of what i'd be. If I hate the system, why bother working in it, to be a part of it myself? Currently with help I'm sitting at 24,000 in unsubsidized loans, for everything up through this semester. Does anyone have any advice for me? What do I do. Do I leave this, move with my other musician friend to LA and rough it, try to make music that pushes a message, try to not live in the corporate bubble? Super depressed trying to figure things out while I sit in my dorm not attending class. This is a previous post I made a year ago for any extra context: &gt; I've been grappling with depression, and right now, things feel incredibly challenging. I'm in my third year of computer science, nearing finals week, and I haven't been able to touch my homework for a month. Last year was better, but the breakup with my girlfriend of four years in the second year left me traumatized and unmotivated. Recently, I connected with someone new, but that ended abruptly, leaving me feeling unloved and alone. My main life goal is to find my soulmate, but my struggles are affecting my ability to focus on school. I'm torn between continuing with college or pursuing my passion for music. My mental health has taken a toll—I'm dealing with ADHD, anxiety, and depression that seem to have intensified. I feel like my brain is foggy, and I'm struggling with basic problem-solving. Therapy and new meds haven't provided the relief I hoped for, and I feel incapable of accomplishing anything meaningful. Has anyone been through a similar situation? Any advice on navigating college, relationships, and mental health?

"[UPDATE] ""I can't focus, I barely do any work."" - If this is you, get seen by a professional. [Original post.](https://old.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/uro967/i_cant_focus_i_barely_do_any_work/) TL;DR of original post: Hadn't done anything but the bare minimum of work for nearly a year. Finally accepted it wasn't just pandemic or burn-out. In my OP I said I didn't think it was ADHD since screening tools highlighted lots of problems I had no issue with: Organization, punctuality, ability to be physically still. Y'all set me straight on how there are different manifestations of ADHD, and some people might have the attention-deficit aspects without the hyperactivity aspects. Some of you talked about how women and people with anxiety were particularly prone to ""fly under the radar"" due to atypical representations. I decided to try to get assessed. It was *a chore and a half.* * I made an appointment with Campus Health, paying the summer fee (ugh) only to be told that they will only do medication for ADHD if I've undergone a ""psychological educational evaluation."" I was informed that no one on campus did these and I would need to find someone and pay out of pocket and insurance probably wouldn't cover it, and they usually ranged from 600-1200 dollars. *Fuck that, my friends.* (Whenever I get the chance I'm going to advocate for having this type of professional on campus and this evaluation included with campus health services because the fact it's required to get ADHD treatment but students basically can't access it is BS.) I'd even explained that I'm in a part of my education where I have no classes, no tests, no grades, and no ""competition"" with others. There is no incentive to abuse it. But nope. * But I was *so desperate* to not crash and burn on this degree that I was willing. So I asked where they recommended. They gave me lots of places around campus. Problem: I'm at a satellite facility 2 hours away and gas is four hundred dollars a milliliter. They had recommended a place that also has a branch in my area. * I called that branch. They told me they *do* have a branch in my area but the only provider there *died* the week before so they couldn't see me. * NOW WHAT * My therapist recommended that I try to just see a non-school-affiliated general practitioner for medication, since the need for the evaluation was just the school covering its ass vs. amphetamine abuse and not required for other practitioners. * I then had to find a local GP. I set up an appointment saying I wanted to talk about getting on ADHD medication. Went to the appointment, paid the copay. * The first thing the GP says when she walks in ""I see you're here for ADHD medication? We don't do that here without a psychiatric referal."" * THEN WHY DID YOU LET ME MAKE THE APPOINTMENT * She said she'd get me the psych referral and we went through the whole rigmarole of new patient setup. Including blood work, my A1c is good, something I was curious about! Not relevant to this story, but yay all the same! * The psych referral place calls me. Its a centralized ""appointment processor"" type thing and not the actual psych office. They tell me since my deductible isn't met it will cost nearly 200 bucks to see them. I explain to them a brief version of above and insist that I absolutely *cannot* pay for this/go through with the appointment if they are not able to actually help me and are just going to refer me again. * Girl on the phone is very uncertain, has me on hold for like 20 min checking with all sorts of people. Does finally confirm that whoever I will see *can* dx and rx for ADHD. *Finally.* So I pull out the wallet again, pay, have a telehealth with someone in a different state a few days later. * Psych provider gives me a diagnosis after a conversation, recommends Vyvanse. I've heard of it since I'm a dietitian and it's also used to treat binge eating disorder. I'm not officially diagnosed with BED (I already know I don't meet a little bit of the criteria) but have impulsive and compulsive over eating tendencies, so I'm excited to try this one in particular! * Sends Rx to my pharmacy. * Pharmacy emails me there's a delay with my insurance. UGH. * Turns out there's no generic for Vyvanse so they were checking if it was covered. It is not. 75/month. Thankfully in researching allllllll this I'd found a manufacturer's coupon. (If you're on Vyvanse or any expensive medication go look for a coupon! It brought mine from 75/month to 30/month by just showing the pharmacist a website!) * Finally got on Vyvanse. Have to do my medication management through this other service and pay for it each time since despite a legitimate Rx campus health still will not help me manage this med since I don't have their inaccessible 600+ dollar evaluation. Now, having read that, consider it all in the context of *someone with anxiety and untreated ADHD on a grad school budget* having to make those calls, find those providers, jump through those hoops, and pay those fees. Our healthcare system is so fucked. Anyways. Let me tell y'all, I feel like I've got super powers. I've done so much work in the three weeks since I've been on this. At first it was *crazy*, I had zero interest in food and just worked worked worked for like three days. Once I got accustomed to it things became more normal and I had an appetite again and just worked well without over-working. My free time is structured different; a lot of times I do extra work just because I enjoy my work and doing more makes me feel good. Or I read non-work related stuff for fun, something I didn't have the attention for before. I haven't touched many of my old ""time-sinks"" like WoW in weeks. I also only eat when I'm actually hungry and find it easy to eat an appropriate amount, I no longer am a boredom eater or mindless snacker like I used to be. ##**TLDR of this post:** Bent over backwards and side to side and up and down to get ADHD meds. Worth. The moral of this story is even if it's *a absolute slog* and the most frustrating thing you can imagine, if you are having issues that even *might* be ADHD, please pursue it. Treating it will make you realize just how much of a handicap you were working with all this time, and will feel equally validating and empowering.

"Undiagnosed ADHD in grad school. Hi all. I am currently a first year masters student in statistics and am having a terrible time, which I believe is due to undiagnosed ADHD. In undergrad, I actually got by quite well. I studied math and felt like I knew what I was doing. I did the homework (albeit last minute), and did ok on tests. Compared to my peers in the classes I took, I usually did worse, but felt like I was much more knowledgable than them and knew how to solve most problems. My best friend is studying to be an actuary (basically stats/probability), and I am often explaining things to him and helping him out, even though he had WAY better grades than me. Now, Im in grad school, and am really struggling. I do all the homework, I go to the classes, and I feel like I actually understand the material. But, when I take the tests, I end up doing way below average. The worst part is, I know how to solve the problems. In statistics specifically, I know all the PDFs/CDFs/MGFs, I know where they come from, I know the relationships between distributions, I can derive some of them, I know when to use what properties and what methods, I have an alright grasp on probability theory, I know how I would go about proving the CLT, I've been doing calculus for 4+ years and can take derivatives/integrals; basically, I'm pretty confident I know what I'm doing I think. And then I fail the exams because I'm so stressed out and anxious and can't finish problems. I get half way there, and then jump back and forth during the test, and end up getting only 75ish% of the way there. I usually don't get the partial credit I think I deserve, and I do terrible. I just don't think I have enough time to do the exams because my brain is so haywire and all over the place. I can't articulate my thoughts properly on paper. If I had the professor in front of me, I could literally explain how I would go about solving each problem. The thing is though, in applied math, you are usually either right or wrong. They don't really care if you ""kind of"" got the answer. You either get it or you don't. I will take complicated derivatives or integrate something and forget a ""+"" or a ""-"" sign and get the entire answer wrong. I have literally put things like ""2-3 = 6"" on a test before because I can't focus apparently (this is almost every exam, by the way. Almost every single time). I have a friend who has ADHD and is accommodated, and he thinks I almost definitely have it. I don't really care if I do or don't, but I know that if something doesn't change then there's a chance I could fail out. This is pretty sad, because like I said, I know I deserve to be here and can do the work. Unfortunately, employers would never understand my predicament simply from looking at my resume, so grades are a pretty important metric. I fear that my poor grades will prevent me from getting employed as a statistician (in addition, I somehow haven't been able to get an internship, which is beyond me.I know the math and can program, but apparently am not ""good enough"".). Anyways, I don't really know what to do. I could study more, but I honestly think the difference would be marginal, since I would still be making the stupid mistakes I always do, and still wouldn't be able to answer all questions in time. Last semester was a constant cycle of severe depression and normality, and I can tell this semester is going to be similar. I think I get a concept, answer hard questions and am feeling great, and then get a 45 on the exam, despite knowing literally all the material! I mean, are you kidding? The thing is, most people with ADHD or similar disorders are diagnosed really young apparently, so if I really had it, then wouldn't I have been diagnosed? This kind of thinking leads me to believe that maybe I'm actually just not cut out for math like I thought I was. Sorry for the rant, but I didn't really know what to do since no one really understands what I'm going through. I figured maybe people in similar predicaments could shed some light.

"The comments to this post are precisely what is wrong with academia and are so frustrating for people like me. For some reason, academics believe they are somehow separate from politics and social and public discourse even though the entire institution is inherently tied to those things- the US has made that clear. Academics have the highest level of education and literally spend their lives studying a topic but some how they are not capable of making political decisions about those topics? Uninformed people make life changing decisions everyday - it would be great if we had people who actually knew what they were talking about involved in these changes. Academics really expect politicians to read and understand all the research about a topic that is paywalled without input from the people actually ingrained in that work? If Trump has shown me anything, it’s how spineless and selfish academics are. They will bury their heads in the sand and watch science and higher education die rather than stand up and fight. Perhaps it’s privilege or elitism, but your publications won’t protect you if there is no funding for research and few people attending university. OP is right- academia needs to change.

"One year vs 2-3 year major. Sorry for the long post, I just really need help After three years in college, I still haven't found a major I want to do. I'm tired and frustrated of constantly switching. I have a wide variety of interests, including culinary arts, writing, history, photography, handcrafting, fitness, interior design, and real estate. I always knew I wanted to do real estate, which is why I'm currently studying for my state exam and plan to go all in. I want to open up a bakery in the future. A relative even offered to pay for culinary school because they know how much I love to cook and bake. However, I want a degree to feel safe in case things take an unexpected turn. I recently spoke to an academic advisor who was very helpful and give me a perspective of what she believes I'm looking for, she was right. We discussed how I have many interests, but they often end up being things I would rather learn on my own, like the ones I mentioned above. I don't want a job in those fields; I've looked into the job prospects, and none of them catch my attention. They're just subjects I find interesting and would rather explore them on my own. My advisor showed me majors that I can finish in a year, allowing me to pursue my goals, like real estate and opening a bakery shop. One of the majors were humanities with a focus in business administration (not a general business admin major). Knowing it lacks networking, opportunities, and job prospects. It makes me rethink the major and pursue one with better outcomes. I've also considered a specific business majors, but I never enjoyed learning about supply/demand — it was boring and overly complicated to me. Yes, I've been told to major in business, but I'd rather learn from scratch and go from there. Now, I’m reconsidering it just to get it over with, but that would take another 2-3 years to finish. Time that I could be using to build my business. Now, I don’t what to do, finish the one-year major that lacks prospects and start my passions or finish in spring 2028 with good outcomes, then begin my journey. Another option, I could complete the one-year major and then pursue culinary school afterward. My point is, I can learn my interests on my own and I know after I graduate, I won't really use my degree. But I guess I'm scared to drop out of college without proper education and pursue my dreams. I want to secure a safe option first before I start my journey. I don't even know what to do anymore, it's overwhelming and stresses me everyday.

"Getting motivated/avoiding burnout in the semester from hell. Hi all. I'm in my fourth year of coursework in my combined MA/PhD program in the humanities. I used to post on this forum a ton in my first year, when the culture shock of grad school was really impacting my mental health, but gradually got used to things and ended up enjoying myself for the most part. This year, however, I feel like I've been hit by a train. My department has a reputation for being extremely intense, and a large part of this is due to their unreasonable requirements. We have an inordinate amount of coursework, about a semester-1 year longer than most programs in my field, and i'm finally (thank god) approaching the light at the end of the tunnel. When I'm just balancing teaching and research, I actually have a great rhythm going and can thrive while also maintaining balance. I've made this work during summers. However, this semester, I'm truly in over my head and I'm not sure how to make it through and meet all my deadlines without having a nervous breakdown. Essentially I've got the following things going on: &amp;#x200B; 1. 2 seminars and a pedagogy workshop to do reading/work for. One is a history seminar, which involves around 600 pages of writing and a book review every week, so I have no wiggle room to slack off when other weeks get busy 2. I'm the instructor of record for a section of freshman composition. My university doesn't have their shit together and basically gives us no guidance or oversight as to how to approach teaching this class. I designed the syllabus and teaching materials myself and am also essentially teaching myself the pedagogy I need to actually teach academic writing. Even when using online resources, the prep work that teaching this course takes is insane. Last year I taught a foreign language, which was easy and fun because we had a textbook and associated materials that a professor in our department had put together. 3. My program requires us to submit a capstone project (essentially a draft of an article that could be submitted to journals for publication). Typically we submit it at the beginning of fourth year and then give an academic talk on it in the fall. My advisor was useless during this process; even when I set up appointments to meet, he gave me little guidance and it took him a month to get back my last draft. My entire cohort got sort of lost - no one explained to us how to actually get the dumb thing approved, or when, so we are all behind, but I'm struggling to get the piece finished before my talk in a few weeks and finding my time limited thanks to points 1 and 2. 4. To make matters even more fun, I take my quals at the end of the school year and am supposed to be putting together my committee and my reading lists right now. I've managed to be fairly productive on that, but there's no way I'm getting anything else done before my talk. My department is also making me take a seminar while I'm studying for quals, which seems incredibly unfair and counterproductive to me, but ""it's the way things are"", so I can't change that. This semester has passed like a blur so far and I'm burning out. I teach super early, which has screwed over my workout schedule, so I'm not moving enough, and I'm also operating on a lack of sleep, which leads to serious issues with my mental health. That has resulted in symptoms of depression, which I had mostly managed, to return. I find it incredibly hard to focus after 7 pm or so, but really need to be pushing myself to work later. Unfortunately, I'm starting to burn out, which affects my productivity levels even more. Last weekend, I only managed to accomplish a third of the things on my to-do list, even though I took breaks to take a walk with my friend. Tonight I was supposed to grade a stack of papers that I'm behind on so I can focus all my energy on research stuff, but after dinner, I literally was staring at my computer doing nothing. Not even interesting procrastinating. This has been happening more and more the more stressed out I get. &amp;#x200B; Usually when this happens, I find ways to cut corners so that I can get the most important things done and done well. However, this semester, there is literally nothing that I can cut corners on. I'm at a loss as to what to do, but know if I keep continuing at this pace, I'm going to burn out completely. I'm panicked about the article, which I had thought was in ok shape when I turned it in for comments. I'm not sure how to fix this problem. Even when I make schedules, it's hard to stick with them in the evenings when I'm exhausted. &amp;#x200B; TLDR: My schedule this semester is absolutely insane. I'm finding it next to impossible to juggle my coursework, teaching, and the super high-stakes deadlines I'm facing, but am not sure how to be more productive.

"Students ignoring emails. Hi guys! I’m back again with more of a question than a rant. I teach a first-year gen ed course online (asynchronous), so I see a LOT of AI use (about 33% of submissions). My college’s AI policy is to email the students to give them a chance to explain before submitting a formal report. However, I have had about 40% of my emails ignored by students. The students that ignore my emails are the most obvious cases of AI use.

"Why are the instructors so terrible. I'm on a teaching assistantship, and I keep getting paired with instructors that are really just awful. We teach the lower level and gen ed courses, as that's the part that's most understaffed, so the department throws its TAs in that direction. Still, I do a good job teaching, and put extra effort into it because my subject is important and the kids should learn it, even though they want to blow it off. Most of my students come out saying they had a really good experience, that it was difficult but valuable, and many come back to my office hours in later semesters. They don't hate me. (and I'm a tough grader.) The instructors, on the other hand, are very low quality teachers. They rely on online homework to a fault, religiously enforce very strict policies at the expense of student learning, and have a generally nasty and standoffish attitude towards both myself and the students. They can't explain the material at all, and quite often teach things that are *blatently wrong*. I'm constantly finding myself cleaning up their mistakes by re-educating the students by email and once they get to my discussion. There is no pride whatsoever on whether or not they are teaching or managing students effectively, and the thought that that should even be a consideration seems to be laughed at. Most of them don't have PhDs, so I suspect the problem is just that they don't really know the subject all that well, despite working here for 20 or 30 years doing the same thing. I get that some people don't find it worth the effort to teach well at lower levels, but the way these guys handle it seems over the top to me, and I can't help but wonder why they're still around. Not that I want their job (I'm here for the PhD), but I could definitely do it a hell of a lot better. How has nobody better come by and replaced them in all this time? Their shittiness can't be a mystery to the department. There are frequent complaints from students and parents when instructors enforce ridiculous policies - for example, one of my students got a 0 on an exam and had to drop out because he broke his leg on the way there. He had a doctor's note and everything (and a broken leg) but the instructor refused to let him do the retake, even with me campaigning for him. Their bullshit is also reflected in the (public) student evaluations. The University has to know. I'm at a top 40 university, so I expected better. I'm sure the students do too. Anyhow, that was a little ranty, but do any of you other grad school have similar experiences? Do any of you know how is it that these guys are getting by with such a persistent low quality level of performance?",Academic,Medium,1.0,web:reddit:r/gradschool:search:complaint,Medium,1,2691,489,0,Why are the instructors so terrible.,0

Look, as hard as it is tell them, this are not the only two classes that you are goin to fail in college. Last year I was in the very same situation, thought that I was not made up for this college stuff and when I told my parents that I failed like 50% of the classes they were super mad, as well as I was super mad to myself. Truth is, this second year I also failed 50% of my classes, but this year is when I found out that it’s completely normal, I’ve talked with people that are on higher grades and on the first two years you are gonna screw up A LOT. First year was much more harder to tell them tho. First time failing, etc. But there isn’t any other way around. I believe you still have the recovery exam? (That’s how it’s called in Spanish lol).

"not vibing. Hey, I’m a 22-year-old 3rd-year MBBS student. Even after three years, I still feel like I don’t really have friends. During clinical postings (9–12 AM), we’re divided into groups of around 15, and I consistently face issues with my group. The people around my roll number are often mean or dismissive toward me. I feel invisible most of the time. They don’t inform me about attendance, and sometimes they mark it without even telling me, even when I’m standing right there. No one communicates with me beforehand or includes me in anything related to postings. I’m usually left out of conversations, updates, and basic coordination. Over time, this has made me feel isolated and ignored, even though I’m physically present with them every day. i don't even have a guy friend.forget a boy now all the girls with whom I was friends with r just leaving me. it's not the same how it used to be.like nobody believes when i say I'm facing these difficulties especially when it comes to friendship or just having a guy in my life. that's so not genZ I just dont get enough opportunities for which i can communicate with my fellow batchmates.i do face a lot of other problems like I study in private college and everyone around me is super rich rich while I'm not ig.

"To the OP, If you do that well academically, then you should have applied to all the top universities - which most students pay very little tuition at these schools. For example, at Harvard no one pays tuition, even the billionaire babies. All the top universities are wealthy enough to hand out massive financial aid packages. Direct student loans are not part of the federal student loan program. They are private loans made by banks and therefore will never be eligible for loan forgiveness even if you perform public service. You have few rights with direct student loans other than 5 years of forbearance during times of financial hardship. A bachelor's in psychology isn't going to set you up for very good employment prospects. So you will likely go straight from a bachelor's to a master's program. Be prepared to take out additional student loans in excess of $40,000, unless you obtain scholarship money for graduate school. Financially you are better off attending community college and then transferring. You might be eligible for more scholarship money. An alternative is to get a job at a university and then become eligible for its tuition reduction program, which in many cases is nearly a 90% reduction in tuition costs. There are also many private scholarships that do not work within the university system directly; you have to apply directly to the scholarship. Some cover full tuition. It would behoove you to retake your SAT and get a higher score. If that means delaying school for a semester then that makes much more financial sense in the long run. At least you have that option.

She was sweet and really helpful. During this one however. Her temper shortened even more. She would snap at random moments like when a student asked her a question she didn't like. On one occassion she even started yelling at a friend because he chose to do his thesis with a teacher she's on bad terms with One day she broke down in class. She said that the other professors were ""waging war"" at her and applying pressure until she quit We were all supportive. We gave her hugs, we talked to her and even wrote a letter of support. This did calm her down enough to continue the lessons normaly but she started writing every student off that didn't show up, no matter the reason unless it was super serious like attending a funeral She even told one guy to stop attending her class because he went to see a speech two other professors gave. Students aren't obligated to be faithful to one professor or the other. Doesn't she understand that they might find topics other than the ones she teaches interesting?

"Questions Regarding Intended Degree and Re-Admittance. I (26m) have been out of UTD (University of Texas at Dallas) ever since before COVID struck, so around 2019. I had to leave for many reasons, most of all due to deteriorating mental health. It's taken me until recently to recover from severe burn-out and depression, but I think I'm ready to go back to school and finish the degree I planned to earn: a Bachelor of Arts in Game Design. But I'm stalled by two major issues: 1. **Is a Game Design degree viable? If it's not, what degree plan should I pursue instead?** I've heard stories both saying it is and it isn't, but I've always kind of felt like this degree seems, in a word, ""fake,"" or at least not a very impressive degree to show off to prospective employers. At the time, though, I thought it was perfect for what I wanted to do for a career. However, I'm already more than halfway finished with my degree plan, and many of the core classes I've taken can't be transferred to other plans. I plan to specialize in the narrative design aspects of game design (dialogue, story, worldbuilding, character writing, etc.). 2. **Am I still able to continue where I left off? Or do I have to start from the beginning?** Assuming I can even get through the whole re-admission process, I'm not sure if I'm allowed to resume attending UTD where I left off in 2019. I don't know if I can handle starting all over again, financially and emotionally speaking. I'm not sure of who to contact or where to go to even start the process, honestly. What I do know is that I'm really tired of working retail and the food industry. It's not something I want to do with the rest of my life--it doesn't really engage me creatively, and it doesn't leave me with enough time or mental energy to do the things that do engage me. I guess I'd just like opinions, advice, different perspectives, etc. on the matter. Thanks for reading this far. **TL;DR: I've been out of UTD since 2019 studying for B.A in Game Design due to mental health problems.

Cons: \-You have to apply separately for the computer science, mechanical engineering and biomedical engineering courses and acceptance is not guaranteed. \-I couldn't change to some engineering careers in case I wanted to change. \-They say they don't help you as much when getting a job compared to other universities.} University of Minnesota: Pros: \-It benefits a lot from its location which provides many job opportunities \-I really like the cities where the University of Minnesota is located. \-They have a good quality of teaching, well I have not read complaints on reddit. \-They let me change my career if I want. \-I just need to maintain a good average to enter computer science. \-Very good at research. Cons: \-It is very cold \-I don't know how good it is in other engineering fields because for undergraduates they are only ranked in 2 \-The social life there doesn't appeal to me much. \-It is not as well known as the other 2 universities \-I feel the vibe more ""off"" than the other 2 universities that are in theory more ""alive"".

"Do people pick colleges based on religion affiliation. My wife’s nephew is a sophomore and he was telling her and I how he wants to go to a Christian college. That’s his only requirement. Recently he’s been attending life point church which is non denomination in our area and he got a job to take photographs on Sundays for that church. And I guess he’s really into it which is good. My view on church is if you like it, that’s great, just don’t tell me I’m going to hell because I’m not one of you. Me personally, my parents pushed the academic side and prestige of the school when selecting colleges to apply to. I’m not my dad or mom so I don’t want to poo poo my nephews dreams but looking at some of those private school tuition made me wonder if he needs to refine his criteria.

We’re in Virginia but I’m just a little bit worried that in that he might be picking a study that might not have the best return based on the colleges he’s looking at. I think one of the school he’s looking at is Messiah in Penn and it’s 50-60 a year. EDIT: My wife took him to an open house for Messiah College and while he sat in on one of their biblical studies class, he met a professor that taught a photography class and he ended up talking to him for an hour. My wife did ask him“If you major in biblical studies then what’s the end game at the moment?” He chuckled a little bit, kinda shrugged and said I dunno. I’m just a sophomore he said. When I asked why don’t you major in photography/media/digital media my wife said Messiah didn’t offer that major.

"Processing my discouragement. Kind of a rough morning, seeing as how my hands are bleeding after slipping on the ice this morning (thankfully my laptop is okay and my body took the brunt of the fall.). It has been tougher for me this semester, the second semester of my grad school program in Biostatistics. I actually pulled off a 4.0 GPA my first semester, but the material this second semester is even more difficult and right now I'm working on problems where I give them my all and I just cannot figure out why I'm not solving them. I'm a little older also, 37 years old. I gave up my engineering career which quite frankly I hated, and I know I'm on the right path now. But fuck if it isn't a lot harder than I hoped. I never really had to know much or do much as an engineer (I actually felt quite strongly that a high school graduate could do my job), but now I'll be expected to know things, expected to have all the answers. People in industry will look to me as the one with the masters degree and who should just know the answer to these very technical questions at the drop of a hat, and that prospect kind of terrifies me, to be honest. I dunno. I'm also on a bus right now where the driver is pissed off and honking at everyone and yelling at this dude for not wearing his mask properly (which I'm glad he did, it's just the other guy isn't taking it well and he's making a scene and it's getting tense.) oh and my first big exam tomorrow. I'm as ready as I can be for it but I'm afraid it will be a disaster and spoil my enjoyment of school.

"Should I write my CS exam tomorrow and get a very bad grade or postpone it to next semester to have more time to prepare and write more exams. I think that sums it up quite well. I am terrified of the exam, so much so that knowing I could study and get a good grade paralyzed me so much the last entire week that I did not study at all. Instead, I wasted 10 hours daily at the library scrolling youtube and reddit. Perfectionism is really killing me, I'm so pressured and at the same time so ashamed of myself. So, I can either try the exam tomorrow and get away with a bad grade (which I cannot re-take/change later), or I can skip the exam and write it next semester along with two other exams that I am already postponing (and the exams that come next semester). Me being scared of studying is such a huge problem for me that I feel completely overwhelmed and chained.

"Almost graduating and I am at lost: some advice. Hello everyone! I am a BSc Psychology Hons student who will be graduating this summer and I'm feeling TERRIFIED because I have absolutely no working experience (I did not apply for an internship or placement year) nor any volunteering experience; I also haven't been participating much in societies or extracurricular events other than a language evening course throughout my 3 years of university, solely because I've been too caught up with my school work and kept on procrastinating on making future plans. I'm not even sure if I want to pursue a career in Psychology (most of the modules I chose were cognitive psychology or decision-making psychology related and none specifically on clinical psychology), and I don't know how I should find a job after I graduate. I have some plans to go a year abroad to study at a language school in April 2026, and I was hoping that between that time and now (July 2025 onwards) I could try and find a 6-month internship or gain some part-time job / volunteering experience, but looking at the application requirements I don't seem to meet any of the jobs that are being offered - the internships are mostly aimed at year 2 undergrads whereas the currently offered part-time jobs or volunteering opportunities seem to all start in May/June but (1) I'm still finishing up my dissertation, deadline being May (2) I won't be in my country between June~July. This is making me stress even more because I wonder if I'll end up finding no opportunity and no experience before I leave for studying abroad, wasting a whole year overseas and becoming even more likely to be unemployed when I come back because I will have an unexplainable gap in my work experience (not that I have any in the moment.I was thinking of trying to get a part-time job during my study abroad but that can't be guaranteed).

"Actuarial And Financial Maths in DCU or Actuarial and Financial Studies in UCD. I’m a 6th year student( F17) in Ireland (equivalent to a senior in high school), and I’m really unsure of which choice to put first on my CAO (which is a college application system for undergrad courses). I know i want to do something in realm of maths and because of my interest in financial maths I believe actuarial maths would be perfect. But i’m struggling to make a decision. Firstly, there is Actuarial and Financial studies in UCD, which requires me to get 613 points in my final exams to get into the course (the max is 625). It’s a well respected and lively campus, with 40000 students. It is a very big campus, which I quite like, however it is two bus rides away from my home and an approximately 80 minute commute. I also worry that since it is located in the more advantaged side of Dublin, I may struggle to fit in due to my disadvantaged background. Where as, Actuarial Maths and Financial Maths in DCU requires 578 points, and offers a paid INTRA placement in your third year. It is located a 20 minute walk from my house and is a big campus but not insanely with 16000 students. However, I am conflicted if i would like to go somewhere so close to home as I may fall into old habits that i’m hoping to defer from in college. DCU is more maths based and UCDs course more business based.

"Forced to host athletic recruits. So my roommate is on the track and field team at a D1 school. The team has been planning to host some high school recruits, and my roommate offered to host two herself, having been told that the recruits would be given hotel rooms paid for by the athletic department. Her job would have just been to show them around and make them feel at home, essentially. However, yesterday morning, she and the rest of her team was told by their coach that all the hotels nearby were booked and that the recruits would have to stay with their hosts, most of whom live in student housing with at least one roommate. Come to find out later that night, the coach knew all along that the recruits were going to stay with the athletes, and he blatantly lied to them on a Sunday morning, when the school is closed and no complaints would be able to be made. My roommate says she signed a contract and took a safety course in dealing with minors, but me and our other roommates signed no such contract and did NOT agree to having two underage people sleeping in our student apartment who we’ve never met before. One of the team members, a girl, had to host a seventeen year old boy. Does anyone know if there’s any ground to stand on in making a complaint to the athletic department or a different department?

"Getting a job at a national lab: how to overcome the lack of specific expertise. A couple of years ago, I left my academic career in physics after many years as a postdoc and have been working as a software developer and researcher for a biomedical company. I have been trying recently to get a job in one of the two 'national labs' (as one might call them) that are in my city with no luck so far, and previously I had applied for quite a few jobs in other similar institutes elsewhere. Since the topic I studies in academia is not particularly practical, none of the jobs are on topics that I have strong experience with, though often the technical skills involved are things that I have in abundance. What has been frustrating is that my applications have actually led to quite a few final round interviews and in almost all of these cases I was actually given feedback from the hiring (in five cases relatively long phone conversations). The reason I was not given an offer has been the same each time: ""we were very impressed with you as a candidate and think you would but in this case we decided to go with somebody with more direct domain knowledge"". A couple of times they told me that they sure I will have no problem quickly adapting to the new topic but they would of course prefer somebody who does not need to adapt. They have always said that there is nothing obvious I could have done better in the interviews. I think we can all understand them giving the jobs to people who have worked directly on that topic and I have no complaints. However, I feel like even though the hiring committees for these jobs get excited by my CV and will want to talk to me, there will always be people with direct domain knowledge and they will always be preferred. So my question is, what can I do to get around this? I'm stuck in a bit of a catch-22 situation since I can't really get any significant domain knowledge until I get a job but I won't get a job without it.

Hello, I am going to be a freshmen in college next year and am thinking of going through the process to apply for an accomodation to recieve single housing. I suffer from IBS, Chronic Gastroentitis, Chronic Esophagitis, Chronic Constapation, and Derealization. My college's dorms have 2 kinds of bathroom suites, 4 people to 1 bathroom, or 2 people to one bathroom. Or a single with a private bathroom. Im thinking of applying for an accomodation so that I can recieve a single and a private bathroom. My condition basically requires me to be able to access a bathroom at any given moment in the first 3 hours of the morning and quite frequently later in the day. Im in pain daily for nearly the whole day. My mental condition i'd just have to suck it up on that, I'd rather not recieve any sort of pity for that. Would it be selfish to apply for a single dorm via an accomadation request? I don't wish to possibly take the spot from someone who needs it more than me, but I also understand my condition is extremely hard on me. If I didn't get a single, I would room with my long-term Girlfriend who understands and helps care for me (We already live together).

"feeling lost career-wise. I probably won't be saying anything differently than other people with the same feeling, but I don't really know what else to do. I'm a current undergraduate physics major coming up on the end of my first year. I know that, without a doubt, I love space. It's been something I have been interested in since I was a kid, when my family toured JPL in Pasadena and I was immediately fascinated. Since then I've dabbled in a bunch of different academic interests, some publicly and some I didn't share out of concern that no one would take me seriously. Outside of astrophysics I am equally as interested in anthropology/classical history, and have also always dreamed of having a career in Hollywood (doing something behind the camera, writing, directing, etc). I grew up in a middle class military family, with a disabled parent and two younger siblings. We didn't have the time nor the resources for me to explore non-academic/athletic endeavors, and I was never explicitly told that this was a plausible path for me to pursue. So, I leaned toward the STEM route. To clarify, my parents never told we that I wasn't allowed to enjoy learning about these things; I just developed the understanding from a young age that my parents would not be interested in anything that wasn't impressive on paper. I come from a long line of blue-collar factory workers in the midwest. There are two people in my family (immediate and extended) with a college degree, and hardly anyone ever moved out of the state. Needless to say we're hardworking people, but there's no room for creative endeavors in any serious manner. For a long time a set my sights on museum studies/anthropology in the hope that I would one day be the curator of a museum, or get to study historical sites and newly unearthed civilizations. I could spend hours reading up on cultural myths and their connections to historical events, on the ways societies rose and fell over and over again. This will always be fascinating, people will always be fascinating. I also took great joy in watching and studying movies, learning about the behind-the scenes magic, understanding a writer's thought process when crafting a story. I would write snippets of dialogue I'd come up with on a whim in my notes app and go back and revise them, adding more, deleting some, developing a story. And I'd do nothing with it, because who am I going to tell that I wanted to write movies; that I wrote stories and released them under an alias, which I would never admit to. That I wrote essays analyzing films I watched just to think about them a little longer. That I registered for film classes and photography classes ""for fun"", but really in the hopes that I would learn and be inspired regardless of whether or not I would ever get to do anything about it. I decided on the plausible, most likely to be successful option: a STEM degree. Like an unnumerable amount of people in my generation, there's a massive culture of cynicism we are developing into adults surrounded by. It's hard to feel optimistic about anything when the current presidential administration--that we have spent the majority of our young adulthood being subject to--is pulling the rug out from under so many of us. I love my field of study, it's true. But just as much as I love astrophysics, and I am afraid of taking a risk and being left with nothing to build my life upon. This term I chose to split my classes halfway between STEM classes and history/film, as an experiment. I wanted to test myself, to see what really brought me the most joy and filled my days with meaning. I know that physics is hard, I'm extremely familiar with how nonsensical it can be. But on Mondays I start my day dreading my 50-minute physics class and looking forward to my two-hour classical history lecture. For my film class discussions, I spend an hour forming my analysis and writing notes in preparation just because I'm so excited to discuss our weekly film's meaning and interpretations. I get excited to start my homework for those classes even if it means I have to read for two hours, because it never gets boring. I when it comes time to do my physics homework, none of it is enjoyable. I spend hours making sense of problems that just leave me feeling stupid and confused. I recently took a trip to LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory) In Washington with my school's astronomy club. I was initially very excited to go, because not only is this is a possible career path for me, but it's rare that astrophysics feels tangible and accessible. I watched a documentary in advance, I researched the staff, I was desperate to learn more. But when we arrived, I felt nothing. I wasn't excited, or necessarily bored, but it didn't spark anything in me. We left after a brief tour and that was that. It was just a weekend I went on a school trip. I was left with this growing chasm inside me, feeling that I'd made a mistake. Maybe this feeling was just the realization that I simply didn't want to work for LIGO, who knows. But maybe it wasn't. Maybe somewhere along the way I took a wrong turn. It reminded me of William Shatner's trip to space, in which he expected to feel some sort of cosmic connections between all things upon see the entirety of planet, but upon seeing the great Blue Marble from outside the atmosphere, he felt only dread. Like we were wasting time. It was that same harrowing feeling I felt upon leaving LIGO, sitting in the backseat of a twelve-person van, feeling nothing at all having just stood on the ground in which proof of gravitational waves was recorded for the first time. I know that if I stick to it, I'll probably genuinely find joy in my STEM courses. I didn't choose to major in physics on a whim, I did it because I know that I find space fascinating and I love to learn about it. But after this trip, there's an emptiness I feel knowing that I could be doing something else that I enjoy right now. That I feel curiosity and fascination toward now. I feel anxious and alone constantly, because there's not a single person in my life that has ever expressed such a profound feeling of possibly having chosen the wrong path. I can't figure out which is my career and which is the hobby. I am so lost. I guess what I'm looking for is advice from others who have maybe experienced something similar, or might have suggestions of a first step.

Go for it. I emailed two random professors during my PhD. One was in Australia and I had a question about a paper they had written 8 years prior which I knew was going to be part of my qualifying exams. I literally called him at 8:00 p.m. my time and he picked up and was gracious enough to have a conversation with me for over an hour about it. The other was a professor in the Netherlands whose work used as a big portion of my dissertation and I found a mistake in one of his papers. I spoke with him and he was awesome about it. To be clear the mistake was just a clerical error with units but still he took time to talk to me about it and we're still friends to this day,Academic,Low,0.0,web:pullpush:r/academia:comment:exam,Low,0,675,138,0,Go for it.,0
"How To Catch Up On Math Before Switching Majors To Something In STEM. Hey, I'm an English major living in the Midwest and attending a school that has a shit math program (like it was rumored to have been put on probation). My economic situation has changed due to familial issues, and now I have to be a major support to my family. My plans with English have dried up considering the hellish state of finding an adjunct professor position that doesn't keep you on poverty wages, and I'm looking to switch back (I started college in CS) to a degree in STEM. The only problem is I haven't touched any serious mathematics in a good two years, and my last grade was a C in Calc 1. The school would start me off in Calc 2 if I switched back, which is something that sounds terrifying given my school's reputation for math. But I know I have to do something other than English if I want to reasonably support myself and my family.

"&gt;I'll probably be staying in dorms until I find a cheaper arrangement. If there is a commuter school that is the same price as these schools you are looking at, and your parents will let you continue to live at home for free (or relatively cheap.) Then it will probably be cheaper to own a car and pay insurance than rent/dorm. In NY suburbs, one months of rent can be a years of insurance for an older car. Factor in maintenance and gas, and you probably pay 3 months of rent to use the car for the year. Having a car also opens up more potential job opportunities. If there are no commuter schools nearby that are good/affordable or your parents won't let you continue to live with them, then this is obviously not an option. &gt;So what do you guys think? Will it work? I was able to graduate with $9,000 of student loans that I took out partially because I was helping my parents pay bills and I bought a new, used car for $7,000 my last semester for my internship. My original car was very beat up and was not a good first impression for showing up to clients at. Definitely possible to graduate without many/any loans. &gt;Am I better off taking nursing immediately as I get into college? I am not sure on what you are asking. If you want to be a nurse, yes. If you plan on taking a degree that requires many years of education (bachelors, masters, doctorate.) and it is in the medical field, I would also say yes as nursing will help pay for the masters/doctorate. &gt;I'm willing to spend five years in college to get my degree without loans but will I possibly be spending more time? **Loans aren't bad.** I believe an entry level nursing job should pay at least $30,000. By delaying your graduation date a year you are missing on a years worth of increased salary. If you want to assume it will take x years to find a job, you should assume it takes that same time frame to find a job after taking an extra year to graduate so you still miss out on a year of 'good' pay. Time is money and all that jazz. If anything, with the summer/winter courses you should graduate early! If you can graduate even just a semester early I feel it would help yourself out tremendously. This years graduates have not yet applied for positions and last years graduates are getting tired of applying so you have a smaller competition. Further, companies doing year end review are in a good position to identify if there is room in their budget for more people. &gt;Should I ditch having a dorm entirely and start looking for roommates now? Depends on rent cost and that value of your 'stress'. Roommates can bail out, leaving you with the check. If you can't make that, you get stressed out and do worse in school. Landlords can raise rents. Landlords can stop renewing an apartment. Unless you are both highly resistant to stress AND renting is significantly cheaper than dorming, I don't think it is a good option. &gt;Should I be wary of my college's financial aid, can I depend on it? My sister was awarded a full ride and then received another letter a few months later stating that they were retracting the offer as it was a mistake. Short of that I have never heard of an offer that was not made good. My biggest advice here is to ensure it is actually a scholarship/grant. Most financial aid that was offered to me were loans. &gt;I'm not much of a party/football type of guy anyways so I just want to do everything efficiently. I worked full time going to a commuter school near my parents house. Tuition was $16,000 a year. I had a half scholarship from H.S and some AP credits. I worked full time at jobs ranging from receiving in a retail store to being a cook to a paid internship as a programmer. My pay was only ~$10 an hour though. I did not pay my parents rent, I just continued helping out around the home. Cooking dinner when I wasn't working at night, yard work, computer repair etc. Some more pieces of advice: Choose a major Know what classes are required. Look ahead years to see what days/times they are available. Don't fill out your humanities right away. As you go up the chain in your major, each class will have fewer and fewer options of days/times available so you want to be as flexible as possible. By doing as many required classes as you can earlier, then filling out with humanities, you ensure you have as much flexiblity as possible. This also preps you to ensure you can continue working. When I knew I had to start taking classes that lasted until mid-afternoon I started looking for a job that I could continue working full time. If I was not planning it out, I would have had only 2 months to rush around trying to find a job that could give me 40 hours a week only being available from 4 pm - 2 am. Figure out how many more credits you need. This goes hand in hand with the one above. If you are in your junior year and see you need 33 more credits, you can finish that up with 2 full time semesters and a single summer/winter class. This is better than delaying graduation for another semester and taking only spring/fall classes. Research your professors. For me, working full time I did not have time to do H.W. I would specifically look for professors whose grades were entirely based on tests/projects to keep my grades up. Projects typically were long enough that I could find time on the weekends. But a Tuesday/Thursday class that assigned H.W on tuesday due on thursday?

"Asking for an opinion. Hi. I’m an EU student and in September I’m starting Year 2 and my uni has decided on doing blended teaching, i.e. online lectures with 3 hours of person to person meeting. This could change depending on the situation in the UK, either going completely online or more in-room classes. The thing is, I had to cancel my tenancy contract because the first installment needed to be paid by the end of July, which to me seemed really early and kinda risky, considering the fact that we have no idea if there will be another lockdown (either back home or in UK) before the end of September as things could turn worse again in fall. So my question to you all is, do you think it’s worth it, doing the first semester in UK or staying back home (therefore saving some money) and doing the first semester online while working and just go back to UK in January for the second semester.

"Got student evaluations back after first semester teaching- I’m absolutely gutted by what they said. Need advice. I’ll keep this as short as possible- I’m a TA at a decently sized school( about 12,000 students). My job is to teach a few labs as I pursue my masters, in exchange for free tuition. Anyways onto the issue- basically this past semester was my first semester teaching college students after I graduated with my bachelors. Course evaluations came in from the last semester and I just read mine. The actual tests scores and ways most students felt about the content was fine, the biggest complaint on that front was that I was not always the quickest at responding to emails. What’s concerning me are two of the student comments. They basically said the class was great, but they thought I flirted with a few of the girls and making inappropriate comments about age. (The only thing I could possibly imagine this is referring too would be me asking the class if they are all freshman, and a few people said they were my age or older than me, and yet they are college freshman. But I never made any remotely sexual comments.) I also at the end of the last class just told students that if they wanted to add me on any socials they could- as I wasn’t there professor anymore. I now understand this was a wrong choice-my intent was to reduce the tension in the room, but I way misjudged (I went to a much smaller school where this wasn’t odd to have a professors contact info or socials so I thought it would be the same here. ) I’m absolutely gutted. I guess I got too comfortable with the students since they were closer to my age than I expected, but I don’t know how to proceed. I have a younger sister that was assaulted by a teacher at her school. I would NEVER put a student into that kind of position. I take my job very seriously and have even had witnesses brought in when meeting with students one-on-one to avoid any issues of this sort. I’m sometimes not the greatest at reading social cues, or understanding what’s appropriate to say in certain situations. But be that as it may be, I don’t think that’s a valid excuse for me making people uncomfortable. I suppose my question is now, how do I continue in the next semester and avoid this issue happening again? I feel like the only response I can have is to be less friendly and more strict with how I conduct myself around students-especially female students. Does anybody else have any ideas or advice? I feel absolutely awful about those comments and want to take that criticism and apply it accordingly to my classroom conduct.

"Accidentally Didn't Waive Rights. Hi everyone! I am in a messed up situation right now and was looking for some advice. So I recently applied to two different grad schools.

Starting at a big state school in the spring and realized during orientation that my dorm is literally on the opposite side of campus from most of my classes. We're talking like a 25 minute walk each way, and I have back to back classes sometimes with only 10 minutes between them. I've been looking into options but everything seems either too expensive or impractical. Regular bikes get stolen constantly here according to the subreddit, scooters are banned on campus sidewalks, the campus shuttle is always packed and unreliable.

"Dorming is officially ruined for me. I apologize in advance for the ranting. So let me start with the background of the situation. I am a sophomore but this is my first semester at my new school because I transferred after last year. I know that a small percentage of people like their first year roommates, but you have to believe me when I say that I was living with the two most awful, unreasonable, and overall nasty people you can think of. I was argued with, yelled at, and even threatened all because I wanted to be able to get enough sleep. I got my RA involved countless numbers of times, but all she would say was to ""respect each other"" and figure it out. I'm a level-headed and reasonable person, but telling that to someone with no morals obviously doesn't do anything to help. I would be woken up at 2 a.m. by our room lights getting turned on, once when I had a 7:30 a.m. final that morning, and my roommate would blast her music as loud as possible to the point where it could be heard clearly all the way down the hallway. Still, nothing was done for months. Finally I was offered a different room, but this was only 5 weeks before the end of the spring semester. By this time I had already submitted applications to new schools. A lot of my decision to transfer stemmed from my awful dorm experience, and to this day it still frustrates me the way it was handled by the school. My second room had great people and made the rest of my time there tolerable, but I still wanted to get out of there as fast as I could. Fast forward to this year. At first I didn't even want to live in a dorm anymore. I'm a very independent person and I wasn't feeling too good about being put back into a random pool of potential roommates given the situation I was in last year. However, I met some other transfers at spring orientation and I was really excited that one of them would be my roommate. Orientation was a little over 24 hours, and my orientation group, all transfers, got really close quickly. Everyone was really friendly, which is something my school is known for. However, there was one girl in the group who, although she was very nice, was already getting on my nerves by the time we left. She spent most of the orientation talking about herself, and she had an opinion about EVERYTHING. I decided that it was probably just a one time thing and didn't think too much about it afterwards. During orientation we all agreed to be randomly placed as roommates, but that we would all request to be housed with other transfers so we could all be together. There was an immediate bond between us because of our similar situations. A few weeks later we got our rooming assignments. I was placed with the girl who had gotten on my nerves within 24 hours of knowing her. I'll call her C. At first I went into the situation with a very positive feeling. We were able to meet up over the summer, which was really pleasant. We also found out that our friends from orientation were going to be living a room over from us. I was so excited to finally have a good roommate and know people on my floor and have the college experience that I see other people having. Looking back, our situation didn't start off as good as I thought it was. C moved in the day before me, and had already claimed the bigger closet and the dresser that wasn't hard to get to. She had already spread her stuff out all over the room, including the spots that were supposed to be mine. Her bottled waters, for example, were on my dresser. At this point we were still friends and I didn't care enough to ask her to move them. For the first few weeks things were generally fine in our room. Trying to be friendly and non-confrontational, I let a lot of things go that, looking back, I should have addressed right away. She wouldn't use headphones. Ever. Even if I was sleeping. Her boyfriend, who lives only minutes from us, would be over all hours of the night. She also made a lot of rude comments without thinking about them, like once when my boyfriend told me I was smart and she yelled ""No, you're so dumb, kill yourself."" When I later confronted her about this comment, she said that she didn't even remember saying it, but it stuck with me to this day. Another problem she had was leaving our door open when she wasn't in the room and I was gone. Our door can be unlocked so that you can walk back in without needing a key, which is really helpful for things like using the bathroom or taking a shower when you have to leave but its inconvenient to bring keys. C, however, would instead leave our door wide open and leave for extended periods of time. Personally I don't care if she wants to leave her stuff vulnerable, but when my laptop and DSLR camera are sitting feet from our open door, I have a problem. Our school is pretty lenient with the guest policy, so strangers are able to wander the building and aren't questioned, and there have also been thefts by students. I don't think it is unreasonable to ask that if she was leaving the room for any amount of time that the door at least be closed, not even locked. At one point she even left our door wide open and left the building for hours. Anyone could have walked it and taken whatever they wanted, and since my stuff is closer to the door it probably would have been mine. The most obvious problem, however, has been her having alcohol and drugs in our room. Neither of us is 21, so obviously I don't want to be blamed should someone find those things in our room. When I brought this up with my RA I was first told that nothing could be done because she had no solid evidence other than me telling her that it was there. At one point C told me directly that she had pot on her, but my RA was still unable to do anything because she ""hadn't seen or smelt it"" herself. Frustrating to say the least. To be honest, I didn't want to say anything to her at first because I didn't want to look like a nagging bitch of a roommate. I don't like to confront people, and I didn't want to start issues with her and make her feel like I was nitpicking her every move. But there was a lot of stuff she did that either got on my nerves or was just disrespectful to me and my space. I finally got the courage to talk to her about a few issues I was having, but I would ask her to do or not do something and she would be doing or not doing that same thing again the next day. I literally asked her 4 different times to wear headphones while I was clearly sleeping. I decided that I needed to do something, so I went to my RA. Considering that my RA last year was a joke, I was so happily surprised to find that my new one was incredibly understanding and genuinely wanted to help me. After telling her my story she even said that although as an RA she wasn't supposed to pick sides, she definitely had my back. She encouraged me to have another conversation with her about what was bothering me, and eventually we met together with her. It was decided that we needed to rewrite our room contract, because the first time we did it I was the one writing everything down while she didn't show much interest at all. Our first contract was also very vague because at the time it was written I figured that whatever problems we had we could handle them on our own. Obviously not the case. Anyway, we talked prior to redoing our contract and decided that we would each take some time to think about what we wanted to be included so that neither of us would feel pressured into something we didn't want and we wouldn't forget anything. I took this new contract very seriously, seeing it as a fresh start for our room and by this time needing some serious changes in the way things were going. I went over every question and wrote out what I would want to see, expecting some compromise when we actually talked about it. When we got to the meeting, C hadn't prepared anything and just sat there while I read off my list. My RA kept encouraging her to voice her opinions but she just sat there saying ""I'm just here to do what sammywhammy52 wants."" Eventually I just stopped talking because I was so uncomfortable. I didn't feel that anything I was asking for was unreasonable (use your headphones when I'm sleeping, let me get enough sleep, send your boyfriend home at a reasonable hour on school nights, give me a heads up before you sexile me so I don't get locked out without my books) but I left feeling like I had asked her to be my personal slave. Apparently she didn't feel too great about it either because although she was given every opportunity and even encouraged to disagree with me and instead she just sat there and said she was fine with it, she told some friends of mine later that night that she was not fine with most of the things I had suggested. I felt like I had spent all that time and effort for nothing. The next step was to meet with our RA and now our RD, who was now fully aware of the situation. We made our contract again, this time with both of us contributing and compromising. We both got some of what we wanted, and both walked away relatively happy. I was feeling better thinking that finally my stuff wasn't going to get stolen and that she wouldn't be touching my things without asking. Turns out I was wrong, and since then my frustrations have continued but for the most part I have tried to be civil and just deal with it. My sleep hasn't been getting interrupted anymore, but new issues have come up. For example, I keep a pitcher of water in the fridge that we rented together. C has her own pitcher that sits on her desk collecting dust. Until a few weeks ago, I wasn't aware that she had been using my pitcher without asking. It sounds stupid that it annoys me, but it's mostly the fact that I made it clear that I wanted to be asked first before she used my stuff and she was doing the opposite right in front of my face. It made me wonder what other things of mine she was using when I wasn't around. This didn't become a huge issue though until she drank from the pitcher, without using a cup, right in front of my face. I should have said something, but at the time I was so shocked that I didn't even know what to say. I later asked her to wash the pitcher and refill it, but I don't believe she ever did. That crossed the line for me from things that are annoying to things that are unsanitary and just not ok. Still, I let it go because I didn't want to restart drama and tension in the room. Throughout all of this, I have maintained a twitter account which I post to multiple times a day. Last year neither of my roommates had a twitter account and didn't give a shit enough about me to see if I did, but if they had they would have found a ton of posts dedicated to venting my frustrations about them. At the beginning of the semester C created a twitter account, but deleted it a few weeks later. Once things became really frustrating with her, I slowly fell back into the habit of tweeting about her, thinking that since she had deleted her account that she wouldn't see them. And in a weird way, I almost wanted her to see them. Obviously this seems really stupid to me now, but I thought that maybe if she saw my tweets about how annoying she was that she would finally understand and I wouldn't have to keep asking her everything multiple times. Anyway, she reactivated her account a few days ago, and since my tweets were public at the time, she saw everything. Honestly, I don't feel like anything I said about her was that terrible, but I understand that in today's world something that wouldn't be given more than a talking to about if said in person is considering cyber-bullying and harassment if it is posted online. I was called to meet with my RD immediately, asked to spend the weekend off campus (even though I've been very sick this entire time and it has put a damper on my ability to get homework done), and today was moved to a completely different room on campus. I have told everyone involved that I am more than willing to continue living with her in our room since it is inconvenient for either of us to be changing rooms right now with finals coming up only a week from now. However, I have been told that C is not fine with this, and so here I am, typing this post from the commuter room that is usually saved for students who need to stay overnight on campus for some reason. This is the beginning of my frustration. I am trying to be civil, although it is definitely awkward and tense in our room. She isn't, but yet I am the one who is getting moved. I understand that I am the one who created the posts, but if she is the one who is so angry and thinks she might try to fight me then why shouldn't she leave? The other problem I've been dealing with is that this girl is at least as guilty as I am, if not more. I overheard a conversation she had today on the phone with someone (because she didn't think enough to even leave our floor) where she talked all kinds of shit about me and said things even worse than what I tweeted about her. Also, I opened our fridge and there is an empty bottle of wine laying in the bottom. Of course I texted my RA what's been going on in my absence, and her reply was that because the bottle is empty that there's nothing she can do. I'm not saying that any of that excuses what I did, but I feel like it's pretty unfair that I'm being treated like a criminal for making fun of her but she's literally doing things that are against the law and nothing is happening to her. At this point we are supposed to go before a conduct board of our peers on Thursday, at which point they will decide what sanction I will receive. From what I've been told it won't be anything extreme, most likely some sort of apology note or some work with an RA. Mostly it just bothers me because other than the tweets, I am the victim in this situation but it is being treated like the other way around. I am a good student, I was nominated for the same conduct board that will be seeing our case, and this type of thing is not typical for me at all. I'm feeling so many things at the same time, and I don't really know what do to or feel or say. I guess I'm just looking for some advice or some encouragement from anyone who has experienced something like this. Again, sorry for the rant.

"I use AI for everything even when I’m preparing for exams. I don’t think using AI is bad at all. It really depends on how you use it. AI is a tool for smart work. If you're using it to understand concepts better, structure your thoughts, save time, or improve clarity, that’s not cheating, that’s being efficient. The key is not letting it replace your thinking, but using it to support your thinking. For example, creating a resume manually can take hours, formatting, wording, keywords, structure, etc. Using AI tools like [**https://aielevatedcv.ai/**](https://aielevatedcv.ai/) makes the process faster and smarter. You still provide your experience and achievements, but AI helps you present them better. That’s just working efficiently. The same applies to studying. If AI helps you summarize, explain difficult topics, or test your understanding, that’s a smart way to learn. Just make sure you still understand what you’re submitting. Don’t feel guilty.

"Saving money as a grad school student (tips and tricks). Hello all, This is a topically relevant topic and something we are all curious about - how to cut expenses and save up during graduate school. As an international PhD student in the US, here are some tips and tricks I use to ensure that I can make ends meet while also maximizing my savings. Notes to keep in mind: \- I do not own a car but use local commute (buses) every time. \- I live in an area with comparatively moderate COL (although rent and expenses keep rising yearly while our stipends don't or barely match up with inflation). \- I have lived with roommates for the last three years. **TIP #1** **Sharing an apartment** **with roommates:** I know living with roommates can be overbearing at times (it is for me too!) but sharing a space with other people not only brings down the cost of living for me, it also allows me a much-needed space to communicate and relax, especially after a tedious day of research. On average, I save about $400-600 a month by not renting a studio or a one-bedroom apartment for myself and living with two other people. By ensuring that I room with people who are on the same page as me in terms of policies around shared spaces and general etiquette, the living situation turns out to be a little less overwhelming (problems persist at times; when it does, we try to talk it out). **TIP #2** **Budget:** Personal budgeting is my single biggest friend. Apart from the rent and utilities, I budget for everything else. I generally use Walmart, and have a general sense of what I would buy for the next two weeks, which I keep adding to my Walmart cart. If my budget for the next two weeks is $100, I will add and subtract products from my cart unless I can bring my total cart value under $100. I hop on a bus, shop, and take an Uber back home. Saves me from getting unnecessary stuff that I do not need by getting into the process two or three days in advance and adding or subtracting products from my cart over two or three days until I can bring the cart value under my budget. **TIP #3** **Meal Prep:** Meal prepping has been one of those facets of life I had never considered in my first year of grad school, but it has been an unexpected blessing. I meal prep for 4 days (only dinners), having to only cook two times a week. If I am cooking on Sunday, I am covered till Wednesday dinner. For lunch, I generally go for low-effort meals; it saves time and money while allowing me to enjoy the luxury of freshly cooked meals. (Sandwiches are my go-to; cheap, flavorful, and take less than 15 minutes.) **TIP #4** **Use bank sign-up bonuses and apps that allow for cashback when you shop:** Many US banks offer sign-up bonuses when you open accounts or credit cards with them (you need a valid SSN and direct deposits made from your payroll for this!) and apps offer additional cashback when you use their portal to shop online. A quick and easy way to make some extra money on the side. This income is taxed; however, it is ""free"" money. **TIP #5** **Going out on a budget:** I enjoy an outing every now and then. At least, I used to. These days, an outing with friends is generally a potluck. We cook some of our favorite meals and gather around. Same enjoyment with a fraction of the cost. I also take advantage of free events hosted by the university to socialize with people. **TIP #6** **Thrifting:** Utilize thrifting for clothes - healthy for the planet and saves you a bunch of money. **TIP #7** **Subscriptions:** I have no recurring subscriptions. One of the most beneficial subscriptions for graduate students is Amazon Prime and Netflix. For Amazon purchases, I plan them out as I do with Walmart and get the total cart value above $35 every time I need something from Amazon. And these purchases are not impulsive either - I buy shampoo, toothpaste, and other essentials in bulk; the cost upfront is larger, but if I have to use it over the span of the next 3 months, why not get them together to save on delivery fees? For Netflix, I share the subscription with my two roommates. You can also get by without the subscription and resorting to a VPN and you know. **TIP #8** **Passive Income:** I will sometimes review people's SOPs and profiles for graduate school admissions or work on Fiverr as a content writer since I have a lot of experience in both. However, time constraints have stopped me from doing this as much as I would like. (And no, I am not looking to review SOPs and profiles right now.) **TIP #9** **Scholarships/Fellowships/Grants:** Keep looking for those. Many universities offer short-term internal scholarships, fellowships, or assistantships to students that can even offset a part or whole of your tuition fee for the semester. I wished somebody had provided me with these tips and tricks before I started grad school; however, I write this in the hopes of someone benefiting from these. This is a tiring third year of my PhD program and all of this is written down from my own experiences. I am curious to know if there are other ways people are saving money. **TIP#4** is a very efficient way to rack up vouchers, sign-up bonuses, and cashback, making my lean wallet just a tad bit fatty every now and then (you can leave a comment here if you want to know more). Also, making sure to budget and using a dedicated app for it always helps! Edit: Since some of you reached out to me about how to open a bank account for bonuses, I understand how one might not be familiar with the process. I don't want to make this a promotional post, so please DM me in case you're wondering how to proceed",Hostel,Medium,1.0,reddit:r/gradschool,Medium,1,5631,1025,9,Saving money as a grad school student (tips and tricks).,0

Even if I tell the first two top choices I have a tight timeline, they can’t hurry the other candidates to come and interview quickly. Are 3rd choice being unfair for giving me a tight timeline?

"Quitting this week. I’m throwing in the towel. I cannot do this anymore. I teach mathematics at a large university in the North East. I’ve been here a little more than 20 years. Last week, I received notice I had violated policy by denying a student’s use of modifications granted by UCSD, our disability office. I was not contacted for any information before this determination was made. UCSD staff accessed my Blackboard shell and interviewed the student. Based solely on the student’s word, they issued their finding. The offense: I refused to let him have extra time on an in-class activity ahead of his final this weekend, which is online and to which he is entitled to his extra time. The student was supposed to bring their workbook and the formula sheet we’ve been building all semester for an in-class review and practice. This student has previously come with these materials. Wednesday, he did not. He asked if he could come to office hours later. Unfortunately, I do not offer office hours on Wednesdays because our building closes at 4:30 and my last class lets out at 4:15. We are not allowed to meet with students on campus after hours. Class let out at 11:30am. By 1pm, I had received my notice from UCSD. The notice stated: - I had violated the student’s right to extra time for assignments - The student has been informed he has 72 hours to pursue the review of his workbook and formulas sheet - After that is done—which cannot be done until Monday at lunch—he has 72 hours to complete the final, which was due noon Saturday (yesterday). When I pointed out the nature of the activity and that it was not graded, I was told “that does not matter. He felt anxiety so he gets his extra time.” Now, all semester I have worked with this student to assist them getting through the class. This includes meeting with this student twice weekly and a five minute debrief after every class session to make sure he understood the material and what needed to be done. This has included a Zoom session on a Saturday to meet the 48 hour requirement on an oral exam. In the meetings leading up to the review, I reminded the student he needed to bring these materials to class. He didn’t. And I got accused of violating his modifications. The resolution: a memo saying “If you give the student his time, you haven’t violated the modification.” After documenting every interaction I’ve had with this student and showing them records of our conversations about the formula worksheet, UCSD staff admitted I had done everything I was required to do. They also agreed the activity was not eligible for extra time modifications. But none of that matters. “We already told the student they have the extra time. So you have to give it to them. Otherwise, he could file an OCR complaint against the university.” If I stand my ground on this, which I am being encouraged to do by my department chair and my union representative, I risk further action from UCSD, which can file a formal grievance and expose me to a post-tenure review. But neither the department chair nor union representative are willing to step in because they don’t want to be exposed. The next step is a sit-down with Human Resources to discuss “remediation and corrective action.” At the very least, I’ll have a warning letter in my permanent file saying I violated the student’s rights and violated university policy. I have a pristine record, and my teaching reviews have been in the top 5% of all teaching faculty for at least 10 years. My RMP is 4.5 with more than 100 ratings. I’m popular with students and always have to make room in classes for extra bodies because my classes fill up fast. None of that matters. Not facts. Not performance. Not popularity. It is never enough. I did nothing wrong but I have to accept a letter and sign a form admitting I have. So I’m done. I’m retirement-eligible, but I will only get 40% of my current salary. And I cannot start collecting that money for six years because I am not old enough yet. My partner thinks I am making the right decision, even though I’ll have to work longer than I had planned to in some other job. Instead of retiring at 65, I’ll have to work until I’m 71 to have access to social security. Luckily, we can get insurance through my partner’s job for now. Teaching has been my entire life.

"Middle Class Student Complaints. A little background on me. I became somewhat middle class in 2012. And yes I remember the exact year because 1. It was the worst year of my young life and 2. My family was poor before that time. Not living in an apartment for more then 2-3 years, knowing that eviction notices likes to come in red and pink most of the time, walking in 80 degree heat to the grocery store. I’ve lived with family members while my dad slept on friends’ couches when he and my mom split. My dad still takes 50-60 hours of work a week.

Please miss me with that. I shared part of my story not to be like “woe is me” but to put into prospective that these things are so so real. If it’s “easier” for poor kids than it absolutely deserves to be that way. EDIT: I also wanted to add that they also get the fees which can end up costing the amount of one year of tuition.

"Institution name on my publication was incorrect/outdated. Will it affect my chances. Hello. I am applying for masters (specifically at the University of Toronto and a few other Canadian institutions). The problem i’m dealing with is, I co-authored a publication with someone in my department during the time I was doing an internship there. However, I was actually a student at U of Toronto during undergrad while I was simultaneously doing my internship and working on this publication. Thus, U of Toronto is included beside my name as co-author on this publication. I ended up dropping out of UofT and transferred to a different institution. Thus, the name of the institution beside my name on the publication is incorrect and outdated. I am wondering if it’s worth mentioning this on my application or just not mention it at all.

"New PhD student tackling lit review (how am I supposed to access all these books?). Hi Professors, I'd like to ask how you went about this problem when you were a wee little newborn PhD student like myself. I'm beginning my literature review right now. Fortunately, my dissertation is building upon my MA thesis — so I've already read a substantial amount of the works in my field. Woohoo! But now it's time to branch out and read the rest of what's been written about my subject. It's fairly niche so there aren't zillions of books &amp; articles out there. but there are indeed about 40-50 left on my must-be-read list. Here's the problem: These niche books aren't readily available in libraries (I've checked WorldCat extensively). Most are older and out of print. It's looking like my only option is to buy them through used book dealers online. But even at the cheap price of $20-$30 per book, that shopping list is going to add up quickly. I fear it's going to cost me an arm &amp; a leg. Here's what I've tried thus far: - searched for scanned/digitized files online (found a bunch this way!) - read academic book reviews to at least get an idea of the argument (this is risky, though) So, what do you recommend?

"Epigenetics is not a very cut and dry issue though. It’s nature versus nurture. And compared to the past we’ve come a long way to the point where individuals who have never experienced the level of racism that occurred in the past act as if they are currently living in those times, which is counterproductive. At some point we have to distinguish between genuine fear of racism and socially engineered fear based on social media and the like. Perpetuating such fears is akin to a village fear monger peddling superstition. Is racism superstition?

"Am I being too harsh with late deductions. I am TAing a senior level undergrad class for my major. I was grading labs where the assignment sheet said ""due by 5pm"" but the submission portal said 11:59pm. Basically, I had 3 sessions of students complete the lab on different dates and they each had 10 days to turn in the lab report. In Brightspace, I had 1 assignment tab for it so they all could submit to the same place, and it was open from the first lab session until the due date for the last group. I took a late deduction off for students that submitted after 5pm and explained that the assignment was late. I got a slew of emails today from students who are upset and saying things like ""I don't know why the due time matters when it takes you 2 weeks to grade the assignment anyway"". I get the frustration because I mistakenly put the wrong due time on Brightspace and I have a backlog of grading I'm working on, but I'm reluctant to give them the points. I think it would be unfair for 2/3 of the students who were in the earlier 2 lab sessions who submitted on time. No one mentioned the discrepancy in class or in an email until now. Also. they're supposed to be seniors and yet they can't handle the consequences of a late grade, which is a 10% deduction. Am I being unreasonable?

"Working with clinician-academics - is this normal. I’m at the end of my PhD. For the past year I’ve been working as a research assistant in a hospital-based research team (ie, with a clinician doing research in her clinical service). She’s a very experienced clinician and (despite being A/Prof) a very INexperienced academic. I have twelve years’ experience as a RA in universities, but I’m finding the hospital-based research setting completely different (and VERY challenging). I’m not sure if the following are normal - or if the problem is that the lead clinician (and the service broadly) is just far too inexperienced with academic research?: Huge lack of role clarity - random people (other RAs, junior doctors, clinicians, students, admin staff!) come into/out of projects on a whim leading to unclear authorship and lots of poor-quality/incomplete projects. I’ve been taken off projects I’ve contributed major IP to for some new/hot ‘researcher’ then put back on to clean up the mess left behind. That’s soul-crushing for me No direction in the research - just grabbing whatever semi-interesting project pops up, regardless of quality, data accuracy, or my workload. I’m a stickler for good, meaningful research (ie, not publishing for publication’s sake) and my supervisor treats this like a barrier Clinicians having me write 95% of their research protocols/papers/grants/conference abstracts, including original ideas/interpretation, and having me fully supervise their research students, etc. but taking first/senior author. I’m often second, third, or much lower behind others who have a clinical/professional interest (but virtually no intellectual input). My supervisor commented my role is to make the clinicians “look good” Australian public/government hospital for context. I’ve spent a year teaching proper research etiquette/protocol/methods and feel I’ve been heard/understood but progressively ignored. My line manager, the only other person from academia, has just resigned and moved on. So I’ve just been offered a temporary full-time RA role with this team.

Good afternoon everybody, I’m seeking advice and information regarding Chemistry education within the UK and the subsequent job opportunities available after completion. A couple of minutes or your time and advice could go a long way to helping me and I’d be extremely grateful. A bit of backstory, I’ve just completed my A-Levels in which I took Chemistry, Maths and Physics, with an expectation to achieve A’s and B’s with a small chance of an A\*. Throughout my time at college I wrested with the decision on what to do at university; Chemistry or Engineering. Ultimately, my final decision was to apply for a Masters in Chemistry at Manchester, as it is the subject I’m most passionate about but I also have a great love for all things science and engineering. However, since completing my exams and scouring the internet my problem has arose once more. My aspirations in life are to make a real positive influence in some way, whilst also having the opportunity to become wealthy and I was under the impression Chemistry allowed for that. To put it simply, whilst reading its become increasingly more apparent that Chemistry, although offering many career paths, doesn’t seem to be very expansive and offer much in terms of wealth in comparison to engineering. On top of this, I’m under the impression many affluent jobs related to Chemistry require PhD’s, which I question my capabilities to achieve. As well as this, I’ve also seen a heavy demand for coding and computer skills which I’m debating learning. However, my sources are inconclusive and I’m looking for more personal experience and opinions from people who have lived my scenario.

Almost half of what was on the curriculum was never covered. Mostly due to the instructor for the second half of the program was a bit mentally unstable and she just never taught us anything. We had no book work, exams, hands on work, projects, nothing. We occosaonlly covered a little here and there but almost the entire second half of it she just never taught to us. I did finish the program. I met with the school director and one of the partial owners of the school because I requested a 50% refund on my tuition. I explained all of it to them. I did receive grades in those modules that were missed, but those aren't real grades, because like I said, we never had any exams, projects, etc to be graded on. They were sympathetic and apologetic, and said I could sit in on classes to try to catch up what I missed. I said I wouldn't be able to do that because I won't be living in this area much longer, and also you can't piece together almost half a curriculum. Sit ins are for if you miss a day or two, not half of the entire program. They said they wouldnt refund the half of my tuition I requested, just offered the sit in option.

"I feel like a huge disappointment in my first semester. So I started a top 30 Ph.D. program in Chemistry in August and was ready to take it by storm. I excelled in a Master's program and had two weeks of intensive training before starting this program. There was every indication that I would excel here as well. It wasn't to be. Life threw shit tons of unexpected things my way, including extremely difficult things in my personal life. They sucked up huge amounts of my time and energy, which was very detrimental to my mental health and academic performance. And there were perfect storms and unfortunate things happening at the worst possible times. 1. Crippling fear about something in my personal life early on lasted for weeks and made me homesick. 2. An emotional crisis lasted an entire day shortly before Halloween, making me more homesick. 3. The worst emotional crisis of my life happened shortly before Thanksgiving. The crisis and its lingering effects were very disruptive to my studies going all the way to the week before finals. 4. I was intensely homesick and went through a depression during the last week of class. (Short, but at the worst time.) As a result, things snowballed out of control. I had to drop a class, get an incomplete, and I'm barely holding on in the remaining one. And I don't have an advisor yet. I'm not afraid that I'll be exposed as an imposter; I'm afraid that **I have been** exposed as an imposter. I'm very disappointed in how things went. I could have done better; there's plenty of room for improvement. And the crisis happened because of a simple mistake that could have been avoided. Is it my fault that the crisis happened and things fell apart? Is it my fault that things didn't go well and I performed so poorly? Do I deserve to be in this program? How do you deal with failure like this? What can help, other than therapy? (Which I am getting.) Am I too critical of myself?

"Let's analyze your request Roadmap: **The Goal - Step 1, The Mehtod - Step 2, The Strategies** **The Goal:** To study more effectively, and to motivate yourself to study. In order to do both of these, you'll need to make studying as simple and rewarding as possible, aka as pleasurable as possible. If it is so, you'll want to do it more and will do it better! **Step 1, The Method:** This is the overarching plan, aka *how* you'll accomplish the task: * Study based on the type of information presented * There are two types of information to me, ""memorizable"" and ""understood"" information * ""Understood"" information is the concepts and skills that you *get* and use to solve problems and draw concelusions * ""Memorizable"" information is the individual facts that allow you to accurately understand and apply the concepts * Studying them wrong is difficult and a waste of time, so let me show you the right way * ""Understood"" information, which you can find by looking for key concepts and the words ""why"" and ""how"", should be understood by expressing it in your own words * It goes like this: make sure you are focused, read the concept, look away, and then write it in your own words. Check with the original information to fix any holes in your understanding * The ""own words"" part forces your brain to understand and *get* the concept in order to reformat it. The focus helps with retention * ""Memorized"" information -- aka individual facts, important numbers/constants, dates, names, or places, vocabulary, formulas, and information presented in lists (like ""5 characteristic of an XYZ"") -- should be memorized. Don't worry, there isn't much of this; textbooks spend most of their time explaining concepts rather than listing facts * Memorization help is available in Step 2 of this comment * Review often * The next way to make studies more rewarding and simple is by reducing the headache known as ""forgetting what you studied"" * In that case, make sure to review the information you studied at these three intervals until the test. * After each chapter/topic. As soon as you study a chapter, review it. Forgetting begins immeditaley * 1-2 days after studying something, this is when you're also likely to forget. Revire all of the chapters/topics that you studied that day * Every week after that. This helps the information to not get pushed out of your mind as you learn new things * Note: ""Review"" means reciting the information (facts and concepts) and attempting a couple of practice problems involving all of the information (usually at the end of the chapter, or you can ask an AI for practice problems involving the specific chapter or topic) * If you have time, make sure to check with the original information or your notes to fix any holes in your memory. If some memorizable information fades away, try your best to fix it. If the test is mostly conceptual, it shouldn't matter that much * Clean up your notes and study area * Organizing something perfectly accomplishes the goal of making something simple and easy to use * Since you will spend most of your time studying notes in your study area, organizing them will make your studies much easier, and therefore more effective as well as more attractive to do again * Make your studies rewarding by checking off mini-goals * The final way to make your studies rewarding is to organize them into a daily plan and to check off items that you complete. this gives you a great feeling known as ""productivity"" * Also, you can take a picture of your progress on the daily plan after every day. Whenever you feel worthless or unmotivated, you can look at how you've been working day in and day out toward your goals. That should motivate you to get up and continue! * Also, nobody wants to keep pictures of barely attempted plans on their phone, so it's motivating for that reason as well. ;-) * Making your daily plans realistic will mean that you'll often get everything on it done, and completing everything on your plan is an extra productive feeling **Step 2, The Strategies**: These are the individual tactics you'll use to carry out the method, aka *what* you will do * The most important strategies for this method are focus, memorization, properly organized note taking, general organization (for your study area), and time management (to put together a realistic-yet-effective daily plan) * However, I know that I am not qualified to set in stone what the best study strategies are, but the *community of fellow students,* lots of whom are in similar situations, **are** * Therefore, I suggest referencing the [search page found in this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zk7xUZogIZSvDL0SE74qbEPtn-fYT7h_WNaEE5BP33g/edit?usp=sharing) * In under a minute, its top search result compiles what the majority of students decide as the most helpful study tips for any given topic, and its other results allow you to discover new tips from the community * Remember that this is not a one-use tool. The engine supports over 20 study skills (memorization, time management, math, etc), and you can search it whenever you have a problem studying. * Therefore, you can learn the most helpful tips, apply them, beat the issue, and get back to work * So go find those focus, memorization, note taking, organization and time management tips, your studies won't complete themselves! :) Thanks for reading my answer, I wish you nothing but the best, Your friend, Dasani",Examination,Medium,1.0,web:pullpush:r/students:comment:issue,Medium,1,5442,924,5,"Let's analyze your request Roadmap: **The Goal - Step 1, The Mehtod - Step 2, The Strategies** **The Goal:** To study more effectively, and to motivate yourself to study.",0
"Senior year AP exam scores come out long after admissions decisions are made, so that's why schools don't require them in applications. MIT doesn't require them for the admissions process. If you're enrolled you are expected to report them but it's not going to help or harm your application at that point: ""Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, and other standardized exams Students should self-report scores for standardized exams they have taken or plan to take, such as Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, A-level, Baccalauréat, etc., on the Test scores section of the application. **We do not require applicants to officially send scores as part of their application**, and instead have a verification process upon enrollment.""

"Is this Level of Disorganization Normal. I supposed to begin a one-year Masters of Arts in Teaching program in July. But I have gotten, what looks to me, like red flags. Before I entered the program, I was told that there would not be any online courses, but now one of my courses will be online. This is not because of any COVID related concerns, but it is because they didn't rework the schedule from last year. They also didn't tell me about a teacher training session happening this week until May 17th, after I had worked out my housing accommodations, so I am unable to attend it. When I asked about this, I was told they would provide me with an online participation option, but today I have been told this isn't happening and "".we will pass along any important information."" I don't want to be whiny, I know these are small concerns, but a large portion of my correspondences thus far have had issues. (Before I was accepted, I received frustrating contradictory messages about how to apply for a certain scholarship. My acceptance letter included the line "".your faculty advisor is. "" (I did NOT censor a name in that quote, although the advisor did send me an email introduction shortly thereafter.)) I know this is all small stuff, but I am concerned these are indicative of larger issues with the school. I have already payed a deposit on the program and housing and it is probably too late to pull out. Any greater perspective would be appreciated.

"My B+ in Physics 2 is still just considered a ""B"" or 3.0 on transcript. I did not realize that this community college doesn't give +/- for letter grades and I think that is unfair! I obtained an 88%, so a B+ or 3.3 GPA should have been granted but instead I was simply given a B and a 3.0 GPA. I am worried this will impact my GPA for vet school application now, I mean maybe only slightly but still. It is frustrating that it seems I did worse in the class now than I actually did!

"I'm the secretary, but I'm doing all the president's work — should I ask for co-presidency. Hi! I’m currently involved in a college association, and at the beginning, the teacher supervising us suggested I take on the role of secretary. At the time, I thought, “Sure, why not.” He explained that the person he had in mind for president — a very outgoing, talkative girl — had the right profile to represent the association publicly, which made sense on paper. But now, two weeks in, I’m starting to feel that the situation is unfair. I’m the one coordinating tasks between members, organizing meetings, making sure things actually run — while she’s mostly been present for the “fun” parts, like parties. I’ve taken a lot of initiative, and I feel like I’m basically doing what a president is expected to do, without the recognition that comes with the title. The official vote for the office roles is in two weeks. Do you think it would be appropriate to talk to the supervising teacher and suggest a co-presidency instead? That way, she could still be the face of the association, while I’d continue handling the organizational side — but with a role that actually reflects my contribution. The teacher did say that these roles are mostly symbolic — but let’s be real: when external people see “secretary” next to my name, they’ll assume I’m just doing the admin, not leading or coordinating. And that doesn’t sit right with me",Faculty,Low,0.0,web:pullpush:r/college:submission:unfair,Low,0,1428,247,6,"I'm the secretary, but I'm doing all the president's work — should I ask for co-presidency.",0

"Should I walk at graduation. Sorry, this ends up being a bit of a ramble, but I need somewhere to get this out and needed advice: I've been struggling with this for a while and need some unbiased povs, so if you could pls help me, I'd appreciate it. I started college at my dream school, but due to politicians trying to make a name for themselves, I found out in May of 2023 that I would need to transfer bc most/basically all of the classes I needed to graduate would no longer be offered, and the future of the school was unclear. So last minute, I transferred to a school that, while it had my major, it was nowhere near as good, but I could afford it without going into debt, and they were still accepting students. I am now graduating at the end of the fall semester and am struggling with the question of: Should I walk? All of my family is saying yes, I should, and before I was indifferent/leaning towards maybe, but I'm not sure if emotionally I can handle it. I graduated high school in 2020, so my high school graduation was already shit and has kind of made me not care for graduation ceremonies in general, but my big problem is I can't even think about walking at graduation without bursting into tears. Within 6 months, I lost the two grandparents I was the closest to, and I had always imagined them being at my graduation, even if it was just over video call. And even when I graduate, it will be approaching the 1-year anniversary of losing my grandma (dad's mom) and the 6-month mark of losing my grandpa (mom's dad, who has also paid for my entire degree)",Other,Medium,1.0,web:reddit:r/college:new,Medium,1,1576,296,16,Should I walk at graduation.,0

I was extremely lazy this past year and also wasn't able to focus well in school for about 2 months due to health issues.

"I don't know how to handle a student with ""brain damage."" Suggestions. So. I'm teaching an introduction class for non-majors and I have a student who has a ""severe brain damage"" report. In class, he constantly raised his hand to ask irrelevant questions and object to objectively visible/valid things (imagine something like ""social media is commonly used today""). Although exhausting, I was able to manage those. But in two cases, I really didn't know what to do and have no idea what I would do if they happen again. First one is, after again objecting to something really insignificant and objectively valid, he told me that I was wrong and that I should go do some research about it. In my native language, we have a polite/formal and an informal ""you."" Students almost exclusively use the formal one when talking to their professors. I also refer to my students with the formal one (although this is not common practice). Now, normally, I don't care if students use informal you, but in this instance it was VERY rude and made it very awkward for everyone. I ignored that remark and kept lecturing. He kept mumbling for a couple of seconds, but eventually stopped. The second one was rather scary. He said he disagreed on something else and when I gave him some examples, he got. agitated? He said a couple of things and then started to play with his hair and ultimately started pulling it out. This went on for a minute or two and he eventually stopped. But I honestly don't know what to do about it. I'm also mad at the school for putting me into a situation I'm not equipped to deal with. I only got a report that says ""he should be allowed to use computers in exams."" Has anyone had a similar experience?
