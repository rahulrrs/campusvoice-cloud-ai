"If you are a first-year looking to decide between CS and SE, please read this post. There are many bland courses that SE students have to take to get an engineering degree, but SE463 is the crown jewel in terms of useless information. (Disclaimer: I was lucky enough to take this course with Jo Atlee, who is one of the better SE professors; however, even not Mother Teresa could make a miracle out of this one.) Basing this course off of our FYDP project did the exact opposite of making students understand their FYDP better; it only made time to actually work and improve our project scarce, with its numerous weekly assignments. I will not remember a thing about this course in a week from the writing of this review, but most of my peers would agree that this was probably the most stressful course to study for. There were ABSOLUTELY no previous finals that we could practice with (all potential ones were outdated, ranging from 16~20 years old. No, I'm serious.), there were no midterm for us to check our understanding of the course with halfway through, and students have to pass the final to pass the course, to top it off. For context, there were more than 500 slides of content that needed to be sifted through for information we would use once in the exam and never again. The phrase ""flying in the dark"" was made for this course. This is a plea to the Software Engineering Directors: Please. Reconsider the content of this course, for the sake of future prospective SE students. For the first year reading this and trying to make a decision:Take into account your appetite for learning information you will never need. For current SE students who have yet to take this course: If you're reading this its too late. I'm so sorry.",Exam,2,Medium,1,Examination Dept,2_Uwaterloo

The course notes and Janelle's Lectures were my primary way of learning. Janelle is GOAT. Conrad ruined it for most students. I think this course had potential for being fun, but disorganization by course leads, bs piazza rules, and overall shitty experience made me hate this course. We can't even express our thoughts on piazza without getting banned. And the team only marked half our 1% assignments without telling us which ones at one points which started a fuss on piazza at one point.

The rubric and marking scheme is rather unfair in my opinion - a high A is only achievable with ""award-worthy, industry-ready work"", which is a) unfeasible for a 101 course and b) especially unfeasible given the amount of teaching done and the spreading of the deadlines, in which they basically fling projects at you until you somehow are expected to become an Adobe Suite master.

"In the beginning of the term this course felt very useless. However, that was the most childish a wanna be theoretical physicist can tell himself. A lot of what you will learn in this course will be useful as it will be the foundation of the mathematics you will need to solve a lot of theoretical physics problems. A lot of what u learn in this course is also useful in proving equations u derive as a physicist. You will learn things like Complex numbers, Methods of Proof, The Binomial Theory, Summations and repeated multiplications. All of these concepts are useful for example when we try to approximate equations in Physics, a good understanding of Summations is required. Binomial theory may be used to expand Relativistic kinetic energy equation. Lets say u as a mathematical physicist derived an equation some how. Now u want to make sure that the equation is valid, a basic knowledge of what u learn in this course may be helpful. Complex numbers can be spotted in Schrodinger's Wave Equation. If u are serious about physics, don't take this course lightly. Although this might be an over exaggeration but I feel like this course is as important as Calculus. So In calculus you will be asked to derive Taylor polynomials, how will you do that without a basic understanding of Summations? Although the science mathematical physics students donot have to take this course before taking math 136 (linear algebra for honours math), this course is very useful in math 136. The proof techniques you learn in this course like Proof by Strong induction may be useful in Linear algebra. And all physics enthusiasts know the importance of linear algebra in physics. One can finish most of math 137 (calculus) assignments without having to look at lectures (I donot recommend this) and get a good grade. You cannot even solve the first question in math 135 before fully understanding all concepts in the lectures. I personally very much disliked this course mostly because the math learned was very new compared to what I was taught in school and it was difficult to understand these ideas. But I did enjoy learning about the new concepts. but I understand that the content taught is very important. Therefore, if u are an apprising physicist, take the course seriously. If u like pure math take this course seriously, if u like CS take this course seriously. If u like Finance take this course seriously. If u like painting take this course seriously (u need to understand the golden ratio to figure out how to make ur art perfect). Regardless of ur major, please don't undermine the value this course provides. This course sucks no doubt, but it is hella useful so pay attention in class and do all assignments even though u can drop one. A criticism I would have with this course is the lack of applications. Although this course content has many applications the course is designed in a way that suggests that there is none except in pure math. I would like that to change. And if possible please make a physics based Math135 and math 136 please and thankyou.",Exam,2,High,0,Examination Department,2_Uwaterloo_course_reviews_with_sampling_criteria.csv

"CHEM 237 took it w/ Dara in winter 2019. she’s very disorganized and the course is terribly arranged in terms of concepts. she also once did two quizzes in tutorial; she did the first one, waited for people to leave then did the second one. if you didn’t come, you missed 2 quizzes that day; that’s the kind of monster you’re dealing with. to succeed, you have to listen to her lectures twice. you’ll probably leave the class not knowing wtf happened but then watch her lecture video and it’ll make more sense. to counter how disorganized she is, before the start of a new unit, look up AK Lectures on youtube and watch the playlist of said topic. for example, before the enzyme unit, look up “enzyme playlist AK lectures” and watch it at 1.5 speed (he talks slow). you don’t need notes or anything, just listen and try to get the general idea. that way, you know the heirarchy and structure of topics; that way her disorganization. attend tutorials as some test questions come from there. try to make/join your class facebook groupchat for assignment help cause some of the assignments are tough to get thru but you def can get a 100 in all of them w group effort and hard work. it’s not that hard of a course tbh, too bad it’s just very very disorganized imo. oh and know your acid base chem.",Exam,2,Medium,1,Examination Department,2_Uwaterloo_course_reviews_with_sampling_criteria.csv

"They say this is a continuation to AFM373, but this course is way easier. I think when Blake and Ecclestone taught this before, it was actually hard, but with Alan Huang and JAD, it's not that bad. The only problem is, it's too easy and the things you learn are too useless. 373 focused a lot on valuations, DCF, synergies and financial modelling. This course was purely theoretical and bsing. Our final exam on derivatives, had no derivatives in it and was rather a strategies case like AFM433. While in equities from Alan Huang we learned some interesting theories, they are not that practical in real life. Ecclestone would let students do stock simulations and so on, this course has none of those practical applications. It almost feels like they try too hard not to teach students finance (knowing this is for CPA students), it seems like we didn't learn much in this course. Presentations take up way too much time. Students are just not paying attention whenever people are presenting, there's nothing to do. Yet we should have spent that time wasted on actually learning finance. Peer critiquing was a big problem too. People just snake each other no matter how well you do. This course is very disorganized and you honestly don't learn any finance. If you are actually interested, take 424 + 322. This course is rushed in a way that you don't even get to go too deep on any topic. Derivatives was especially plain. All the hedging stuff you learned from AFM121. Grading was also very subjective. When you are at 4B, the people who mark your finance cases are ""industry professionals"". But they are very unprofessional when they mark stuff, taking marks off for things such as no page numbers, formatting, or font size. Marks wise it is ok. Everyone got around high 70s to 80s. The profs are nice too. It's just that the course itself is not very useful. They honestly should just make AFM students mandatory taking afm424 and 322.

Some of the things that we focused on in 362 will be less important here such as stock options benefit, auto benefit, what to include/exclude for employment income...and so on. After the midterm, however, many new concepts were introduced and it was so crammed with so many new things that the course was quite hard to catch up on. Something like AOC, Associated Corps, SRED, income vs. capital, could really be difficult to understand. For these new concepts, there were only like 1 practice question per concept (and the question is hard), so it's really hard to study for them. You really need to do your questions. The second part of the course was focused on concepts and our final had like no calculation (calculators weren't needed near the end). It was very strange. Midterm was a lot of calculation though. For your final, you need to memorize everything and take good notes on what he says in class. You really have to go to class. Finally, Rogo snaked us in the end. We all dropped like 10%. Maybe the average was too high (76% for midterm), or the assignments average was too high, he marked our final exams really hard. The final was really easy but the average was probably around 60%.

These will make you fall asleep because they are more dull than your grandfather telling you the same newspaper article for the 8th time. You will see approximately 40 equations that sometimes match with the content they've been plopped into. The most useless ones are the most useful. 2. Light frosting of lectures that tip-toe over the top of the pit that is the textbook work. Will possibly have an example that doesn't relate to the assigned questions, and won't actually show how to approach it. Just a question, then a final answer. No steps in-between. 3. Assigned questions from the textbook. These sometimes give you values, and then other ones you have to assume. The assumptions will lose you marks, but the questions cannot be solved without them. You'll look at these questions and not understand them, so you'll try going through the textbook chapters only to find they don't help at all. So you answer roughly half the questions with a half-baked equation mess, learning absolutely nothing. 4. You get your assignment back with a grade of 45%, so you check the assignment solutions, only to see some of your answers are surprisingly the exact same as the solution set posted yet you only got 0.5/2 with no indication what you did right or wrong. They also have nothing to do with the chapter you read. 5. Rinse and repeat until enough students complain and get told it's their fault they don't understand the content and don't know how to approach problems they weren't taught how to approach.

"For me, pretty much everything in this course was new which made it one of the more challenging ones. The first thing to do is get a basic understanding of matrices if you've never used them. A lot of the other students had learned them in high school so it was harder for me to catch up. (Check out khanacademy.org for tutorials). Also imaginary numbers. Don't be confused by them, as long as you don't think about it too much they're very easy to work with. Another big part of the course is properties of conic functions (these are circles, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas), there will be a whole bunch of properties you've never heard of thrown at you here, all I can say is MEMORIZE and you'll be fine (and it's actually pretty cool). If I recall correctly there's a little section on converting numbers between decimal and binary number systems. This was insanely easy for me, simply because I knew my POWERS of TWO. Memorize them up to at least 2^10 and this will be a breeze. (Also knowing powers of two comes in handy for MANY applications down the road). The last thing comes back to matrices. You will hear the words Gaussian Elimination and Gauss-Jordan Elimination, and Row Echelon Form, and Reduced Row Echelon Form thrown around all over the place. Also ""forward elimination. backward substitution"". Learn explicitly what these things actually mean and what the differences are, so you can forget about all the silly words and just Do It.

IL-1, IL-3, IL-6, CXCL7, CTLA-4, CD45, CD40L etc) with little effort in class to tie everything together. Midterm averages were in the 60 range, unsurprisingly. Lab section did not follow lecture material. Class was asked to give a presentation on an assigned topic for no marks at the end of the term. Overall, course material itself was very interesting, and I'm glad I took it just to brush up on my immuno.

The teacher has a very narrow perception and if you don’t agree with her viewpoint are considered “wrong” in her eyes. You are forced to do a large number of “quick-writes” or else fail the course, and when they say “quick” they really mean it.

"If you think AFM433 is bs, then you DO NOT take this course! This is by far the most bs course I've ever taken in SAF, especially with Zamal teaching it. ACC685 is CPA elective and is supposed to be a much enhanced version of ACC680, yet Zamal only focuses on the strategy part and nothing on cost or quants and the course is entirely full of bs. A simple strategy case that could have been taught in 1 lecture is split into 3 full classes, you literally learn nothing. The cases are outdated, long, and made no sense (because it was not written for CPA purposes, but for MBA Harvard/Ivey) Zamal is actually very lazy and he makes no effort in updating course material and claims that nothing has changed over the past 20 years and therefore we use the slides from 20 years ago. Also, he tries to bs his way out whenever he doesn't know the answers, which occurs often. Many of us took this course because we heard it was ""bird"". This is not the case this year. What happened is that Zamal was too lazy and he didn't change the midterm/final from the previous year, so the entire class from the year before got 90s. For our year, he totally screwed us over by making 2 hard cases for midterm and gave us all low marks for participation, assignment, and exams. By the way, he makes ""C"" only a 90%, so even if you get a ""C"" on your case, which is under CPA standards - perfect score, you won't get a 100% on your case. He's effectively capping your performance at 90% (max you'll get), and he makes RC a 70% when it's supposed to be a 75%. This course DOES NOT help you prepare your CFE. If you think you're going to take PM role, then just spend more effort on 680 with Nancy and Janet because you learn more from them. There are not many PM role cases available since CFE started in 2015, but he makes no effort to make it better. He could have asked Nancy and used some of her cases or modified them, or just use CPA cases, but no, he just continued using the previous prof's cases because he's that lazy. He also never replies his email, and never holds office hours (since he commutes). Good luck trying to reach him for help because he's not willing to.

"Very difficult course with Martin Pei. Along with a straightforward lecture review, we had three weekly, difficult, rigorous proof questions. Despite starting as early as possible for majority of these questions, I would be working on them for most of the day, every day up until the due date and still not be able to fully finish one or two. While Martin Pei's lectures were superb (as usual), they almost never provide any direction whatsoever for any of the proof questions. Rather, they state a basic definition or a key theorem we need to use *somewhere* in the proof. Many of the proof questions require a lot of creative thinking, to the point where reading the posted solutions is mind-blowing (mostly in a negative way). The proofs had a seemingly rigid, unique grading scheme which was supposed to assign a grade based on the quality of your proof, rather than specific marks for whether you included something from the model solution. On paper, this sounded really nice, yet in practice, I would get wildly different results. Complete proofs which were correct except for maybe one major logical flaw near the end would receive 30% (which is explicitly stated to be for partial solutions). Meanwhile, actual partial solutions which were outright missing key information would receive, in some cases, 80% (which is stated to be what their posted model solutions get...?). Moreover, the feedback for the proofs would be very lackluster. If your solution deviates from the posted solution, don't expect to get an explanation as to what you did incorrectly. That being said, take this course if you want to improve your proof-writing skills in strides, but be prepared for some of the hardest proof questions you have likely encountered up until this point, and also expect your interest in Graph Theory to fizzle out by the end.",Exam,2,High,0,Examination Department,2_Uwaterloo_course_reviews_with_sampling_criteria.csv

"This course is a big fat waste of time, effort, energy, blood, sweat, and tears. It's too much for a student who doesn't plan on pursuing a tax-based career, and a lot of what you learn will be heavily automated anyways. So there really is no point in it. It should have been a Master's elective. Whoever designed this course is ridiculous - basically the profs spend 95% of lecture time taking up problems that could have easily been self-taught if you had access to the solutions. But wait! The profs don't post the solutions because ""they'll get in trouble"" - which is even more ironic considering that one of the profs WROTE the book! Another glaring flaw is the participation weighting. Essentially you have to properly participate in class 4-5 times to earn the full mark, which is pretty much impossible because the class acts like a hunger games arena anyways. Oh, and the people who take down your participation are the students themselves, so that's also another control deficiency! Profs themselves literally cannot pick all the students 5 times each lecture too, and they tend to pick the same people to answer the questions anyways.

There are many reactions that you learn in this course and it’s much better if you actually understand the mechanism of each reaction rather than just memorizing the products it produces since it’s very likely you will lose marks by picking the wrong answer on the multiple choice midterms and exam.

"This course is pretty hard and I originally took it as one of the requirements for my minor. Bad choice. I am not an anthro major and this was an extremely small class with only around 15 people and most of them are in the anthro department. Aside from this, Prof Liu is a good teacher but a hard marker. In terms of assignments, the weightings and subjectivity are quite unfair that it's really difficult to earn a good mark in this course. Participation accounted for 20% of your mark, and despite that I never missed a class, and participate in discussions, I did not get a good mark. I am baffled by the subjectivity of this course and how the assignments are marked. I usually don't understand why I lose marks and overall it accumulates to my overall bad mark. I am disappointed. In terms of course content, it is quite similar to sociology but the readings are lengthy written by anthropologists that are difficult to read and at the same time hard to write. If you would like to explore social issues and the themes written in the description, I suggest you take SOC or something else. Finally, the prof is nice and a good presenter which makes the small class bearable, but that doesn't matter if your mark is bad. They removed the pre-reqs for this course and I expect this class to get larger and different profs will be teaching it, so your experience may be different.

"I was looking forward to this course but it turned out to be very disappointing, mainly due to the professor who taught it. Firstly, no course schedule was given despite several students asking for one. We had 5 assignments (1 essay, 4 assignments using R, and a final ERA along with a group presentation). Since no assignment schedule was given, it was hard to plan assignments around other courses and assignments were given very sporadically. Secondly, he does not give enough time to complete assignments. He assigned the final ERA (worth 30 %) with no warning during the last few weeks of November, which is the busiest time of the school year. Almost the whole class had to half-ass the ERA due to lack of time. After we handed in our ERAs, he assigned us groups and only gave us 5 days to prepare a 10-15 minute presentation worth 15% of our mark, also in the busiest last weeks of the semester. This caused stress among all group members due the tight timeline. Lastly, there was a final exam but no midterm. This left the class having no idea what to expect for the final exam. I ended up getting a pretty low mark in this class due to the tight timelines. Since I wasn't able to plan assignments for this class, it also lowered my mark in other classes.",Exam,2,Medium,1,Examination Dept,2_Uwaterloo

The professors excuse was that the TAs are getting paid for this and their only ""working hours"" are the 3 hour check in sessions that happen biweekly. So at my lab 4 check in, I tried to ask my TA questions about uncertainty calculations, formula substitution, etc, and he kept interrupting me telling me he didn't have time to answer questions.

I personally found the midterm to be quite easy because I had a solid grasp of high school concepts and had a very good teacher in grade twelve, but the majority of people had a lot of trouble (the average was around a 55% in 2015). The final was more difficult, because the questions were of the same difficulty as the midterm, but were considerably longer and because we had far less exposure to the possible problem types for concepts like torque, rolling motion, static equilibrium, angular momentum, etc. If you want to excel in this course, you MUST do every practice problem that is assigned, and you should DEFINITELY do numerous practice midterms and finals to prepare for the exam (I did three for each and found myself trying to learn new problem types on the exams--do between five to ten to be maximally prepared).

"Her lectures were unengaging and ran overtime frequently. She would randomly give extra credits on the assignment in the lectures even though they were all really obscure and basically guessing (I say this having gotten some). She continuously accused students of stopping her Teams recording multiple times even though it was her fault. The twice weekly quizzes had typos frequently, to get them right you had to guess whether or not it was an implication or typo. Textbook was useless, to understand I used another prof's course notes. We were forced to use Perusall, for which we were marked for ""productiveness"" of our conversations. Also the system tracking reading time underreported. The textbook was terrible, had too many typos (Linear Alg with Applications by Holt) had frequent wrong proofs. We were never actually taught how to do proofs despite class being supposedly an introduction. What would be one theorem in another class is 3+ in this textbook. This is very annoying when every assignment has you cite the EXACT theorem or definition number over and over, which wasted so much time. We had to do 3-4 textbook chapters/week no matter what, even if certain fundamental concepts that in other classes would be given an extra week were just zoomed through. Assignments had way too many questions, and hugely variable in time taken. Like 30+ random textbook questions every week. No joke, I spent 10 hours straight on an assignment and still didn't finish it. Most questions required ridiculous numbers of computations where each individual step had to be written down. The midterm had two typos, one was minor and the other fundamentally changed a question. She did not update the crowdmark with the fixed version, but sent out an email just slightly before the midterm saying the mistakes. Other than that was a fair exam. The final was impossible, it seemed like random questions out of the textbook with no regard to total time taken, where fundamental understanding was barely tested. I doubt the professor even made a key. By the end of the course there were 18 students left, 9 failed the exam. We also had to make our own theorem sheet, and with the amount of separate definitions/theorems it was so much stress. Tutorials were useless, TA knew nothing.

"Genuinely the worst academic experience I've had in my entire life. The lecture slides themselves were often difficult to understand, and Pin-Han Ho's lecture videos consisted of him reading from them verbatim in a thick and sometimes incomprehensible accent. Even though our profs implemented weekly quizzes after the midterm to ease some of the weight off of the final exam, (1) the diagrams were low-res and difficult to read, (2) on one occasion the quiz was unreasonably long, and many people didn't finish it in the provided time, and (3) the marking process was a bit disorganized, with the feedback being vague or even nonexistent. The final was the cherry on top of the disaster heap of ECE 124: a behemoth of an exam which averaged a 10+ hour completion time, and at least 3 different marking schemes which the professors are still changing a week after we wrote the final. Don't get me wrong: the material this course covers is fairly interesting, and with a good professor I think it could be enjoyable. Pre-midterm material (minterms, maxterms, SOP/POS, K-maps, some circuit design) is pretty straightforward. Post-midterm material, which features the analysis and synthesis of asynchronous and synchronous sequential circuits, is a bit trickier, but just figure out how to apply the different algorithms and you should be fine. But if you end up with Professor Pin-Han Ho, buckle in and make sure you've got the textbook handy: you're in for a bumpy, potentially psychologically-scarring ride.",Exam,2,High,0,Examination Department,2_Uwaterloo_course_reviews_with_sampling_criteria.csv

"One of the worst courses I've ever taken. Peter Bhur is an incredible lecturer, but his concurrency methods are irrelevant. Most of what you will learn in this course is not used in practice, usually because they are too complicated/incomprehensible, but sometimes because it's just not how people implemented it. There's a lot of cool little facts you'll learn in the course, but most of them are just little tidbits of knowledge that you talk about with people to impress them (did you know C can handle most exceptions?), and aren't useful. I honestly don't believe I've learned anything RELEVANT about concurrency that I didn't know already. The assignments in this course were the worst assignments I've ever had. About 70-80% of the time spent working on them was spent building time wasting things like output generators or trying to parse what the assignment was even asking. None of the assignment questions were hard, they were just time consuming, in the worst way. There was also no opportunity for creativity in problem solving; you were told exactly what to do, and exactly how to do it (usually in very confusing language), and any deviation would lose you marks. The marking on the assignments was insane. You will have marks taken off for things that aren't WRONG, but Buhr didn't do it that way, so you lose marks. You will lose marks for putting code in one perfectly reasonable place when Buhr put it somewhere else. You will lose marks for formatting your code differently that Buhr formats his code. I submitted an answer for a theoretical question once, in which you can come up with two different answers depending on how your interpret the problem, and submitted a full proof, and I got 30% on the question because Buhr got the other answer. They didn't say or explain why they thought my proof was wrong; I was simply wrong because Buhr did it another way. We also need to talk about micro C++. This is Buhr's language that he designed for concurrency, but nobody uses, except for this course. You'll quickly learn there are very good reasons nobody uses the language. The syntax is pretty bad, and there is essentially no documentation or help out there except for the documentation Buhr has. The language also has it's share of errors and bugs, which Buhr will most likely find throughout the term. I have counted 11 errors in the language that were solved by just remaking. In the end, I feel sad about this course. Concurrency is a very interesting topic, and Buhr is honestly the best lecturer I've ever had. If he took that passion and applied it to teaching useful things, and let someone else make and mark the assignments, I could have really loved this course. But as it stands, I would strongly suggest you don't take this course unless you absolutely have to. You'll learn more about concurrency from trying to build an Android app or making a toy concurrent system that you'll ever learn from this course.",Exam,2,High,0,Examination Department,2_Uwaterloo_course_reviews_with_sampling_criteria.csv

"If you are looking for a really easy bird course, beware! This course requires a lot of effort. Although her notes that she gives you are very clear, there is a ton of information (like any biology course). The assignments - 3 quizzes and assignments (30% of grade) and one final assignment (15% of grade) are time consuming (she expects you to be thorough and detailed... yet concise and to the point). They do help you grasp the concepts taught in lecture though. If you put effort into them, can easily achieve 90's+. The quizzes are timed for an hour each with anywhere between 15-30 questions multiple choice - these were easy and you can refer to your notes if need be. The exam was UNFAIR. 15 questions in 2.5 hours did not give anyone enough time to present the level of details she expected. The exam was different from what she said it would be (e.g., she said it would be short answers & labelling diagrams like the assignments, but it had identifying graphs, providing the definition for words and explaining figures as well). After around lecture 15/25 the course content gets heavier, so be sure to stay on top of the work load. The lectures are all audio no video and they are ~45 minutes each (2 per week, for 12 weeks). So overall if you're willing to put in work still and commit over the to learning you will be fine.

"This class had AMAZING content, lectures, and topics but unfortunately, it has to have been the most disorganized and frustrating class in my whole entire University career so far as a second-year student. To give this course a fair and honest review I will go into it with plenty of depth. Topic-wise I was hooked. I enjoyed learning about protests, criminal law actors, gender, children and youth justice etc, and honestly the lectures were quite relaxed and VERY helpful for the midterm and exams. No lecture slides (which many students disliked)... but I actually found this helpful because the weekly agenda in this course is attending the (1) lecture and (2) break out group... then (3) take notes and you will ace the exams. The breakdown of assignments were okay but I found the marking to be ALL over the place and incohesive.

"An incredible amount of this course is so vastly beyond the scope of a first year's level. With the exception of a few units, like those of gravitation, special relativity, photons and the part of the nuclear physics module that actually bothered with nuclear physics, the subject matter appeared to me as if I had missed several years worth of physics and math pre-requisites. The first tutorial was interestingly called a ""math review"" while introducing us to a great deal of new material revolving around complex numbers in a panic inducing rush. The tests were rather comical in how much they needed to be curved in order to get a somewhat reasonable average out of a total lack of understanding of the class for pretty much half the material, even with the generous grading. The entire unit of general relativity was so outlandishly beyond us, to the point it was wholly an exercise in futility, something professor Mann seemed to recognize, and assured us would not be tested on. And yet, a long and difficult graded assignment was still issued on it. I can understand showing us a general intro to GR's concepts, but actually going into its mathematics is ridiculous. What I did learn in this course was incredible and wonderful, and made it all the more unfortunate that such could not be done justice because this course tries to condense all of the frontiers of physics into a single course for first years. I understand and appreciate the idea is to introduce advanced concepts in order to get us acquainted and thinking about these ideas early so that we will be more receptive to them later on, but ultimately I doubt I will retain much if any of the concepts too advanced to be learned properly at this level. I would prefer to just learn such concepts at the appropriate level with the requisite background when the time comes, rather than cramming it in here where it is a huge stress for little if any gain, while simultaneously cutting short the other concepts introduced that are appropriate for first years.",Exam,2,Medium,1,Examination Department,2_Uwaterloo_course_reviews_with_sampling_criteria.csv

"I took this course with Tan Dinh and found it very poorly organised and dysfunctional. You can take my review with a grain of salt because math and physics are subjects I am awful at, however, some important points. Every review you see here about how your TA makes or breaks the course and it wasn not a great time is correct. If your TA doesn't care and you've never done physics in high school, this course will be extremely hard and require a lot of studying in your free time, especially if physics isn't something that comes naturally. We were told by Tan to not ask questions and my TA would often ask my question back to me, tell me they weren't allowed to answer my question, or say something like ""well would do you think"" which isn't very helpful if you genuinely don't know what you're doing. I also found Tan very condescending? During the first lab, I was struggling with the ""improvements for the lab"" section and when I asked for feedback he essentially told me it was terrible, he's seen kids do better, and offered little feedback or suggestions. He also did not show up to the many subsequent labs so you're completely reliant on your TA (and I feel like I didn't have a great one) tldr: how much your TA likes teaching determines how much fun you'll have in this course, if you aren't good at physics please avoid at all costs.

This resulted in 7 weeks of rushed lab reports (1 per week), when the 3 weeks from the beginning of the semester could have allowed for students to complete formal lab reports with some more time (especially considering they were worth 10 and 20%, respectively). Furthermore, there was inconsistency between the information each of the TAs were giving out. I found that my peers got more useful information than I did; things that my TA said she couldn't help me with were covered by other TAs.

I would strongly recommend to anyone taking this course to have a strong background in algorithms and data structures, multivariable control systems, multivariate statistics, non-linear optimization, and graph theory. I completed a math minor and I could barely understand any of the math in this course. None of these things are taught properly throughout the course (And most of these topics are definitely not in any undergraduate engineering program) but you'll be expected to know them.

"I saw a review for another material science course (ME 115) that really embodied this course as well. So, I will use some of it here and just add a few points here there, so you know what makes this course really STAND OUT. THIS IS THEEEEE WORST COURSE I have ever taken and the most hated class in 2A for my cohort. The lectures were sooo……….boring and useless, which motivated most of the class to never show up. The textbook is completely useless as well, just pages and pages of conceptual ideas, and then just a bunch of numerical calculations you have no idea how to do. Often, they require you to make wild assumptions or just happen to memorize certain values about a property you would normally look for in a chart. The book barely and I mean barely skims the topic and then it tells you to google the rest for yourself. The tutorials are literally questions from the textbook, which usually does not relate to what it spoke about. The labs were poorly designed; students are sometimes required to buy or search for household items to carry out the experiment. The lab manual always presents a cheap, flimsy experimental setup in the form of a picture with very little organized and comprehensible instruction on how to actually set it up and carry out the procedure, which just of course led to way too many experimental errors, and thus the least accurate data possible. Many large concepts that were repeatedly mentioned throughout the course didn't show up once on the exams. Meanwhile, memorizing random things like the type of material that reading lenses are made of is required for the test. Funnily enough, such random facts, are only shown one time, on this one slide, in this one lecture for a minute. There are even questions on the exam requiring you to use brand-new equations you've never used before, found somewhere on the slides, possibly in the tiniest writing, and with zero explanation as to what each variable in the equation means. So ultimately, even if you manage to self-teach yourself the entire course, you may still get royally screwed. To top it off this teacher will ask you to purchase anything for his class, including software with no notice. Day of the class, prof waltzes in, telling us we need to buy a peer grading software for $30 to submit our assignments, oh and the first assignment, which we were also just hearing about, was due the following day………. the hell! Did you realize that I said, “peer grading software”? So yes, students are marking and evaluating other students’ work and providing feedback to those evaluations. In the end, the prof and Tas will still mark your work and bring down the grade that the students gave you. Thus making this platform a complete waste of your time and money, particularly since there are platforms that other teachers use at this school to do the same thing for free. No surprise that many students were failing his quizzes, especially when there were so few questions on the quiz to do in even lesser time. One question easily translates to 4.5% - 10% of your grade. What makes this better is that for calculation questions, you have to get the EXACT number in order to get the answer correct, so if you have 0.0025 and he has 0.0026, you just lost 10%. Did I mention that if you cumulatively fail the quizzes, you fail the course? He will automatically fail you. All grades aside from the quiz grades become NULL AND VOID, they won’t count towards your final average. So you, my friend would have double wasted your money on that software and all materials you bought for the labs, all the time and effort you spent doing the other course work would have been for nothing. Just in case you are hoping for a curve, get that out of your mind right now. THERE IS NO CURVE, however, you may be selected for an interview where you get 20 mins to make a speech, and/ or be grilled with questions about the different topics that made up the quiz you failed. If you do well on the interview, who knows, you may get 3% added to your failed quiz. This is a one-time thing, so I hope you won't fail more than one quiz and I for sure hope that if you do fail one that it was only like a 47% on that quiz.

This course is very helpful and applicable to students, since it deals with I/O and data abstraction, and I have applied some of the concepts learned in this course (taught in C) in my own side projects (written in python). However, there were too many issues holding it back. First, Seashell is an outdated platform and it needs to be updated. I understand why the university uses it, but it often logs the user out while they are working, which is incredibly annoying. Also, the office hours were horrendous all around. Unlike cs135, where each student took 5 minutes tops and there were enough instructors and TA/ISAs to deal with the demand, often there is only one teacher, and each student takes around 15 minutes. As a result, unless you jump into the queue exactly when the office hours start, expect to wait an hour or two for your turn, or not get a turn at all (one time, I waited over 3 hours in line after joining the queue within the first 15 minutes and I never got my turn.)

This class destroyed that balance. I spent countless hours every week trying to understand everything, and truthfully quite a but of it I understood after working towards it. I was never terrible at math, but there were those units that I definitely found harder than others. I didn't use the textbook past the midterm because my prof's notes stopped paralleling the content which made it difficult to teach myself- because yes you need to do that this whole course. Keith KILLED ME - I tried so hard being respectful in my emails but he almost broke me. So here's the thing about him... he gives good notes that he posts about the lessons and STUDY THOSE if you can. Those are what he bases exams and quizzes after. BUT - he also encourages students to work through problems on their own first to try and understand the material, which yes seems like a good idea, but he also has a policy of refusing to help students with questions when his quizzes are open - BUT THERE'S ALWAYS A QUIZ OPEN AND AVAILABLE - so this man NEVER answers questions which is extremely wrong because we as students are paying for him TO TEACH and how do we learn if he doesn't help?? 10/10 Recommend investing in chegg over the textbook for this course and don't be shy from Quizlet - trust me when I say it's a much better investment. For the midterm a tip is to throw multiple choice questions from past quizzes into a doc so you can just use ctrl+f or command-f to search through questions. If you work your butt off you'll get through, but MAKE STUDY GROUPS - step away from your social anxiety and just do it cause dude everyone is suffering in this class, but asking questions between one another will be a life saver.

"This is coming from a 1st year undergrad who did ok in high school Physics (even though I hated it). If you think PHYS 111 is disorganized, PHYS111L IS SOMETHING ELSE. I HATE THIS COURSE WITH A PASSION. Firstly, there is barely any background information on what to include on your lab reports, if there is, it is too broad. With that in mind Seeing as I receive a different TA marking my assignments each time, the overall requirements do not even matter when the TAs have there own preferences. The communication of content and ideas related to concepts taught in PHYS 111 is horrendous. Yes I got to conduct cool experiments which I enjoyed but there weren't any set in stone guidelines for what values to include in your lab report. The whole premise behind this course is that it gives you the freedom to examine and improve your experiment but that idea is really just a façade. If you don't like physics do not take this course. If physics is your forte, go for it! The content is just 5 labs but the TAs/instructor barely communicate the proper guidelines as if they want you to fail and retake it again. It only thing I really learned was how to apply physics equations to real life matters which really is not unique or mind blowing in any sense. My last words of advice, if you are planning on taking this course and you are not well rounded in PHYS 111 AVOID at all COUNTS. If you are planning on going to med school, Biomedical sciences at waterloo is great but Biology would be a better choice. (Yes there is physics on the mcat but it is better to review these concepts on your own time rather then risk you own GPA with disorganized courses like these.)

"Alright so, this course was somewhat of a dumpster fire. Allow me to tell you the tale of STAT 202, Fall 2018. Riley Metzger, later known as the Ghost of Riley, taught both sections of the course by himself for about 2 weeks before he got AIDS or something and completely disappeared without explanation. The good thing about Riley was his grade breakdown was very easy. NO EXAM, 3 NON-CUMULATIVE midterms worth 20% each, 10% in-class clickers (2/5 marks for an incorrect answer, 5/5 for correct). 10% tutorial clickers (same marking scheme). Also, clicker grades get multiplied by 1.15 at the end, and there's a 40 mark bonus that goes into the in class clicker if you register by a certain date. 10% online quizzes with unlimited attempts. 10% assignments (best 3/4 taken, later changed to 2/3 [foreshadowing how this course ran]). Essentially, this was not only a free 40%, but more. For example, my final clicker grade was about 125%. You could basically get an 85 in this class without knowing any statistics (believe me), provided you take advantage of the free 40. This was the only good thing about Riley. To offset this, it was very clear that Riley intended to make the midterms absolute slaughters. He did not plan on giving us any formulas, and his examples in class were way too simple, and you could tell he was gonna make them much more difficult on the tests. Also, Riley tried to have us learn R (a programming language) in the tutorials, which appeared on midterms. This class was 99% science students with 0 interest in programming, so I'm not sure what he was thinking. I could write a dissertation about only how useless and disorganized the R tutorials were. Once Riley got AIDS though, the course was taken over by Dina Dawoud and James Adcock. Both of them did a fine job considering how abruptly they were thrust into running someone else's course. Also, they realized that Riley not giving us a formula sheet violated the Geneva Convention and decided to bless us with one. Riley seemingly was too ill to contribute to midterm 1, evidenced by his name not being on it, as it was very straightforward and the class average was high (78). Apparently his AIDS symptoms regressed in time for midterm 2, but the AIDS also became contagious, because midterms 2 and 3 had his name and were much, much harder (averages were 69 after a denominator drop, and 63). I can only imagine how low the averages would have been if only Riley wrote them and we were not given formula sheets. Riley also apparently did not create the assignments for this course ahead of time, as Dina and James did not give a fourth one to us. Overall, this course was a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

I took this course online and I did not really like that aspect, but I think it would be better than going to lectures. They really emphasized revision in the course so you had to submit a draft paper for peer review, a ""final for now"" paper, and then for a final portfolio, where you had to submit two essays which you revised again. The draft papers I submitted for review were rushed just to meet the deadline and the ""final for now"" paper was the one getting marked so that is when I spent some time actually trying to write well. The final portfolio is where they ask you to resubmit all your work for these two essays and a final reflection. I submitted my best two essays and this was a mistake. I did not change them significantly because I was unsure what I needed to do for the final revision, so I ended up with a worse mark on my portfolio than the marks I received the first time around for the essays.

Terrible course for multiple reasons. 1. The way the course is structured makes it useless. I thought I would actually learn how to use GIS but I did not. I had to follow the videos provided exactly or else my mark gets dropped. There is no room for creativity or to actually learn how to use ArcGIS. Take geog 181 if you want to learn GIS and aren't required to take 342. 2. The marking in this course is horrific. I lost marks for the stupidest of reasons and I truly believe they try to make you lose marks to keep the average down. If you make one small mistake you fail the questions there are barely any part marks. I am also about to write the exam and the mark distribution makes no sense. Why would 60 marks be given to 20 multiple choice questions when there is only one right answer. 3. My final point is that studying for the exam is difficult with the way Changcheng structured his awful course. He provides videos on Learn for you to watch before the lecture then you spend the actual lecture doing iClicker questions. For some reason though Changcheng is against giving us answers so all the questions posed in the video lectures have no answers. All in all do not take this course unless required.

"This was honestly the worst course I had ever taken. I almost dropped out of the program entirely because of it. The course is split up into 2 portions: DCAP and EGAD. DCAP was all about writing really long reports and wasting time. It required you to write ""nice and meaningful"" comments to each other online. What would actually happen is that many groups would just fake entire conversations to earn good marks and actually criticize each other's designs in person, or by another means of communication. Most of the reports you'll have to prepare as a team will also be quite lengthy and time consuming. It's way worse if you're the only one doing any of the work as well as it's all marked as a team effort. It may also require a lot of BS throughout. However, none of this even compares to the horror that was EGAD. This was basically a drawing class. If you are not naturally talented at drawing, be prepared to waste 3-5 hours every week per assignment and still get 50s and 60s every week. The standards are insanely high, and you'll normally have about 5 assignments every week form this half of the course alone. Freehands are definitely the worst form of torture brought upon form 1A. They're not even worth your time as you'll run out of time studying for every other class. AutoCAD and Solidworks are also taught in this class, but those assignments still take hours and hours to complete for subpar grades. The quizzes are also nearly impossible to prepare for.

Next, the learning assessments (aka tests). They either did not give us enough time to do the tests, or they marked them extremely unfairly. In Laura's eyes, ""uploading the reputation of the program"" means ensuring the course average stays low, not grading students based on their work. On top of all this, Laura decided not to record the lectures when the course was offered only online, so all students (including those living in different time zones) had to figure out a way to show up to lectures and listen to her talk for 3 hours a week.

"There's a lot of free marks from handing in hwk problems (10%), course summary and news article (10%) and participation (10%). Tip for participation: they say that ""saying 2 things per class warrants a good mark"" but that's a lie. If you only say 2 things, that will only get you a 75% for participation. The midterms are very doable (usually 80% average) but their marking scheme is bad. Basically you get your paper back with a lot of checkmarks (up to 64 checkmarks per big question). They add the checkmarks up, then multiply it by the ""weight"" of the question to get your mark. REAL EXAMPLE from my MT: Let's say you get 45 checkmarks out of 64 total checkmarks. If the question is worth 27 points (27%) out of 100 point and checkmarks are weighted at 0.42, then you do 45 checkmarks*0.42 = 19 marks/ 27 marks. See how UNNECESSARY that is? If they state that the question is worth 27 points out of 100 on the front page of my midterm, why on earth do they need to come up with the checkmark grading system? It would make much more sense for me to only see 27 possible checkmarks on my midterm. It is so difficult to see where you lost marks because all you see are checkmarks. Also, they don't do CF marks. If you miss a number, your ending balance will be off and you won't see any checkmarks there..",Exam,2,Medium,1,Examination Dept,2_Uwaterloo_course_reviews_with_sampling_criteria.csv

Course organization was atrocious, as previous reviewers have mentioned - if a well-organized basic first-year algebra course was an identity matrix, and MATH 136 from previous terms (assuming neutral levels of organization) was matrix A, then the instruction/organization team multiplied matrix A by itself (instead of its inverse) to get the matrix for the MATH 136 of Winter 2021. Much of this resulted in lack of solutions posted for some assignment questions, which was highly unhelpful for learning and studying purposes. Profs and TAs would give contradicting answers on Piazza and then criticize students for asking the same question (regarding different assignments) - we wouldn't have repeatedly clarified the same question if they were giving a clear, unified answer.

"Don't take this course if Prof. Busch is teaching it. Plain and simple. I took this during the pandemic and when the course was online-only so your mileage might vary. The course content itself is very useful and necessary - you need to know everything taught here if you plan to pursue anything related to Economics in the future (especially welfare economics). But it's math-heavy and, unless you know what you're doing/what is being asked, you'll have a BAD time. Which is exactly the problem when Prof Busch teaches it - he rarely explains things clearly (you'll know the difference if you had Prof. Ozkardas for ECON 290), will hardly give you practice problems for you to get better at the course with (don't be surprised if he teaches you something new and then promptly tests that 2 days later) and he'll always maintain a passive-aggressive tone with you for any suggestions for improvement.

We were told on the syllabus we would write 8 quizzes and only 6 were given, which gave some confusion. The midterm was fair, though it was all short answers. The group project was frustrating in that as a result of lack of time and planning, some groups did not feel rushed while others had to stay 25 minutes past class in order to present for about 3 minutes because group members had other commitments.

"TLDR: Course content is interesting.Beginning everyone knew what they were doing, midterms were bimodal, finals were absolute shit because most of the exam was proofs that clapped everyone into the abyss ----------------- FULL: The course, overall, was alright. The course content minus the proofs is pretty useful and interesting (because who needs trivial proofs as an engineer, right?) Beginning things were pretty easy and quiz averages were 80. Midterms; things hit differently for everyone and while some people passed with 90s, others had border 50s. Meanwhile quiz averages went from 80s to 75 to 70s by linear transformations. Finally by eigenvectors averages were 65ish. Most profs in the last 2 lessons were teaching content that was 80% of the final. Apparently Trelford's been making the course more proof-based rather than plug n chug styled as of 2017, probably why the 2018 average was pretty bad. The practice test that was sent out was light/medium difficulty and was very doable compared to the exam. Needless to day the fact that most of the exam was proofs rather than computations is probably the reason the average for the final was probably low-mid 50 (out of the 20 people I talked to). Everyone got clapped really hard. If i had to retake the course I would not sleep on the proofs, spanning sets, vector spaces. Honestly, just use Trelford and Resch's notes like the bible and study from them; know everything from their course notes and important proofs.

"I fail to see how this course fits in the MAcc program. It's essentially an Online Course but I cannot gather any interests for it, since the readings, teachings, and assignments are useless. The readings do not reinforce the required work. I did all my assignments without having to read anything. The teachings were also not necessary since I did not attend a single lecture. The fact that there were literally no expectations for students to show up or care (since you're capped at 80%) is a big turnoff for students. The readings were lengthy, boring, outdated, and not interesting at all. Most assignments are full of typos and as if someone came up with them last minute. The entire course is focused on such a niche area of law, yet it's so simple that I can essentially do the entire course in 1 week. Most students did their submissions by the first half of the course, and did nothing (thus learned nothing) for the 2nd half, and the instructor made little efforts to make us learn. The instructor fails to invoke our interests in the course and he doesn't care about our well-being either. Instructor refuses any regrades and claims that he's ""busy"" and declines meetings with students who wish to improve, despite only teaching 2 courses. If you cannot commit to teach (due to side projects or research), then don't teach. Our tuition in MAcc is high, and we do not want a course that adds no value to our professional careers. The students who marked our assignments and papers are not even Waterloo students. Fairness & objectivity in grading is a serious flaw in this course. There was absolutely no feedback provided when you get marks taken off. People often ask, ""are these TAs even qualified to mark our assignments""? I bet as a MAcc student, we write better than them, yet they are taking marks off for grammar and other unknown reasons. Every class, MAcc students repeatedly complain to Charters that we don't understand his rationale of capping everyone at 80%. If we deserve a 100%, and there's no way to improve any further, then we deserve 100%. The forced distribution system placed upon the class really discourages the students who wanted to work hard. The students have the mentality that, ""no matter what you do, you're going to get a 80% anyways"". The students who do all the readings, spent hours researching and compiling, gets the same mark as a student who crammed everything in 1 hour.

"Very difficult course. Online offering of this course consists of watching prerecorded lectures, which in my opinion were of high quality and concise. However, these videos and the course notes are the only materials you can learn from. The practice problems do not come with solutions (only the tutorial problems have solutions). The instructors do not answer questions on Piazza, instead they host office hours where you can ask your questions. Make sure to go to these office hours early in the week and not the night before an assignment is due. Assignments were difficult due to inconsistent marking schemes and poor communication from the instructors. This is caused by the very limited communication between instructors and students since instructors seem to communicate only through office hours and private e-mails. The course also has three midterms (or tests, as they call it). These tests aim to assess students' knowledge of the previous 3 or 4 weeks content. Many students including myself found the time limit (60 minutes + 20 minutes for uploading) to be not enough for these types of questions. TLDR: - Learn through pre recorded lectures (high quality and concise) and course notes (if you want to read them) - Instructors do not answer questions on Piazza - Limited communication between instructors and students leading to miscommunications (although this is appearing to improve now) - Difficult assignments and tests (expected because this course is quite difficult overall)",Exam,2,Medium,1,Examination Dept,2_Uwaterloo_course_reviews_with_sampling_criteria.csv

I almost bombed the first lab report but got almost perfect on the second one so I cant complain too much. After I got my first lab back I found out I got reported to the dean for an academic offence because I didn't cite something properly, and then I found out the TAs went crazy with reporting and almost half the class thought they were gonna get kicked out of school.

"You have to finish the lab report by the end of the session. First two labs were manageable and understandable if you spend a few hours reading the manual and attending the prelab to understand the equipment you are working with... Afterwards, you are required to do a std. deviation analysis on large data sets IN CLASS BY HAND! Tbh how could you possibly finish everything in 2h50min, when you have to do the experiment, analyse so much data, and explain it too! In the last 3 labs I found myself scrambling to piece the report together. I was blessed that one of my TAs is very smart and knows the experiment inside out, but too bad the amount of time given is way too little to complete the report even if you prepare ahead of time. The labs are too math intensive to be finished in time. So my tip would be to get as many marks as possible in the first 2 labs and just do the best you could in the last 3. For the parts you don't finish, do a sample calculation and explain your thought process. But other than that, might just have to pray you get a good TA... First year physics lab in UW kinda sucks.

Most people were too lost and bored during the ""lectures"" to even know what to ask. The 2 assignments in the course were the 2 toughest assignments of my entire degree. Extremely ambiguous and requires you to learn the entire course on your own. Only thing this course lives up to is it's difficulty. I would strongly recommend to anyone taking this course to have a strong background in algorithms and data structures, multivariable control systems, multivariate statistics, non-linear optimization, and graph theory. I completed a math minor and I could barely understand any of the math in this course. None of these things are taught properly throughout the course (And most of these topics are definitely not in any undergraduate engineering program) but you'll be expected to know them. Strong programming skills are an absolute must to survive (At a level far greater than previous academic courses). Overall, the course could actually be really interesting.

The lab component (30%) felt pretty disorganized, and a lot of the labs we had to rush to get the experiments done within the 3 hours. The lab reports were marked similarly to biol 240L (pretty harsh), but make sure you have extremely detailed discussions that address every single result to get a decent mark.

If your TA doesn't care and you've never done physics in high school, this course will be extremely hard and require a lot of studying in your free time, especially if physics isn't something that comes naturally. We were told by Tan to not ask questions and my TA would often ask my question back to me, tell me they weren't allowed to answer my question, or say something like ""well would do you think"" which isn't very helpful if you genuinely don't know what you're doing. I also found Tan very condescending? During the first lab, I was struggling with the ""improvements for the lab"" section and when I asked for feedback he essentially told me it was terrible, he's seen kids do better, and offered little feedback or suggestions. He also did not show up to the many subsequent labs so you're completely reliant on your TA (and I feel like I didn't have a great one) tldr: how much your TA likes teaching determines how much fun you'll have in this course, if you aren't good at physics please avoid at all costs.

They try to teach through immersion, but you need first to learn and understand how the German language works with conjugation/sentence structure before you can just learn by having a teacher ask you a bunch of questions in German. Also, it was VERY confusing and disorganized online with what was due on what day. Exercises due in the exercise book, but then exercises also due in the textbook, then potentially optional-maybe-graded exercises in the cultural reader, and then additional weekly homework projects assigned online - different than the weekly homework assigned by the teachers in class. The labs didn't even practice speaking - just more writing with confusing exercises that we never had time to finish without staying 10-20 mins after class. In contrast, SPAN 101 and 102 is laid out very well - and the online course material is very well put together. I recommend avoiding GER 101.

"Course was relatively easy, and very useful for future applications (teaches you all about how to use Excell scientifically). Unfortunately, can't say the same for the teaching. Fans were blazing loudly and microphones weren't used until the last few labs, so it was very difficult for those at the back to hear anything. On top of that, half of the TA's don't even know what they're doing and some don't even provide help The grading as well was awful, way more emphasis was put towards 'disucssion questions' at the end of the lab than the actual lab itself. Normally that would be fine, but they're so brutal when it comes to marking them. They say not to put too much info, but if you put too little they end up roasting you for not including enough information but then if you think you've put a fair amount of detail, they still roast you for putting ""too much"" Kindly look into this issue.",Lab,12,High,0,Facilities Management,finalDataset0_2.xlsx
