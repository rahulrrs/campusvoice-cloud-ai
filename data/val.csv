"They say this is a continuation to AFM373, but this course is way easier. I think when Blake and Ecclestone taught this before, it was actually hard, but with Alan Huang and JAD, it's not that bad. The only problem is, it's too easy and the things you learn are too useless. 373 focused a lot on valuations, DCF, synergies and financial modelling. This course was purely theoretical and bsing. Our final exam on derivatives, had no derivatives in it and was rather a strategies case like AFM433. While in equities from Alan Huang we learned some interesting theories, they are not that practical in real life. Ecclestone would let students do stock simulations and so on, this course has none of those practical applications. It almost feels like they try too hard not to teach students finance (knowing this is for CPA students), it seems like we didn't learn much in this course. Presentations take up way too much time. Students are just not paying attention whenever people are presenting, there's nothing to do. Yet we should have spent that time wasted on actually learning finance. Peer critiquing was a big problem too. People just snake each other no matter how well you do. This course is very disorganized and you honestly don't learn any finance. If you are actually interested, take 424 + 322. This course is rushed in a way that you don't even get to go too deep on any topic. Derivatives was especially plain. All the hedging stuff you learned from AFM121. Grading was also very subjective. When you are at 4B, the people who mark your finance cases are ""industry professionals"". But they are very unprofessional when they mark stuff, taking marks off for things such as no page numbers, formatting, or font size. Marks wise it is ok. Everyone got around high 70s to 80s. The profs are nice too. It's just that the course itself is not very useful. They honestly should just make AFM students mandatory taking afm424 and 322.

The only good things I can say about this course is that it doesn't have any exams and that the profs aren't horrible. In fact, some of them acknowledge how pointless this all is. Overall, I'm shocked that this course is still a thing and that it replaced MATH 109. AFM 111 needs to be either removed or completely overhauled.

"This was honestly the worst course I had ever taken. I almost dropped out of the program entirely because of it. The course is split up into 2 portions: DCAP and EGAD. DCAP was all about writing really long reports and wasting time. It required you to write ""nice and meaningful"" comments to each other online. What would actually happen is that many groups would just fake entire conversations to earn good marks and actually criticize each other's designs in person, or by another means of communication. Most of the reports you'll have to prepare as a team will also be quite lengthy and time consuming. It's way worse if you're the only one doing any of the work as well as it's all marked as a team effort. It may also require a lot of BS throughout. However, none of this even compares to the horror that was EGAD. This was basically a drawing class. If you are not naturally talented at drawing, be prepared to waste 3-5 hours every week per assignment and still get 50s and 60s every week. The standards are insanely high, and you'll normally have about 5 assignments every week form this half of the course alone. Freehands are definitely the worst form of torture brought upon form 1A. They're not even worth your time as you'll run out of time studying for every other class. AutoCAD and Solidworks are also taught in this class, but those assignments still take hours and hours to complete for subpar grades. The quizzes are also nearly impossible to prepare for. Overall, this course may destroy your average explicitly, or implicitly from the hours you wasted on it. It will be far easier to boost your average by doing even better in all of your other classes.

"This class had AMAZING content, lectures, and topics but unfortunately, it has to have been the most disorganized and frustrating class in my whole entire University career so far as a second-year student. To give this course a fair and honest review I will go into it with plenty of depth. Topic-wise I was hooked. I enjoyed learning about protests, criminal law actors, gender, children and youth justice etc, and honestly the lectures were quite relaxed and VERY helpful for the midterm and exams. No lecture slides (which many students disliked)... but I actually found this helpful because the weekly agenda in this course is attending the (1) lecture and (2) break out group... then (3) take notes and you will ace the exams. The breakdown of assignments were okay but I found the marking to be ALL over the place and incohesive. As a strict A or A+ student I was surprised with my low 80 grade on both the written assignment and the oral presentation, and MANY students were appalled with their presentation marks as NO critiques were given yet ended with a low 80. The grades for our Test 1 changed approximately 3 times in the system and it was just all over the place. I am writing this on April 24 and can confidently say this is the ONLY class that I am missing 3/6 marks for this late in the term. I have every single solitary mark back (minus exams) in every other course. Students in this class overall have discussed how frustrating and unorganized this is. The professor also makes emailing impossible. Quite literally any small email question will be replied to with ""join office hours."" The wait for office hours is approx. 30-1.5 hours. I found this ridiculous and AGAIN the only class I have had so far where emailing was made impossible by the professor. I also know that many students struggled with the fact that lectures were not recorded and if you were sick there was no way other than sharing notes to receive the lecture content (again noting that lecture slides ceased to exist). Overall nice content but extremely disorganized and received lower marks than I was expecting yet this was the easiest LS course I have ever taken.

"Taken W22, this course is an absolute mess. There is a lab and a lecture component, both of which are taught completely separate from each other and by 2 different teachers. For the lab portion, there was practically no feedback given so you didn't know where you went wrong. Students brought this up to the teaching team. Instructors recommended going to the TAs for help, however twice when I emailed TAs with questions I received no response. In person labs were slightly better as you could ask questions to the prof/ta right there. However class averages for both the midterm and exam were at a shocking low despite being online and open book. The actual lectures themselves were fine and naturally were better in person than online. However there are no assignments for the lecture content, no practice problems, no mock midterm/exam. The only times you ever get to apply the content you learned are on the midterm and exam leaving you completely unaware of what is expected or if you actually understand the concepts until it is too late.

"If you think AFM433 is bs, then you DO NOT take this course! This is by far the most bs course I've ever taken in SAF, especially with Zamal teaching it. ACC685 is CPA elective and is supposed to be a much enhanced version of ACC680, yet Zamal only focuses on the strategy part and nothing on cost or quants and the course is entirely full of bs. A simple strategy case that could have been taught in 1 lecture is split into 3 full classes, you literally learn nothing. The cases are outdated, long, and made no sense (because it was not written for CPA purposes, but for MBA Harvard/Ivey) Zamal is actually very lazy and he makes no effort in updating course material and claims that nothing has changed over the past 20 years and therefore we use the slides from 20 years ago. Also, he tries to bs his way out whenever he doesn't know the answers, which occurs often. Many of us took this course because we heard it was ""bird"". This is not the case this year. What happened is that Zamal was too lazy and he didn't change the midterm/final from the previous year, so the entire class from the year before got 90s. For our year, he totally screwed us over by making 2 hard cases for midterm and gave us all low marks for participation, assignment, and exams. By the way, he makes ""C"" only a 90%, so even if you get a ""C"" on your case, which is under CPA standards - perfect score, you won't get a 100% on your case. He's effectively capping your performance at 90% (max you'll get), and he makes RC a 70% when it's supposed to be a 75%. This course DOES NOT help you prepare your CFE. If you think you're going to take PM role, then just spend more effort on 680 with Nancy and Janet because you learn more from them. There are not many PM role cases available since CFE started in 2015, but he makes no effort to make it better. He could have asked Nancy and used some of her cases or modified them, or just use CPA cases, but no, he just continued using the previous prof's cases because he's that lazy. He also never replies his email, and never holds office hours (since he commutes). Good luck trying to reach him for help because he's not willing to. Would you still take a course that is difficult, where you learn nothing, and has nothing to do with CPA?

"Let me just start off saying this is not supposed to be a difficult course. It takes some cost knowledge from 481 and you use it to evaluate performance (like 433 stuff). It somehow became the hardest course in 4B because both ducharme and carty were totally incompetent in teaching and the course is delivered in such a disorganized way that no one really learned anything. The midterm and final was so hard that averages for midterm was around 50% and final was around 30%. But they refused to curve and lied about class average, claiming it's 72% for the midterm. The textbook is really bad. It contains so much 481 stuff that the profs themselves don't know whether to focus on the cost part or the PM part. We did a lot of practice questions on cost accounting, but exams are all bs questions, it won't matter if you study or not. Final exam was a huge variance question that accounted for more than half of the exam. Their objective was to make sure we don't make MAcc. Lynn Carty was the worst. She is not qualified to teach, she doesn't know her stuff at all. When people ask her in class she would say that she doesn't know the answer, and she memorized everything back in undergrad, and now she has to teach, she has to learn everything again. While that may be a joke, we didn't even find it remotely entertaining. She wants everyone to fail because she is pissed that she never made AFM back in UW.

"An incredible amount of this course is so vastly beyond the scope of a first year's level. With the exception of a few units, like those of gravitation, special relativity, photons and the part of the nuclear physics module that actually bothered with nuclear physics, the subject matter appeared to me as if I had missed several years worth of physics and math pre-requisites. The first tutorial was interestingly called a ""math review"" while introducing us to a great deal of new material revolving around complex numbers in a panic inducing rush. The tests were rather comical in how much they needed to be curved in order to get a somewhat reasonable average out of a total lack of understanding of the class for pretty much half the material, even with the generous grading. The entire unit of general relativity was so outlandishly beyond us, to the point it was wholly an exercise in futility, something professor Mann seemed to recognize, and assured us would not be tested on. And yet, a long and difficult graded assignment was still issued on it. I can understand showing us a general intro to GR's concepts, but actually going into its mathematics is ridiculous. What I did learn in this course was incredible and wonderful, and made it all the more unfortunate that such could not be done justice because this course tries to condense all of the frontiers of physics into a single course for first years. I understand and appreciate the idea is to introduce advanced concepts in order to get us acquainted and thinking about these ideas early so that we will be more receptive to them later on, but ultimately I doubt I will retain much if any of the concepts too advanced to be learned properly at this level. I would prefer to just learn such concepts at the appropriate level with the requisite background when the time comes, rather than cramming it in here where it is a huge stress for little if any gain, while simultaneously cutting short the other concepts introduced that are appropriate for first years.",Exam,2,Medium,1,Examination Department,2_Uwaterloo_course_reviews_with_sampling_criteria.csv

"Look... did you take high school English? Yes? Okay, you will pass this course. The main things you will need to focus on to do well on the report is the structure (depending on your department), and writing anything that is remotely researched and makes sense. Seriously, if you select a topic that you enjoy, writing will be a breeze. You'll likely want to give this course minimal focus, especially if you have other courses to deal with. This should not be taking up more than a few minutes of your time when doing the practice assignment and no more than a few days when doing the report. It took me 2 days to do my report and I got an 85, which just goes to show how easy it is. I would say researching relevant information and phrasing it correctly is really the only difficulty you will face, and again, it's not difficult.

"This course is useful in the sense that you're learning the basics of GIS which comes in handy for a lot of planning co-op jobs. However, depending on your TA you can do very well in the course or very bad. There's definitely discrepancies in the marking of the labs, which dictate 42% of your grade, so I highly suggest studying for the midterm and final exam in advance if you want to ensure you do well in the course. The mid-term is relatively easy to do well on if you study thoroughly the night in advance. However, I personally found the final a disaster because it consisted of 32 multiple choice questions, 7 short answer questions, and 4 essay questions. There's no time to write everything and the questions are difficult but since everyone will most likely fail the exam the professor is bound to belcurve the grades.",Exam,2,Medium,1,Examination Department,2_Uwaterloo_course_reviews_with_sampling_criteria.csv
