Neither does Manning. It would make sense that she doesn't want us to have the solutions so people come to class. But she doesn't post it AFTER class either. So essentially no one knows what the real case solution is and cannot practice effectively. What's worse is her participation marks. She never fking marks you. You don't get marks for just showing up in class, you have to talk. But she doesn't mark you down when you do. I ended up having a lower participation grade than the people who skip all her classes.

"One of the worst courses I've ever taken. Peter Bhur is an incredible lecturer, but his concurrency methods are irrelevant. Most of what you will learn in this course is not used in practice, usually because they are too complicated/incomprehensible, but sometimes because it's just not how people implemented it. There's a lot of cool little facts you'll learn in the course, but most of them are just little tidbits of knowledge that you talk about with people to impress them (did you know C can handle most exceptions?), and aren't useful. I honestly don't believe I've learned anything RELEVANT about concurrency that I didn't know already. The assignments in this course were the worst assignments I've ever had. About 70-80% of the time spent working on them was spent building time wasting things like output generators or trying to parse what the assignment was even asking. None of the assignment questions were hard, they were just time consuming, in the worst way. There was also no opportunity for creativity in problem solving; you were told exactly what to do, and exactly how to do it (usually in very confusing language), and any deviation would lose you marks. The marking on the assignments was insane. You will have marks taken off for things that aren't WRONG, but Buhr didn't do it that way, so you lose marks. You will lose marks for putting code in one perfectly reasonable place when Buhr put it somewhere else. You will lose marks for formatting your code differently that Buhr formats his code. I submitted an answer for a theoretical question once, in which you can come up with two different answers depending on how your interpret the problem, and submitted a full proof, and I got 30% on the question because Buhr got the other answer. They didn't say or explain why they thought my proof was wrong; I was simply wrong because Buhr did it another way. We also need to talk about micro C++. This is Buhr's language that he designed for concurrency, but nobody uses, except for this course. You'll quickly learn there are very good reasons nobody uses the language. The syntax is pretty bad, and there is essentially no documentation or help out there except for the documentation Buhr has. The language also has it's share of errors and bugs, which Buhr will most likely find throughout the term. I have counted 11 errors in the language that were solved by just remaking. In the end, I feel sad about this course. Concurrency is a very interesting topic, and Buhr is honestly the best lecturer I've ever had. If he took that passion and applied it to teaching useful things, and let someone else make and mark the assignments, I could have really loved this course. But as it stands, I would strongly suggest you don't take this course unless you absolutely have to. You'll learn more about concurrency from trying to build an Android app or making a toy concurrent system that you'll ever learn from this course.",Exam,2,High,0,Examination Department,2_Uwaterloo_course_reviews_with_sampling_criteria.csv

"I saw a review for another material science course (ME 115) that really embodied this course as well. So, I will use some of it here and just add a few points here there, so you know what makes this course really STAND OUT. THIS IS THEEEEE WORST COURSE I have ever taken and the most hated class in 2A for my cohort. The lectures were sooo……….boring and useless, which motivated most of the class to never show up. The textbook is completely useless as well, just pages and pages of conceptual ideas, and then just a bunch of numerical calculations you have no idea how to do. Often, they require you to make wild assumptions or just happen to memorize certain values about a property you would normally look for in a chart. The book barely and I mean barely skims the topic and then it tells you to google the rest for yourself. The tutorials are literally questions from the textbook, which usually does not relate to what it spoke about. The labs were poorly designed; students are sometimes required to buy or search for household items to carry out the experiment. The lab manual always presents a cheap, flimsy experimental setup in the form of a picture with very little organized and comprehensible instruction on how to actually set it up and carry out the procedure, which just of course led to way too many experimental errors, and thus the least accurate data possible. Many large concepts that were repeatedly mentioned throughout the course didn't show up once on the exams. Meanwhile, memorizing random things like the type of material that reading lenses are made of is required for the test. Funnily enough, such random facts, are only shown one time, on this one slide, in this one lecture for a minute. There are even questions on the exam requiring you to use brand-new equations you've never used before, found somewhere on the slides, possibly in the tiniest writing, and with zero explanation as to what each variable in the equation means. So ultimately, even if you manage to self-teach yourself the entire course, you may still get royally screwed. To top it off this teacher will ask you to purchase anything for his class, including software with no notice. Day of the class, prof waltzes in, telling us we need to buy a peer grading software for $30 to submit our assignments, oh and the first assignment, which we were also just hearing about, was due the following day………. the hell! Did you realize that I said, “peer grading software”? So yes, students are marking and evaluating other students’ work and providing feedback to those evaluations. In the end, the prof and Tas will still mark your work and bring down the grade that the students gave you. Thus making this platform a complete waste of your time and money, particularly since there are platforms that other teachers use at this school to do the same thing for free. No surprise that many students were failing his quizzes, especially when there were so few questions on the quiz to do in even lesser time. One question easily translates to 4.5% - 10% of your grade. What makes this better is that for calculation questions, you have to get the EXACT number in order to get the answer correct, so if you have 0.0025 and he has 0.0026, you just lost 10%. Did I mention that if you cumulatively fail the quizzes, you fail the course? He will automatically fail you. All grades aside from the quiz grades become NULL AND VOID, they won’t count towards your final average. So you, my friend would have double wasted your money on that software and all materials you bought for the labs, all the time and effort you spent doing the other course work would have been for nothing. Just in case you are hoping for a curve, get that out of your mind right now. THERE IS NO CURVE, however, you may be selected for an interview where you get 20 mins to make a speech, and/ or be grilled with questions about the different topics that made up the quiz you failed. If you do well on the interview, who knows, you may get 3% added to your failed quiz. This is a one-time thing, so I hope you won't fail more than one quiz and I for sure hope that if you do fail one that it was only like a 47% on that quiz.

"I fail to see how this course fits in the MAcc program. It's essentially an Online Course but I cannot gather any interests for it, since the readings, teachings, and assignments are useless. The readings do not reinforce the required work. I did all my assignments without having to read anything. The teachings were also not necessary since I did not attend a single lecture. The fact that there were literally no expectations for students to show up or care (since you're capped at 80%) is a big turnoff for students. The readings were lengthy, boring, outdated, and not interesting at all. Most assignments are full of typos and as if someone came up with them last minute. The entire course is focused on such a niche area of law, yet it's so simple that I can essentially do the entire course in 1 week. Most students did their submissions by the first half of the course, and did nothing (thus learned nothing) for the 2nd half, and the instructor made little efforts to make us learn. The instructor fails to invoke our interests in the course and he doesn't care about our well-being either. Instructor refuses any regrades and claims that he's ""busy"" and declines meetings with students who wish to improve, despite only teaching 2 courses. If you cannot commit to teach (due to side projects or research), then don't teach. Our tuition in MAcc is high, and we do not want a course that adds no value to our professional careers. The students who marked our assignments and papers are not even Waterloo students. Fairness & objectivity in grading is a serious flaw in this course. There was absolutely no feedback provided when you get marks taken off. People often ask, ""are these TAs even qualified to mark our assignments""? I bet as a MAcc student, we write better than them, yet they are taking marks off for grammar and other unknown reasons. Every class, MAcc students repeatedly complain to Charters that we don't understand his rationale of capping everyone at 80%. If we deserve a 100%, and there's no way to improve any further, then we deserve 100%. The forced distribution system placed upon the class really discourages the students who wanted to work hard. The students have the mentality that, ""no matter what you do, you're going to get a 80% anyways"". The students who do all the readings, spent hours researching and compiling, gets the same mark as a student who crammed everything in 1 hour. The lack of fairness further destroys any remaining value that is left in this course.",Exam,2,High,0,Examination Department,2_Uwaterloo_course_reviews_with_sampling_criteria.csv

"There's a lot of free marks from handing in hwk problems (10%), course summary and news article (10%) and participation (10%). Tip for participation: they say that ""saying 2 things per class warrants a good mark"" but that's a lie. If you only say 2 things, that will only get you a 75% for participation. The midterms are very doable (usually 80% average) but their marking scheme is bad. Basically you get your paper back with a lot of checkmarks (up to 64 checkmarks per big question). They add the checkmarks up, then multiply it by the ""weight"" of the question to get your mark. REAL EXAMPLE from my MT: Let's say you get 45 checkmarks out of 64 total checkmarks. If the question is worth 27 points (27%) out of 100 point and checkmarks are weighted at 0.42, then you do 45 checkmarks*0.42 = 19 marks/ 27 marks. See how UNNECESSARY that is? If they state that the question is worth 27 points out of 100 on the front page of my midterm, why on earth do they need to come up with the checkmark grading system? It would make much more sense for me to only see 27 possible checkmarks on my midterm. It is so difficult to see where you lost marks because all you see are checkmarks. Also, they don't do CF marks. If you miss a number, your ending balance will be off and you won't see any checkmarks there..",Exam,2,Medium,1,Examination Dept,2_Uwaterloo_course_reviews_with_sampling_criteria.csv

For example, calculation of Employment Income, Business Income, employment vs. self-employed will all be taught again, in more details. For example, you learn about traveller's and commission income for EI, you would learn more credits to use. Some of the things that we focused on in 362 will be less important here such as stock options benefit, auto benefit, what to include/exclude for employment income...and so on. After the midterm, however, many new concepts were introduced and it was so crammed with so many new things that the course was quite hard to catch up on. Something like AOC, Associated Corps, SRED, income vs. capital, could really be difficult to understand. For these new concepts, there were only like 1 practice question per concept (and the question is hard), so it's really hard to study for them. You really need to do your questions. The second part of the course was focused on concepts and our final had like no calculation (calculators weren't needed near the end). It was very strange. Midterm was a lot of calculation though. For your final, you need to memorize everything and take good notes on what he says in class. You really have to go to class. Finally, Rogo snaked us in the end. We all dropped like 10%. Maybe the average was too high (76% for midterm), or the assignments average was too high, he marked our final exams really hard. The final was really easy but the average was probably around 60%.

"I took this asynchronous so I can't say necessarily the same is true for in-person, but the course was overall really dry. As a disclaimer I never took econ before in high school. The course content had nonexistent explanations, motivation, applications, citations or justifications. It reminded me of memorisation-heavy high school courses that feed you information, never explaining why they are true or why you would ever need to know them. Some reviews below claim that most statements are common sense, but as someone who has never taken econ in high school, I find that there are several unjustified claims in the modules, such as ""why is ATC minimized when MC=AVC?"" I later found a proof of this using calculus, but nonetheless there is zero reason to expect this to be true using ""common sense"", nor was there any reasoning of this in the module. There were a lot of erroneous questions (like two MCQ choices are the same) on the quizzes, midterms and final, and you don't get the answers after each quiz, so overall the quality of the presentation and assessments were likewise nonexistent. They claim they hide the answers for copyright reasons but 90% of the questions can be found on quizlet. The textbook was completely unnecessary. Further, the prof's presence was nonexistent.

There were no synchronous or asynchronous lectures, and textbook readings were not really helpful towards doing the assignments either. So I don't feel that I really improved my writing skills much in this course (my marks stayed mostly consistent throughout which reflects this). There are 3 papers and a final portfolio in which you edit 2 of your papers. These assignments are pretty average in terms of workload. There are peer edits for the papers, but not often do you receive useful feedback, as most of us at this skill level are not too good at revising. Finally, in terms of grades it is easy enough to pass but to score high on the essays (80/90), you have to put in the work so don't think that this is a bird course.

Have fun implementing literally every data structure you use again. Apparently we need to know how to implement a linked list again, even though we did it so often in CS 138. Also have fun failing secret tests because of memory leaks, even though the memory leaks are 100% located in their test harness. I compared my executable to the sample executable they give to test your output against and my executable had half of the memory leaks. But you won't know that you'll failed secret tests until after the deadline because they don't even give you release tokens. The spec they give you for assignments is verbose, unclear and full of holes. You'll read literally 6 pages and still not know what to do. And then you'll have to read every post on Piazza just to have something small cleared up. It's a waste of time. Oh and the code they give you is ironically terrible.

She would randomly give extra credits on the assignment in the lectures even though they were all really obscure and basically guessing (I say this having gotten some). She continuously accused students of stopping her Teams recording multiple times even though it was her fault. The twice weekly quizzes had typos frequently, to get them right you had to guess whether or not it was an implication or typo. Textbook was useless, to understand I used another prof's course notes. We were forced to use Perusall, for which we were marked for ""productiveness"" of our conversations. Also the system tracking reading time underreported. The textbook was terrible, had too many typos (Linear Alg with Applications by Holt) had frequent wrong proofs. We were never actually taught how to do proofs despite class being supposedly an introduction. What would be one theorem in another class is 3+ in this textbook. This is very annoying when every assignment has you cite the EXACT theorem or definition number over and over, which wasted so much time. We had to do 3-4 textbook chapters/week no matter what, even if certain fundamental concepts that in other classes would be given an extra week were just zoomed through. Assignments had way too many questions, and hugely variable in time taken. Like 30+ random textbook questions every week. No joke, I spent 10 hours straight on an assignment and still didn't finish it. Most questions required ridiculous numbers of computations where each individual step had to be written down. The midterm had two typos, one was minor and the other fundamentally changed a question. She did not update the crowdmark with the fixed version, but sent out an email just slightly before the midterm saying the mistakes. Other than that was a fair exam. The final was impossible, it seemed like random questions out of the textbook with no regard to total time taken, where fundamental understanding was barely tested. I doubt the professor even made a key. By the end of the course there were 18 students left, 9 failed the exam.

"One of the biggest disappointments of 4th year. Course was an entire train wreck and nobody learnt anything. The labs were the toughest labs in my entire undergraduate degree. They could easily take over 6 hours just to implement onto the robot and we were never provided with the required theoretical background beforehand. Most people were too lost and bored during the ""lectures"" to even know what to ask. The 2 assignments in the course were the 2 toughest assignments of my entire degree. Extremely ambiguous and requires you to learn the entire course on your own. Only thing this course lives up to is it's difficulty. I would strongly recommend to anyone taking this course to have a strong background in algorithms and data structures, multivariable control systems, multivariate statistics, non-linear optimization, and graph theory. I completed a math minor and I could barely understand any of the math in this course. None of these things are taught properly throughout the course (And most of these topics are definitely not in any undergraduate engineering program) but you'll be expected to know them. Strong programming skills are an absolute must to survive (At a level far greater than previous academic courses). Overall, the course could actually be really interesting.
