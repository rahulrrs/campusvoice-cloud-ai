Extremely harsh marking with absolutely no mercy. We were all basically teaching ourselves this entire course, which in a regular term is difficult enough, only to be thrown curve balls at every opportunity by the professors and teaching staff. Never have I felt such a passionate disdain for such a course in Waterloo or school in general. I've had previous anxiety problems resurface because of the gross negligence of the professors who taught this course - do avoid them at all costs.

"Very difficult course. Online offering of this course consists of watching prerecorded lectures, which in my opinion were of high quality and concise. However, these videos and the course notes are the only materials you can learn from. The practice problems do not come with solutions (only the tutorial problems have solutions). The instructors do not answer questions on Piazza, instead they host office hours where you can ask your questions. Make sure to go to these office hours early in the week and not the night before an assignment is due. Assignments were difficult due to inconsistent marking schemes and poor communication from the instructors. This is caused by the very limited communication between instructors and students since instructors seem to communicate only through office hours and private e-mails. The course also has three midterms (or tests, as they call it). These tests aim to assess students' knowledge of the previous 3 or 4 weeks content. Many students including myself found the time limit (60 minutes + 20 minutes for uploading) to be not enough for these types of questions. TLDR: - Learn through pre recorded lectures (high quality and concise) and course notes (if you want to read them) - Instructors do not answer questions on Piazza - Limited communication between instructors and students leading to miscommunications (although this is appearing to improve now) - Difficult assignments and tests (expected because this course is quite difficult overall)",Exam,2,Medium,1,Examination Dept,2_Uwaterloo_course_reviews_with_sampling_criteria.csv

"Course was split in half, with Dr. Barbara Katzenback teaching the first midterm material, Dr. Brian Dixon teaching the second midterm material, and taking turns with the rest.

Readings were not helpful, and only a fraction of the reading was actually covered in class, making it a huge time sink with little return. Prechapter quizzes were suddenly dropped halfway through the course. For a course that was repeatedly stressed to be ""process driven"" and ""integrative"" and ""tying things together"", there was more hyperfocus on details like memorizing cytokine/chemokine/signalling names (eg. IL-1, IL-3, IL-6, CXCL7, CTLA-4, CD45, CD40L etc) with little effort in class to tie everything together. Midterm averages were in the 60 range, unsurprisingly.

The assesments are very simple: 4 quizes, 1 major assignment, a few smaller assignments, and no final exam. That said, the TA's for this course are egregiously inconsistent in thier marking. While professor John Johnston is very enthusiastic about the course content, if one were to ask him a question, there is a high chance that he answers with a non-answer or a question of his own. While this teaching method can be succesful in certain courses, it ends up being plain frustrating as this course is an introductory course taken by predominantly non-earth science students.

"This was a notably difficult course--it is not that the content is immensely challenging or that the concepts are tough to grasp, but rather, that the types of problems asked are of an intense difficulty that most 1A students have never seen before.

I personally found the midterm to be quite easy because I had a solid grasp of high school concepts and had a very good teacher in grade twelve, but the majority of people had a lot of trouble (the average was around a 55% in 2015). The final was more difficult, because the questions were of the same difficulty as the midterm, but were considerably longer and because we had far less exposure to the possible problem types for concepts like torque, rolling motion, static equilibrium, angular momentum, etc. If you want to excel in this course, you MUST do every practice problem that is assigned, and you should DEFINITELY do numerous practice midterms and finals to prepare for the exam (I did three for each and found myself trying to learn new problem types on the exams--do between five to ten to be maximally prepared).

"This course was a legitimate roller coaster of stress. This is my own fault but I left the first lab activity until the day of and freaked out over the amount of work that had to be done. About a month after I finished that activity (and after I had handed in 3 extra assignments) I got the first lab activity back, and my TA docked marks for stuff I didn't know I needed to include (because it wasn't in the rubric). About half way through I honestly considered dropping it but I'm glad I didn't because after the first couple assignments it gets so much less stressful. I almost bombed the first lab report but got almost perfect on the second one so I cant complain too much. After I got my first lab back I found out I got reported to the dean for an academic offence because I didn't cite something properly, and then I found out the TAs went crazy with reporting and almost half the class thought they were gonna get kicked out of school.

"This course is a big fat waste of time, effort, energy, blood, sweat, and tears. It's too much for a student who doesn't plan on pursuing a tax-based career, and a lot of what you learn will be heavily automated anyways. So there really is no point in it.

The profs don't post the solutions because ""they'll get in trouble"" - which is even more ironic considering that one of the profs WROTE the book! Another glaring flaw is the participation weighting. Essentially you have to properly participate in class 4-5 times to earn the full mark, which is pretty much impossible because the class acts like a hunger games arena anyways. Oh, and the people who take down your participation are the students themselves, so that's also another control deficiency!

"For me, pretty much everything in this course was new which made it one of the more challenging ones. The first thing to do is get a basic understanding of matrices if you've never used them. A lot of the other students had learned them in high school so it was harder for me to catch up. (Check out khanacademy.org for tutorials). Also imaginary numbers. Don't be confused by them, as long as you don't think about it too much they're very easy to work with. Another big part of the course is properties of conic functions (these are circles, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas), there will be a whole bunch of properties you've never heard of thrown at you here, all I can say is MEMORIZE and you'll be fine (and it's actually pretty cool). If I recall correctly there's a little section on converting numbers between decimal and binary number systems. This was insanely easy for me, simply because I knew my POWERS of TWO. Memorize them up to at least 2^10 and this will be a breeze. (Also knowing powers of two comes in handy for MANY applications down the road). The last thing comes back to matrices. You will hear the words Gaussian Elimination and Gauss-Jordan Elimination, and Row Echelon Form, and Reduced Row Echelon Form thrown around all over the place. Also ""forward elimination. backward substitution"". Learn explicitly what these things actually mean and what the differences are, so you can forget about all the silly words and just Do It.

"I have never been more disappointed with a class in my life. Reading the course description this class sounded so interested and I thought it would be my favourite course this term. Where do I even begin? The overall structure of the course is 6 quizzes weighing between 7%-24% and a poster presentation worth 33%. Their online lectures were very disorganized, and it was made evident that they don't have a great grasp on how Learn works and everyone was so lost. I also wanted to mention that they do not post their lecture slides, and some students have talked to them about this and they still didn't post them. Their actual lectures were them rambling on and on, and they were not that easy to follow. The quizzes were killer. The way they asked questions I didn't even know what they were asking half the time. They claim that their quizzes were all application questions, and these said questions sounded like a long jumbled up mess of random words and It was a rarity to get an 80+ (everyone i know got between 60s/70s and very few got 80s) on these quizzes. The lecture content they ask and the ""application"" they test you on are on completely different planes and I don't know how students ever do well i this course. They also talked about how that big poster presentation was a ""mark booster"" but the majority of people i spoke to got 70s on it so not really a boost.

This course is very helpful and applicable to students, since it deals with I/O and data abstraction, and I have applied some of the concepts learned in this course (taught in C) in my own side projects (written in python).

I understand why the university uses it, but it often logs the user out while they are working, which is incredibly annoying. Also, the office hours were horrendous all around. Unlike cs135, where each student took 5 minutes tops and there were enough instructors and TA/ISAs to deal with the demand, often there is only one teacher, and each student takes around 15 minutes. As a result, unless you jump into the queue exactly when the office hours start, expect to wait an hour or two for your turn, or not get a turn at all (one time, I waited over 3 hours in line after joining the queue within the first 15 minutes and I never got my turn.)

"I am currently taking this course online, and just like for all my other courses, I came into it with a degree of leniency since it is difficult to teach some courses online. But this whole course was just incredibly confusing. Firstly, in design courses, you just design a product addressing the situation of concern in the best possible way. However, the soc was incredibly specific, to the point where they were pretty much just telling us what to do. They forced us to delegate tasks in a very strict manner. You were discouraged from trying to do a bit of everything or even use each other's testing data. Marking has also been a mess. There are no rubrics, so most marks are just arbitrarily taken off and feedback is haphazard and stale. Instructions for deliverables are incredibly brief and open ended, but marking is very stringent. Furthermore the goal of this course is very unclear because we are not suppose to even achieve a functional prototype, despite being a prototyping course. I am almost done this course and I still don't know what the goal is, it was never actually defined. Very disappointing because these design courses are kind of the pillars of the syde departments and this felt like a waste of a course slot.",Exam,2,Medium,1,Examination Dept,2_Uwaterloo_course_reviews_with_sampling_criteria.csv

"This is coming from a 1st year undergrad who did ok in high school Physics (even though I hated it). If you think PHYS 111 is disorganized, PHYS111L IS SOMETHING ELSE. I HATE THIS COURSE WITH A PASSION. Firstly, there is barely any background information on what to include on your lab reports, if there is, it is too broad. With that in mind Seeing as I receive a different TA marking my assignments each time, the overall requirements do not even matter when the TAs have there own preferences. The communication of content and ideas related to concepts taught in PHYS 111 is horrendous. Yes I got to conduct cool experiments which I enjoyed but there weren't any set in stone guidelines for what values to include in your lab report. The whole premise behind this course is that it gives you the freedom to examine and improve your experiment but that idea is really just a façade. If you don't like physics do not take this course. If physics is your forte, go for it! The content is just 5 labs but the TAs/instructor barely communicate the proper guidelines as if they want you to fail and retake it again. It only thing I really learned was how to apply physics equations to real life matters which really is not unique or mind blowing in any sense. My last words of advice, if you are planning on taking this course and you are not well rounded in PHYS 111 AVOID at all COUNTS. If you are planning on going to med school, Biomedical sciences at waterloo is great but Biology would be a better choice. (Yes there is physics on the mcat but it is better to review these concepts on your own time rather then risk you own GPA with disorganized courses like these.)

"One of the biggest disappointments of 4th year. Course was an entire train wreck and nobody learnt anything. The labs were the toughest labs in my entire undergraduate degree. They could easily take over 6 hours just to implement onto the robot and we were never provided with the required theoretical background beforehand. Most people were too lost and bored during the ""lectures"" to even know what to ask. The 2 assignments in the course were the 2 toughest assignments of my entire degree. Extremely ambiguous and requires you to learn the entire course on your own. Only thing this course lives up to is it's difficulty. I would strongly recommend to anyone taking this course to have a strong background in algorithms and data structures, multivariable control systems, multivariate statistics, non-linear optimization, and graph theory. I completed a math minor and I could barely understand any of the math in this course. None of these things are taught properly throughout the course (And most of these topics are definitely not in any undergraduate engineering program) but you'll be expected to know them. Strong programming skills are an absolute must to survive (At a level far greater than previous academic courses). Overall, the course could actually be really interesting.

Prechapter quizzes were suddenly dropped halfway through the course.

He also did clickers which provided a VERY MUCH needed 5% participation marks. I know that the other sections who didn't have him as a prof did not do clickers, so the 5% was weighted elsewhere. The average on the midterm was low. Be warned that a lot of the questions you will get are VERY application based. The final consisted of about 8 or 10 (can't remember) long answer questions, each out of 20 marks. Even if you don't understand the question, try to do something to get SOME part marks! Also I'm pretty sure the final was curved because it was tricky. The online quizzes (worth 20%) were also pretty annoying since they were only out of 3, so if you get 2 wrong you got a 33%.

"Alright so, this course was somewhat of a dumpster fire. Allow me to tell you the tale of STAT 202, Fall 2018. Riley Metzger, later known as the Ghost of Riley, taught both sections of the course by himself for about 2 weeks before he got AIDS or something and completely disappeared without explanation. The good thing about Riley was his grade breakdown was very easy. NO EXAM, 3 NON-CUMULATIVE midterms worth 20% each, 10% in-class clickers (2/5 marks for an incorrect answer, 5/5 for correct). 10% tutorial clickers (same marking scheme). Also, clicker grades get multiplied by 1.15 at the end, and there's a 40 mark bonus that goes into the in class clicker if you register by a certain date. 10% online quizzes with unlimited attempts. 10% assignments (best 3/4 taken, later changed to 2/3 [foreshadowing how this course ran]). Essentially, this was not only a free 40%, but more. For example, my final clicker grade was about 125%. You could basically get an 85 in this class without knowing any statistics (believe me), provided you take advantage of the free 40. This was the only good thing about Riley. To offset this, it was very clear that Riley intended to make the midterms absolute slaughters. He did not plan on giving us any formulas, and his examples in class were way too simple, and you could tell he was gonna make them much more difficult on the tests. Also, Riley tried to have us learn R (a programming language) in the tutorials, which appeared on midterms. This class was 99% science students with 0 interest in programming, so I'm not sure what he was thinking. I could write a dissertation about only how useless and disorganized the R tutorials were. Once Riley got AIDS though, the course was taken over by Dina Dawoud and James Adcock. Both of them did a fine job considering how abruptly they were thrust into running someone else's course. Also, they realized that Riley not giving us a formula sheet violated the Geneva Convention and decided to bless us with one. Riley seemingly was too ill to contribute to midterm 1, evidenced by his name not being on it, as it was very straightforward and the class average was high (78). Apparently his AIDS symptoms regressed in time for midterm 2, but the AIDS also became contagious, because midterms 2 and 3 had his name and were much, much harder (averages were 69 after a denominator drop, and 63). I can only imagine how low the averages would have been if only Riley wrote them and we were not given formula sheets. Riley also apparently did not create the assignments for this course ahead of time, as Dina and James did not give a fourth one to us. Overall, this course was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Simultaneously the easiest, most low-effort mark I have ever gotten, yet the most irritated I have ever been at a course.",Exam,2,Low,2,Examination Department,2_Uwaterloo_course_reviews_with_sampling_criteria.csv

"A course with solid potential that's a complete train wreck in practice. The idea is to have two three-week software projects: one internal and one external (interacting with the world, i.e. open-source, consulting, or research). Multiple times, the Fred Brooks quote ""plan to throw one away; you will, anyhow"" was drilled into us as the motivation behind the mini-projects. Then the final three weeks of the course is initial work on the actual capstone FYDP. Unfortunately, the course is extremely disorganized, which is impressive given how little work is actually needed to keep a course like this on track. There is a 200+ page capstone handbook PDF that discusses the philosophy behind this course in depth (like the above Brooks quote...) but has very little useful information and is tedious to sift through, and even worse, contains a lot of outdated information that is no longer applicable. The only light at the end of the tunnel is that there's not much work required to get a good mark in this course so it's pretty easy overall; you can get away with leaving it on the backburner and focusing on other courses, which unlike this course actually teach content, and requirements/deliverables aren't discussed in class halfway through the time you're actually supposed to be working on them.",Academic,0,Medium,1,Academic Affairs,2_Uwaterloo_course_reviews_with_sampling_criteria.csv

"Very difficult course with Martin Pei. Along with a straightforward lecture review, we had three weekly, difficult, rigorous proof questions. Despite starting as early as possible for majority of these questions, I would be working on them for most of the day, every day up until the due date and still not be able to fully finish one or two. While Martin Pei's lectures were superb (as usual), they almost never provide any direction whatsoever for any of the proof questions. Rather, they state a basic definition or a key theorem we need to use *somewhere* in the proof. Many of the proof questions require a lot of creative thinking, to the point where reading the posted solutions is mind-blowing (mostly in a negative way). The proofs had a seemingly rigid, unique grading scheme which was supposed to assign a grade based on the quality of your proof, rather than specific marks for whether you included something from the model solution. On paper, this sounded really nice, yet in practice, I would get wildly different results. Complete proofs which were correct except for maybe one major logical flaw near the end would receive 30% (which is explicitly stated to be for partial solutions). Meanwhile, actual partial solutions which were outright missing key information would receive, in some cases, 80% (which is stated to be what their posted model solutions get...?). Moreover, the feedback for the proofs would be very lackluster. If your solution deviates from the posted solution, don't expect to get an explanation as to what you did incorrectly. That being said, take this course if you want to improve your proof-writing skills in strides, but be prepared for some of the hardest proof questions you have likely encountered up until this point, and also expect your interest in Graph Theory to fizzle out by the end.",Exam,2,High,0,Examination Department,2_Uwaterloo_course_reviews_with_sampling_criteria.csv

"Gonna write this cause the last review was like 3 years ago. Honestly, I found this class so difficult compared to ARBUS 200/300 especially with the online format. I'm not a business major so this may be a major reason why I found it incredibly stressful. Each week you come together to make a bunch of decisions about a business you are running, and honestly it's stressful since you get assigned your own department (R&D, Marketing, Production, or Finance) to manage. Overall I think it was just so tiring (especially as an introvert) because basically, the entire class is weekly group work. The breakdown is like 35% Individual (presentation and modules) stuff and 65% group work (forecast model, 2 presentations and balance scorecard that depends on how well you do in the simulation so you can't just mess around). I find that it is a lot to keep track of especially if you're a full-time student, there is a lot for an online course, but it does simulate like a real-life business experience. Also capsim is kinda dumb like it's a lot of guesstimating honestly, and the way it calculates things are weird too.

"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand ECE 222. The logic is extremely subtle and without a solid grasp of memorization most of the concepts will go over a typical student's head.

The highest IQ students understand this stuff, they have the memory capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these concepts, to realize that they're not just concepts- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike ECE 222 truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Agnew’s existential presentation format “PowerPoint” which itself is a cryptic reference to ARM assembly.

Terrible course for multiple reasons. 1. The way the course is structured makes it useless. I thought I would actually learn how to use GIS but I did not. I had to follow the videos provided exactly or else my mark gets dropped. There is no room for creativity or to actually learn how to use ArcGIS. Take geog 181 if you want to learn GIS and aren't required to take 342. 2. The marking in this course is horrific. I lost marks for the stupidest of reasons and I truly believe they try to make you lose marks to keep the average down. If you make one small mistake you fail the questions there are barely any part marks. I am also about to write the exam and the mark distribution makes no sense. Why would 60 marks be given to 20 multiple choice questions when there is only one right answer. 3. My final point is that studying for the exam is difficult with the way Changcheng structured his awful course. He provides videos on Learn for you to watch before the lecture then you spend the actual lecture doing iClicker questions. For some reason though Changcheng is against giving us answers so all the questions posed in the video lectures have no answers. All in all do not take this course unless required.

If you are caught doing anything besides giving undivided absolute attention to my particular teacher during the mind-numbingly boring mandatory classes, she seeks to personally antagonize you for the rest of the semester. I took the advanced level English course in my high school and was receiving mid-90s, but in this introductory bird course am somehow getting 20 percent lower than that. None of the assignments are properly explained and they are left open-ended, but when marked you are expected to have followed some sort of arbitrary rigid scheme that was kept a secret. In addition, if you use any words longer than two syllables in your papers the TAs get confused and take some marks off. The teacher has a very narrow perception and if you don’t agree with her viewpoint are considered “wrong” in her eyes. You are forced to do a large number of “quick-writes” or else fail the course, and when they say “quick” they really mean it. Many times the professor asks you to write upwards of two paragraphs with 30 seconds left of class, meaning you stay overtime.

"Genuinely the worst academic experience I've had in my entire life. The lecture slides themselves were often difficult to understand, and Pin-Han Ho's lecture videos consisted of him reading from them verbatim in a thick and sometimes incomprehensible accent. Even though our profs implemented weekly quizzes after the midterm to ease some of the weight off of the final exam, (1) the diagrams were low-res and difficult to read, (2) on one occasion the quiz was unreasonably long, and many people didn't finish it in the provided time, and (3) the marking process was a bit disorganized, with the feedback being vague or even nonexistent. The final was the cherry on top of the disaster heap of ECE 124: a behemoth of an exam which averaged a 10+ hour completion time, and at least 3 different marking schemes which the professors are still changing a week after we wrote the final. Don't get me wrong: the material this course covers is fairly interesting, and with a good professor I think it could be enjoyable. Pre-midterm material (minterms, maxterms, SOP/POS, K-maps, some circuit design) is pretty straightforward. Post-midterm material, which features the analysis and synthesis of asynchronous and synchronous sequential circuits, is a bit trickier, but just figure out how to apply the different algorithms and you should be fine.

They would do 3 quizzes and then a larger test on those three modules/chapters. The quizzes were great and easy and I did really well but I would tank the tests. The prof would mess up on questions a lot too so when I did a meeting with a TA to talk about a possible mistake she said ""Ya we made this class even harder on purpose since it's open book"" even though there is already an insane amount of material you have to remember.

But it's math-heavy and, unless you know what you're doing/what is being asked, you'll have a BAD time. Which is exactly the problem when Prof Busch teaches it - he rarely explains things clearly (you'll know the difference if you had Prof. Ozkardas for ECON 290), will hardly give you practice problems for you to get better at the course with (don't be surprised if he teaches you something new and then promptly tests that 2 days later) and he'll always maintain a passive-aggressive tone with you for any suggestions for improvement. I can't speak for the other Professors but I've heard that they are way better, so you should have a better time with them. TLDR:- Great course but NEVER take it with Prof. Busch.

Also, it was VERY confusing and disorganized online with what was due on what day. Exercises due in the exercise book, but then exercises also due in the textbook, then potentially optional-maybe-graded exercises in the cultural reader, and then additional weekly homework projects assigned online - different than the weekly homework assigned by the teachers in class.

I also found Tan very condescending? During the first lab, I was struggling with the ""improvements for the lab"" section and when I asked for feedback he essentially told me it was terrible, he's seen kids do better, and offered little feedback or suggestions.

"Needlessly difficult. Balogh has said time and time over that the course has people without a background in physics, but I really can't see them doing well, seeing as how I DO have a background in physics and my highest assignment grade is 60%. What's nice is (with Balogh at least) that only 50% of the course is assignments/quizzes, and the other is an essay, so at the very least non-phys students can pretend they will almost not fail. Anyways, the entire course is an awful textbook. The course structure is as follows: 1. Read some select chapters from the textbook. These will make you fall asleep because they are more dull than your grandfather telling you the same newspaper article for the 8th time. You will see approximately 40 equations that sometimes match with the content they've been plopped into. The most useless ones are the most useful. 2. Light frosting of lectures that tip-toe over the top of the pit that is the textbook work. Will possibly have an example that doesn't relate to the assigned questions, and won't actually show how to approach it. Just a question, then a final answer. No steps in-between. 3. Assigned questions from the textbook. These sometimes give you values, and then other ones you have to assume. The assumptions will lose you marks, but the questions cannot be solved without them. You'll look at these questions and not understand them, so you'll try going through the textbook chapters only to find they don't help at all. So you answer roughly half the questions with a half-baked equation mess, learning absolutely nothing. 4. You get your assignment back with a grade of 45%, so you check the assignment solutions, only to see some of your answers are surprisingly the exact same as the solution set posted yet you only got 0.5/2 with no indication what you did right or wrong. They also have nothing to do with the chapter you read. 5. Rinse and repeat until enough students complain and get told it's their fault they don't understand the content and don't know how to approach problems they weren't taught how to approach.

I was never terrible at math, but there were those units that I definitely found harder than others. I didn't use the textbook past the midterm because my prof's notes stopped paralleling the content which made it difficult to teach myself- because yes you need to do that this whole course. Keith KILLED ME - I tried so hard being respectful in my emails but he almost broke me. So here's the thing about him... he gives good notes that he posts about the lessons and STUDY THOSE if you can. Those are what he bases exams and quizzes after. BUT - he also encourages students to work through problems on their own first to try and understand the material, which yes seems like a good idea, but he also has a policy of refusing to help students with questions when his quizzes are open - BUT THERE'S ALWAYS A QUIZ OPEN AND AVAILABLE - so this man NEVER answers questions which is extremely wrong because we as students are paying for him TO TEACH and how do we learn if he doesn't help?? 10/10 Recommend investing in chegg over the textbook for this course and don't be shy from Quizlet - trust me when I say it's a much better investment. For the midterm a tip is to throw multiple choice questions from past quizzes into a doc so you can just use ctrl+f or command-f to search through questions. If you work your butt off you'll get through, but MAKE STUDY GROUPS - step away from your social anxiety and just do it cause dude everyone is suffering in this class, but asking questions between one another will be a life saver.

"If you are looking for a really easy bird course, beware! This course requires a lot of effort. Although her notes that she gives you are very clear, there is a ton of information (like any biology course). The assignments - 3 quizzes and assignments (30% of grade) and one final assignment (15% of grade) are time consuming (she expects you to be thorough and detailed... yet concise and to the point). They do help you grasp the concepts taught in lecture though. If you put effort into them, can easily achieve 90's+. The quizzes are timed for an hour each with anywhere between 15-30 questions multiple choice - these were easy and you can refer to your notes if need be. The exam was UNFAIR. 15 questions in 2.5 hours did not give anyone enough time to present the level of details she expected. The exam was different from what she said it would be (e.g., she said it would be short answers & labelling diagrams like the assignments, but it had identifying graphs, providing the definition for words and explaining figures as well). After around lecture 15/25 the course content gets heavier, so be sure to stay on top of the work load. The lectures are all audio no video and they are ~45 minutes each (2 per week, for 12 weeks). So overall if you're willing to put in work still and commit over the to learning you will be fine.

"This was an alright course. It was definitely a bird course too, only three essays throughout the entire term with a few little assignments here and there sprinkled throughout the term. I spent little time on this course each week but when the essays were due I had to spend more time writing, which was bothersome when I had some other things due around the same time. I took this course online and I did not really like that aspect, but I think it would be better than going to lectures. They really emphasized revision in the course so you had to submit a draft paper for peer review, a ""final for now"" paper, and then for a final portfolio, where you had to submit two essays which you revised again. The draft papers I submitted for review were rushed just to meet the deadline and the ""final for now"" paper was the one getting marked so that is when I spent some time actually trying to write well. The final portfolio is where they ask you to resubmit all your work for these two essays and a final reflection. I submitted my best two essays and this was a mistake. I did not change them significantly because I was unsure what I needed to do for the final revision, so I ended up with a worse mark on my portfolio than the marks I received the first time around for the essays.

"TLDR: Course content is interesting.Beginning everyone knew what they were doing, midterms were bimodal, finals were absolute shit because most of the exam was proofs that clapped everyone into the abyss ----------------- FULL: The course, overall, was alright. The course content minus the proofs is pretty useful and interesting (because who needs trivial proofs as an engineer, right?) Beginning things were pretty easy and quiz averages were 80. Midterms; things hit differently for everyone and while some people passed with 90s, others had border 50s. Meanwhile quiz averages went from 80s to 75 to 70s by linear transformations. Finally by eigenvectors averages were 65ish. Most profs in the last 2 lessons were teaching content that was 80% of the final. Apparently Trelford's been making the course more proof-based rather than plug n chug styled as of 2017, probably why the 2018 average was pretty bad. The practice test that was sent out was light/medium difficulty and was very doable compared to the exam. Needless to day the fact that most of the exam was proofs rather than computations is probably the reason the average for the final was probably low-mid 50 (out of the 20 people I talked to). Everyone got clapped really hard. If i had to retake the course I would not sleep on the proofs, spanning sets, vector spaces. Honestly, just use Trelford and Resch's notes like the bible and study from them; know everything from their course notes and important proofs.

Part marks were also limited, so getting an answer wrong took off 60-70% of the questions marks, even if the steps you took were correct.

"If you are a first-year looking to decide between CS and SE, please read this post.

(Disclaimer: I was lucky enough to take this course with Jo Atlee, who is one of the better SE professors; however, even not Mother Teresa could make a miracle out of this one.) Basing this course off of our FYDP project did the exact opposite of making students understand their FYDP better; it only made time to actually work and improve our project scarce, with its numerous weekly assignments. I will not remember a thing about this course in a week from the writing of this review, but most of my peers would agree that this was probably the most stressful course to study for. There were ABSOLUTELY no previous finals that we could practice with (all potential ones were outdated, ranging from 16~20 years old. No, I'm serious.), there were no midterm for us to check our understanding of the course with halfway through, and students have to pass the final to pass the course, to top it off. For context, there were more than 500 slides of content that needed to be sifted through for information we would use once in the exam and never again. The phrase ""flying in the dark"" was made for this course. This is a plea to the Software Engineering Directors: Please. Reconsider the content of this course, for the sake of future prospective SE students. For the first year reading this and trying to make a decision:Take into account your appetite for learning information you will never need.

"You have to finish the lab report by the end of the session. First two labs were manageable and understandable if you spend a few hours reading the manual and attending the prelab to understand the equipment you are working with... Afterwards, you are required to do a std. deviation analysis on large data sets IN CLASS BY HAND!

In the last 3 labs I found myself scrambling to piece the report together. I was blessed that one of my TAs is very smart and knows the experiment inside out, but too bad the amount of time given is way too little to complete the report even if you prepare ahead of time. The labs are too math intensive to be finished in time. So my tip would be to get as many marks as possible in the first 2 labs and just do the best you could in the last 3.

About a month after I finished that activity (and after I had handed in 3 extra assignments) I got the first lab activity back, and my TA docked marks for stuff I didn't know I needed to include (because it wasn't in the rubric). About half way through I honestly considered dropping it but I'm glad I didn't because after the first couple assignments it gets so much less stressful. I almost bombed the first lab report but got almost perfect on the second one so I cant complain too much. After I got my first lab back I found out I got reported to the dean for an academic offence because I didn't cite something properly, and then I found out the TAs went crazy with reporting and almost half the class thought they were gonna get kicked out of school.

This lady basically put me to sleep with her monotonous voice in this 8am class. she doesnt bother to elaborate on her lecture slides so if you're taking this course in person, dont even bother going lmao you might as well sleep in because you're not missing out on anything besides watching her read off those vague slides.",Exam,2,High,0,Examination Dept,2_Uwaterloo

Due to Dys amazing structure, students who are failing or barely passing can still end up with 70s. Here are my tips.. 1. Focus more on doing well in the reflection papers 2. Make sure you DO the SONA credits because it is a 3% bonus as well as the introduction and concluding discussion posts because that is a 1% boost (added up you get a 4% boost which is your life saver) 3.

"Among the worst organized courses I've taken in ECE. The prof ... was not organized. Throughout the term, we were CONSTANTLY behind in course content. This led to the prof scheduling make-up lectures with extremely little notice (my favorite, scheduling an 8:30am makeup lecture at 6:00am same day). Why were we behind you ask? The professor covered NOTHING each lecture. The lecture pace was incredibly slow. The entire first half of the course was simply review of Fourier Series, Fourier Transform, and Z-Transform. The second half covered filter design, which was somewhat interesting at least. Another problem was the assignments. The assignments were BAD. Often they were 3-4 questions. 1-2 questions would be related to the course content, the other 1-2 would be to design something assine in Matlab. On EVERY assignment the questions were out of scope on course content and difficulty. Despite all of this, the course would still have been okay if not for one thing. The prof, did he even exist? The class would email him frequently with questions on course content and assignments and he just wouldn't respond. Ever. WEEKS later you might be lucky to get a response. My favorite example was when he posted the final exam, it was blank for everyone, and then he just disappeared for 4 hours. I was literally being held hostage at home waiting for him to fix the issue.

"Wow so like since this hasn't had a review in like 3 years might as well do this. I took this course online (not sure if they have on campus but I only had the choice for online) and the breakdown was Essay Assignment 1 (15%), Take-Home Midterm (25%) Formatted with 3 Paragraph Style Questions and 1 Mini Essay, Essay Assignment 2 (25%) and Final Exam (35% but can be 40% if you do better than Mitdterm). Since I did this during COVID-19 the Final became an optional Take-Home Final, I'm no sure if the Format would've ben the same but it was 5 Short Answer Questions, and Mini Essay on 1 of 2 Topics. This course isn't as easy as you'd think with 12 Modules with 2-3 Video Lectures and Associated Readings each. It's not a listen to lecture and do assignment course, you kinda need to read over everything again to understand it enough for assignments... Also Ethics is hella subjective, legit I swear it was always like 'Here's an argument, but here's a rejection, and here's another rejection to the rejection.' Though if you do a bit more research outside of class you'll be fine with the essay information since it has all been analyzed in some way before. Though make sure to follow the Guildlines cause I screwed that up biggg time on the First Essay, Take-Home Midterm you can find stuff online (CourseHero or StuDocu I think) I guess they reuse the same topics??

One prof had slides full of text and sped through everything way too quickly for students to comprehend and copy text down. This prof also didn't post the class slides up on Learn, which made it difficult for me to study when it came to the test. He didn't specify which parts were going to be on the test and what were not. When it got to the test, almost no one finished on time so you can only imagine. The two other profs were alright.

"This course is pretty hard and I originally took it as one of the requirements for my minor. Bad choice. I am not an anthro major and this was an extremely small class with only around 15 people and most of them are in the anthro department. Aside from this, Prof Liu is a good teacher but a hard marker. In terms of assignments, the weightings and subjectivity are quite unfair that it's really difficult to earn a good mark in this course. Participation accounted for 20% of your mark, and despite that I never missed a class, and participate in discussions, I did not get a good mark. I am baffled by the subjectivity of this course and how the assignments are marked. I usually don't understand why I lose marks and overall it accumulates to my overall bad mark. I am disappointed. In terms of course content, it is quite similar to sociology but the readings are lengthy written by anthropologists that are difficult to read and at the same time hard to write. If you would like to explore social issues and the themes written in the description, I suggest you take SOC or something else. Finally, the prof is nice and a good presenter which makes the small class bearable, but that doesn't matter if your mark is bad. They removed the pre-reqs for this course and I expect this class to get larger and different profs will be teaching it, so your experience may be different.

Firstly, no course schedule was given despite several students asking for one. We had 5 assignments (1 essay, 4 assignments using R, and a final ERA along with a group presentation). Since no assignment schedule was given, it was hard to plan assignments around other courses and assignments were given very sporadically.

He assigned the final ERA (worth 30 %) with no warning during the last few weeks of November, which is the busiest time of the school year. Almost the whole class had to half-ass the ERA due to lack of time. After we handed in our ERAs, he assigned us groups and only gave us 5 days to prepare a 10-15 minute presentation worth 15% of our mark, also in the busiest last weeks of the semester.

"In the beginning of the term this course felt very useless. However, that was the most childish a wanna be theoretical physicist can tell himself. A lot of what you will learn in this course will be useful as it will be the foundation of the mathematics you will need to solve a lot of theoretical physics problems. A lot of what u learn in this course is also useful in proving equations u derive as a physicist. You will learn things like Complex numbers, Methods of Proof, The Binomial Theory, Summations and repeated multiplications. All of these concepts are useful for example when we try to approximate equations in Physics, a good understanding of Summations is required. Binomial theory may be used to expand Relativistic kinetic energy equation. Lets say u as a mathematical physicist derived an equation some how. Now u want to make sure that the equation is valid, a basic knowledge of what u learn in this course may be helpful. Complex numbers can be spotted in Schrodinger's Wave Equation. If u are serious about physics, don't take this course lightly. Although this might be an over exaggeration but I feel like this course is as important as Calculus. So In calculus you will be asked to derive Taylor polynomials, how will you do that without a basic understanding of Summations? Although the science mathematical physics students donot have to take this course before taking math 136 (linear algebra for honours math), this course is very useful in math 136. The proof techniques you learn in this course like Proof by Strong induction may be useful in Linear algebra. And all physics enthusiasts know the importance of linear algebra in physics. One can finish most of math 137 (calculus) assignments without having to look at lectures (I donot recommend this) and get a good grade. You cannot even solve the first question in math 135 before fully understanding all concepts in the lectures. I personally very much disliked this course mostly because the math learned was very new compared to what I was taught in school and it was difficult to understand these ideas. But I did enjoy learning about the new concepts. but I understand that the content taught is very important. Therefore, if u are an apprising physicist, take the course seriously. If u like pure math take this course seriously, if u like CS take this course seriously. If u like Finance take this course seriously. If u like painting take this course seriously (u need to understand the golden ratio to figure out how to make ur art perfect). Regardless of ur major, please don't undermine the value this course provides. This course sucks no doubt, but it is hella useful so pay attention in class and do all assignments even though u can drop one. A criticism I would have with this course is the lack of applications. Although this course content has many applications the course is designed in a way that suggests that there is none except in pure math. I would like that to change. And if possible please make a physics based Math135 and math 136 please and thankyou.",Exam,2,High,0,Examination Department,2_Uwaterloo_course_reviews_with_sampling_criteria.csv

Also, it was VERY confusing and disorganized online with what was due on what day. Exercises due in the exercise book, but then exercises also due in the textbook, then potentially optional-maybe-graded exercises in the cultural reader, and then additional weekly homework projects assigned online - different than the weekly homework assigned by the teachers in class. The labs didn't even practice speaking - just more writing with confusing exercises that we never had time to finish without staying 10-20 mins after class.

"I took this online (fall 2020). This course, in my opinion, was catastrophic due to a lack of communication between TAs and the instructor, between the TAs themselves, and timing issues. For instance, we had 3 weeks just to do an intro assignment worth 1% as well as our WHMIS and AIQs. Not needed. This resulted in 7 weeks of rushed lab reports (1 per week), when the 3 weeks from the beginning of the semester could have allowed for students to complete formal lab reports with some more time (especially considering they were worth 10 and 20%, respectively). Furthermore, there was inconsistency between the information each of the TAs were giving out. I found that my peers got more useful information than I did; things that my TA said she couldn't help me with were covered by other TAs. One useful thing is the fact that we had 30 minute office hours weekly, allowing us to know what to look out for, understand the grading scheme, clear doubts, etc. Overall, it is a course that is just not suited for online learning.",Lab,12,Medium,1,Facilities Management,2_Uwaterloo
